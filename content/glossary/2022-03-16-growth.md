After reading <a href="https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history">A Brief History & Ethos of the Digital Garden</a> I was inspired by Maggies <em>Six Patterns of Gardening</em> especially number three: imperfection and learning in public.

I have always considered PhotoGabble to be a place where I publish my musings and various tinkering for the world to purview if it wants, that lends it to be more of a Digital Garden than blog.

A first step in migrating from a Blog structure to more of a cultivated garden is indicating how "done" content is.
I quite like Maggie's horticultural approach and so will be borrowing her three metaphors:

- 👩‍🌾 _Stubs_ placeholders for content coming "soon"
- 🌱 _Seedlings_ for very rough and early ideas
- 🌿 _Budding_ for work I've cleaned up and clarified
- 🌳 _Evergreen_ for work that is reasonably complete
