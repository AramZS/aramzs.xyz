Considering this book was first published in the 70s it is arguably still relevant today. The #BASIC language is by its name simple to pick up and work with and this book contains twelve different simulation games written in BASIC which are enjoyable to play.

Each chapter introduces the simulation scenario before showing an example of the program being run. Variables are documented and the program listings come with flow diagrams which help visualise the execution order and how decisions are made. The authors go so far as to suggest a list of minor and major modifications that the reader could make to each program in order to improve or personalise the experience further.

All of this goes together to make this quite honestly the best BASIC type in book in my collection; if you're a #RetroComputing enthusiast then I strongly recommend you find yourself a copy for your collection too.
