I bought this today after watching [Splattercat Gaming's short play through on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqgCm92AU_w). I have yet to play it myself however, it's reminiscent of [[Stardew Valley on Steam|Stardew Valley]] a game that I have played a good few hours[^1] of and thoroughly enjoy.

[^1]: At time of writing only 41 hours, but I have watched hundreds of hours of other people play it, if that counts?
