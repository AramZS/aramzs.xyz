When ever I find some interesting code I always go looking to see if the author has a personal website; I'm pretty sure I stumbled across Martin's website via their [Go Blueprint Project](https://github.com/MartinHeinz/go-project-blueprint) at a time when I was looking for the best way to structure my Golang projects.

They most recently (at time of writing) have focused on writing about Python which I have found interesting even if Python isn't a language I want to work with. 

Overall though, it's the minimalist yet functional design that sold me on adding it to my blogroll.
