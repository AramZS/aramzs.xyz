I found Artic's website while researching for my essay [[Where did all the Webrings go?]] and omi, just look at that beautiful pixel art background!

Their simple yet feature complete [Unique Daily Visitor Counter](https://github.com/ArticExploit/unique-visitor-counter) reminds me that I really do need to finish writing my essay on [[Hit Counters]].
