I found Travis's website via the [[ Merveilles Webring ]] which is itself an excellent source of amazing personal websites!

In keeping with my general theme of _websites I love_, Travis's website fit the niche of minimalist digital garden perfectly. I especially love their [cooking](https://travisshears.com/cooking/notes/) and [snippets](https://travisshears.com/snippets/) sections; I would like to replicate those on PhotoGabble.
