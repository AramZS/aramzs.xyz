I discovered this channel via their video: [Americans Are Still Tricked by The Biggest Fib in Food History](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXkdy9KDC1Q). I was impressed by the presentation and given the huge amount of misinformation and profit from misinformation of the heath and diet subject, it was refreshing to find someone explaining factual information in an easy to digest format.

Once I had watched through one video I was hungry for more and binge-watched another hour of content. Subscribed and recommended.
