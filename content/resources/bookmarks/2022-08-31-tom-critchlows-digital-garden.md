I first found Tom's Digital Garden through being shared their article: [The Magic of Small Databases](https://tomcritchlow.com/2023/01/27/small-databases/). I quickly discovered that beyond being a blog, Tom's website is a Digital Garden containing a sprawling [personal wiki](https://tomcritchlow.com/wiki/). 

I was inspired by Tom's Digital Garden to look more into Digital Gardening and as a result discovered Maggie Appleton's Essay: [[ A Brief History & Ethos of the Digital Garden ]] which then prompted me to rebuild PhotoGabble as one.
