Today while catching up on my New Scientist subscription (issue 3372) I read the guest column authored by [Annalee Newitz's](https://www.techsploitation.com/) providing their thoughts on self-driving cars.

Reading Annalee's article prompted a thought that I have long wondered: why hasn't rail seen as big an interest in autonomous vehicles as road?

Rail has fixed tracks that are largely devoid of unexpected hazards therefore any automation should only need to identify potential collisions ahead and react accordingly.

Am I missing something here?
