    "Content": "Although Zionism has been overwhelmingly bent on separation from Arabs, Zionism has not developed elaborate racial categorizations that in South Africa were known as theoretical apartheid. And finally, the Zionist project featured many distinct qualities among settler-colonial ventures, for example, the concept of return to an ancient patrimony; the mission to foster mass migration of persecuted and impoverished members of a single community; the top-down construction of a new polity, national economy, and culture; and a zealous secularism (at least in its formative decades).",

    "Content": "Consider the case of women’s suffrage, which was the subject of almost two centuries of debate in the West and which only came to France and Switzerland after World War II. As Sylvia Walby has noted, many postcolonial states have granted women the franchise at the time of the states’ establishment. Political citizenship is granted to all adults at the time of state creation as an expression of a populist sentiment and a legitimization of the overthrow of nonrepresentative colonial rule. As Chatterjee writes of India, nationalists asserted that the entire people had been nationalized, that is, vested with a distinct and unifying Indianness. The nation, having been feminized by the colonial power, was to be emancipated in one fell swoop.36 This conceptual framework is of benefit for the study of Zionism, for it helps account for the ZO’s early granting of voting rights to women (at the Second Congress of 1898, at time when only New Zealand had national female suffrage) and the passion with which all but ultra-Orthodox members of the Yishuv advocated women’s suffrage after World War I.",

    "Content": "Jewish intellectuals in nineteenth-century Europe may have felt that time was on their side, but they were nonetheless engaged in a vigorous campaign to refashion Judaism, not merely to be accepted into European society but also to protect Jewish life from the blandishments of both Christianity and secularism, to engage in a carefully thought-out process of imitation in order to prevent assimilation. The material conditions of life for European Jews and Asians differed greatly, as did the relations of power with the European hegemonic powers, but the thought processes of Jewish and Asian intellectuals were similar, including those that led to the development of nationalist ideologies. It is no surprise, then, that aspects of Zionism resemble anticolonial national movements, although there were spectacular differences as well.",

    "Content": "Stoler’s description of French and Dutch policies and attitudes toward their colonial subjects can be easily mapped onto attitudes and policies toward Jews in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Europe. Emancipation was granted on a quid pro quo basis. Cultural and economic regeneration—that is, mastery of the host society’s language, the adoption of reigning cultural mores, and a movement from the traditional practice of peddling to livelihoods in crafts and agriculture—were considered either preconditions for citizenship (as in the German states) or immediate and necessary outcomes of the attainment of citizenship (as in France). For Jews in post-Napoleonic Prussian Poland, as for Indo-Europeans in colonial southeast Asia, citizenship was granted on a case-by-case basis, the result of a rigorous yet arbitrary examination procedure. Proposals made in the late nineteenth century by colonial officials to establish agricultural colonies for the regeneration of the Indo-European poor had their parallel in the era of enlightened absolutism, when reformist bureaucrats in Prussia, Austria, and Russia championed, and at times established, colonies to train Jews in productive labor.",

    "Content": "It is certainly possible to employ the term “colonial” to describe not merely physical domination but also cultural hegemony, not governmentality but collective mentality, but if we are to do so then we must be willing to apply this concept to the historic status of European, and not only Mizrahi, Jews as a colonized people. Only then can we understand why Zionism, even when espoused by an Ashkenazi elite and suffused with colonial motifs, represented the ultimate phase of a European anticolonial discourse that dated back to the early nineteenth century.",

Precisely because they were believed to be true Orientals, however, Yemenite Jews were also perceived as “natural laborers” who could compete successfully with Arabs, performing backbreaking agricultural work at low wages. (With this goal in mind, in 1912 the ZO’s Palestine Office recruited Yemenite Jews to immigrate to Palestine; a contingent of them labored on the lands of the Kinneret training farm, only to be summarily expelled in 1930 when the land was needed for new immigrants from eastern Europe.20)",
