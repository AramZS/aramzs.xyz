The “Tale of Beryn” is included in some versions as the Merchant’s Tale, and a popular, though anonymous, Canterbury Interlude told of the Pardoner’s attempts to seduce a bar-maid, Kit the Tapster, ending in his humiliation. The poet John Lydgate, in the fifteenth century, introduced his Siege of Thebes with a prologue telling how he met up with the Canterbury Pilgrims, who asked him to read his magnum opus. Neither Harry Bailly nor Geoffrey Chaucer interrupt the work.",
