Meticulous, fascinating, disturbing. <br/><br/>In some ways it might be best to go into this book with no knowledge of what is within, which is how I did it. To be so thoroughly introduced to the internal voice and thought process of a character who is often used to exemplify inhumanity, and whose acts are well deserving of revilement, is to repudiate dehumanization, generalization and demonization. Even our worst enemies are still people; their thoughts and motivations are not uniform, and may not even be what we suspect. Even the clearest of evils does not have the clearest of sources. <br/><br/>Jarett Kobek writes a well-researched historical fiction <spoiler>from the point of view of one of the 9/11 plane hijackers, centered on the idea that for Atta the attack was as much an architectural statement as a religious one.</spoiler> Few books will make you think more.
