                "description": "<b>And you thought <i>your</i> life was tough...</b><br /><br />Growing up is always difficult, but when you and your friends' parents are the Pride, a group consisting of some of the most nefarious villains in the world, the problems that crop up are more...unique. For Molly Hayes and her group of super-powered buddies, that meant turning on their evil parents and becoming Runaways in the process. Since then, they have suffered through unimaginable hardships, but in spite of their great differences, the underage super heroes have always managed to stay one thing: together. Now, after escaping catastrophe in New York City, the seven friends have returned to their home: Los Angeles.<br /><br />But all is not well in the City of Angels, as a group of soldiers from Runaway Karolina Dean's home planet arrives with guns blazing, demanding that their fellow Majesdanian be handed over to them for some unknown offense. Though the otherworldly warriors are repelled, the clock is ticking down to the moment when they will rally and return. As the Majesdanians struggle to regroup, the Runaways begin to fall apart, squabbling over the best course to take. Some advocate direct action, others diplomacy and, distressingly, Karolina considers just giving herself up. How can the Runaways face their biggest threat to date when they're having trouble facing one another?<br /><br />Collecting <i>Runaways (2008) #1-6</i>, written by Eisner Award winner Terry Moore and illustrated by Humberto Ramos.",
