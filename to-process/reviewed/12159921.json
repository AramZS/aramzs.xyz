                "description": "<div>\n  <p>A world of endless sky, with no land, no gravity:  this is Virga. Beginning in the seminal science fiction novel <i>Sun of Suns</i>, the saga of this striking world has introduced us to the people of stubborn pride and resilience who have made Virga their home; but also, always lurking beyond the walls of the world, to the mysterious threat known only as Artificial Nature. In <i>The Sunless Countries</i>, history tutor Leal Hieronyma Maspeth became the first human in centuries to learn the true nature of this threat. Her reward was exile, but now, in <i>Ashes of Candesce</i>, Artificial Nature makes its final bid to destroy Virga, and it is up to Leal to unite the quarrelling clans of her world to fight the threat.</p>\n  <p><i>Ashes of Candesce</i> brings together all the heroes of the Virga series, and draws the diverse threads of the previous storylines together into one climactic conflict. Blending steampunk styling with a far-future setting and meditations on the posthuman condition, <i>Ashes of Candesce</i> mixes high adventure and cutting-edge ideas in a fitting climax to one of science fiction’s most innovative series.</p>\n</div>",
