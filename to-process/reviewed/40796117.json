                "description": "<b>\n  <i>It’s been twenty-five years since I last murdered someone, or has it been twenty-six?</i>\n</b><br />  <br /><i>Diary of a Murderer </i>captivates and provokes in equal measure, exploring what it means to be on the edge—between life and death, good and evil. In the titular novella, a former serial killer suffering from memory loss sets his sights on one final target: his daughter’s boyfriend, who he suspects is also a serial killer. In other stories we witness an affair between two childhood friends that questions the limits of loyalty and love; a family’s disintegration after a baby son is kidnapped and recovered years later; and a wild, erotic ride about pursuing creativity at the expense of everything else.<br />",
