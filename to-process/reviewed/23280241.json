                "description": "<b>In a post-apocalyptic flooded New York City, a private investigator’s routine surveillance case leads to a treasure everyone wants to find—and someone is willing to kill for.</b><br /><br /><i>Depth</i> combines hardboiled mystery and dystopian science fiction in a future where the rising ocean levels have left New York twenty-one stories under water and cut off from the rest of the United States. But the city survives, and Simone Pierce is one of its best private investigators. Her latest case, running surveillance on a potentially unfaithful husband, was supposed to be easy. Then her target is murdered, and the search for his killer points Simone towards a secret from the past that can’t possibly be real—but that won’t stop the city’s most powerful men and women from trying to acquire it for themselves, with Simone caught in the middle. <br /><br />\"Heinlein meets Hammett in this whip-smart whodunnit set amid the billowing fog and rising waters of a future New York in which the truth, like the monuments and skyscrapers of the city's past, seems always to lie just below the surface.\" <br />—Chuck Greaves, award-winning author of <i>Hush Money</i>, <i>Green-Eyed Lady</i>, and <i>The Last Heir</i>. <br /><br />“I have long admired Lev Rosen’s strange, genre-bending work, and Depth is an exciting display of his many gifts. His vision of post–global warming Manhattan is richly imagined and noir-ishly melancholy, and his riff on the traditional detective story is elegant, surprising, and, yes, deep.” <br />—Dan Chaon, author of <i>Await Your Reply</i> and <i>Stay Awake</i>.",
