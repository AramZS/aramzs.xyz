                "description": "<b><i>Time</i> Magazine Best American Novel (1993)<br /></b><br />In this fiendishly imaginative book (which may or may not be fiction), Philip Roth meets a man who may or may not be Philip Roth. Because <i>someone</i> with that name has been touring Israel, promoting a bizarre reverse exodus of the Jews. Roth is intent on stopping him, even if that means impersonating his own impersonator. <br /><br />With excruciating suspense, unfettered philosophical speculation, and a cast of characters that includes Israeli intelligence agents, Palestinian exiles, an accused war criminal, and an enticing charter member of an organization called Anti-Semites Anonymous, <b>Operation Shylock</b> barrels across the frontier between fact and fiction, seriousness and high comedy, history and nightmare.",
