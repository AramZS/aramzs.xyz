He is an unrelenting fighter for the soul of America, and in this book he fights the good fight for the traditional values that have served this country so well for so long.<br /><br />Please buy this book before you leave the store.<br /><br /><b>About the Author</b><br />Stephen Colbert is America.<br /><br /><i>Description from book jacket</i>",
