There are many, many bodies and an ancient crime more terrible than murder.<br /><br />He is out of his jurisdiction, out of his depth, out of bacon sandwiches, and occasionally snookered and out of his mind, but never out of guile. Where there is a crime there must be a finding, there must be a chase and there must be a punishment. <br /><br />They say that in the end all sins are forgiven.<br /><br />But not quite all...",
