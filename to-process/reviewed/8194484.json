                "description": "\"If you think McDonald's is the most ubiquitous restaurant experience in America, consider that there are more Chinese restaurants in America than McDonalds, Burger Kings, and Wendys <i>combined</i>.\" <br />â€” Jennifer 8 Lee, New York Times reporter and Chinese-American (or American-born Chinese).<br /><br />In her search, Jennifer 8 Lee traces the history of Chinese-American experience through the lens of the food. In a compelling blend of sociology and history, Jenny Lee exposes the indentured servitude Chinese restaurants expect from illegal immigrant chefs, investigates the relationship between Jews and Chinese food, and weaves a personal narrative about her own relationship with Chinese food. <br /><br /><i>The Fortune Cookie Chronicles</i> speaks to the immigrant experience as a whole, and the way it has shaped our country.",
