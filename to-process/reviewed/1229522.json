The intrepid ingenious Starfleet Corps of Engineers return with four new challenging adventures. In NO SURRENDER the S.C.E. try to salvage a failed prison facility in a political firestorm, as the failure was due to sabotage by a group of political agitators. CAVEAT EMPTOR finds the corps contesting an ancient super-computer in a simple rescue mission gone horribly wrong. In PAST LIFE they must save the Evorons from certain demise when a radical faction sets out to destroy any evidence the Environs have that aliens visited the world before civilisation began. A And in OATHS a questionable malaise plagues the chief medical officer of S.C.E., Dr. Elizabeth Lense. Can she find her way out of depression to determine a cure to save her shipmates and an entire planets population from a deathly virus?",
