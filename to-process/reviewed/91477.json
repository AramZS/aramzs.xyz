No Love Potions, Endless Purses, or Other Entertainment.<br /><br />Business has been slow. Okay, business has been dead. And not even of the undead variety. You would think Chicago would have a little more action for the only professional wizard in the phone book. But lately, Harry Dresden hasn't been able to dredge up any kind of work--magical <i>or</i> mundane.<br /><br />But just when it looks like he can't afford his next meal, a murder comes along that requires his particular brand of supernatural expertise.<br /><br />A brutally mutilated corpse. Strange-looking paw prints. A full moon. Take three guesses--and the first two don't count...",
