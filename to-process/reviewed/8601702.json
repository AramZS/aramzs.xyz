                "description": "<b>Winner of Fourteen <u>Eisner</u> Awards</b><br /><br /><b>Every Rose has its thorn.</b><br />As the Fables of the mundane world try desperately to shield themselves from the withering power of Mister Dark, Rose Red - the Farm's ostensible leader - is finally jolted out of her crippling depression and into action by a timely revelation from her storybook past. Her epiphany comes not a moment too soon - as more and more of New York City falls under Mister Dark's malign power, the chances of striking a decisive blow against him are getting smaller by the hour. Luckily, the survivors of Fabletown have the world's most powerful witch on their side - and she well may be the only entity more ruthless than the Dark Man himself.<br />Including the special oversized 100th issue of writer Bill Willingham's acclaimed creation.<br /><br /><b>Collecting</b>: <i>Fables</i> 94-100",
