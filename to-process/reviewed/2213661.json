Well, he would be perfectly normal if he didn't live in a graveyard, being raised and educated by ghosts, with a solitary guardian who belongs to neither the world of the living nor the world of the dead.<br /><br />There are dangers and adventures for Bod in the graveyard: the strange and terrible menace of the Sleer; a gravestone entrance to a desert that leads to the city of ghouls; friendship with a witch, and so much more.<br /><br />But it is in the land of the living that real danger lurks, for it is there that the man Jack lives and he has already killed Bod's family.<br /><br />A deliciously dark masterwork by bestselling author Neil Gaiman, with illustrations by award-winning Dave McKean.",
