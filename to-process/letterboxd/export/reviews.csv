2020-07-22,Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,2016,https://boxd.it/1ggPMz,2,,"Having now re-watched this after re-watching the entire series it is an especially baffling entry. One of the things that made the W. S. Anderson RE films stand out in the series was their clear, easy-to-understand, action and the bright, relatively high contrast, look, that made them pretty fun. This one is an Anderson film, but it is plagued by extremely low-contrast, difficult to see, shots; a lot of very dark scenes; and just incredibly, almost sickeningly, choppy editing only compounded by some overly shaky hand-held work. I really don't know what happened with this film to make it so gross to watch, but it is a shame that a series that seemed to have fun with its concepts ended up going out on such a grim, unoriginal, and unpleasant entry.",,2020-07-21

What really pulled it over the top for me was some of the creativity in portraying the setting and a number of rather excellent performances, especially the two stars Sophie Lowe and Morgan Saylor; along with a typically great performance by Margo Martindale. If there was any major flaw it was that I would have liked more time with some of the other characters. Ended up enjoying it way more than I expected. ",,2020-08-02

2022-03-01,The King's Man,2021,https://boxd.it/2CDeSH,2,,"Shockingly bad decisions abound! 

The Kingsmen films made a name for themselves in a period of increasingly grim self-serious spy films by turning the clock back with a pastiche of the genre that allowed them to return to the days of silly puns, crazy devices, ludicrous villains and world-ending plots. For better and worse it was a return to an older era of spy films more interested in having fun, both in the script and on-screen, then proving out their ""realism"". 

So, it is baffling that the most recent film decided that it would follow up the fun with a grim self-serious historical wartime spy melodrama. All of the verve, fun, and cleverness has gone. We are left with a rather boring tale and little color on display. The result might have been interesting if it had satisfied itself with operating at the margins or leaned into an alternate history take, but instead the characters make futile play in a sandbox where almost everything is pre-determined while they mostly attempt to foil events the results of which we already know. There might have been some charm available from the cast but, with the exception of Rhys Ifans as Rasputin, everyone has apparently been strictly instructed to keep a stiff British upper lip, including--in a total waste of an actor--Ralph Fiennes who had apparently been instructed never to emote. 

Finally, the script is worse of all. The more one reads Mark Millar's work the harder it is to avoid his weird conservatism that, at times, feels it can lean far right enough to make neighbors with the alt-right. It seems that the gravity of Millar's politics is so heavy that even this film cannot escape. By the end we've been instructed very seriously in the script's Big Meanings which, as far as I can tell, are:

Pacifism is bad.
Monarchy is Good (the best actually).
Communism is a plot by the global elites and fake.
Lenin was best friends with Hitler in their attempt to take over the world.
Long live the British Royalty and woe to any who might wish their independence.
All US Presidents are Bill Clinton actually and US democracy is a weak joke. 

The film is clearly one with a message and that message is apparently this truly stupefying collection of bs. When it comes to the end and the final victory is the main character firmly declaring his rejection of pacifism you can only come to the conclusion that this movie isn't just a mess... it's actual crap. And worse... apparently deeply invested in some sort of sketchy anti-democratic monarchy porn. And, since it has rejected the tone and style of its predecessors, it isn't even a bad movie that is fun to watch. It's just the worst. ",,2022-02-28

That said, on its own merits, the film is fun, effective at suspense, well-filmed and pulls some great performances, notably even from the kids--who have larger roles in this version. James McAvoy and Mackenzie Davis are really delivering too, and if you wanted to see it just for their performances I would not blame you. 

I am fascinated by the changes, especially to Scoot McNairy's character which change the context and tenor of the movie significantly and in some odd ways.
