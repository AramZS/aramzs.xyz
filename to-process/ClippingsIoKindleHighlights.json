These systems are designed to encourage and facilitate collaboration. By identifying your strengths and interests publicly, you increase the chances that you’ll be called on to do work that you’re good at. In the classroom, this means students are more likely to find ways to contribute successfully to team projects. And the chance to do something you’re good at as part of a larger project helps students build real esteem among their peers—not empty self-esteem",

But Eisner and Iger underestimated his determination, and that of Les Moonves, the head of CBS. Instead of dropping “CSI,” as they had anticipated, CBS lined up another producer, Alliance Atlantis Communications, which presold some foreign rights to raise $800,000 per episode, an amount that nearly covered the projected deficit. CBS financed the rest, minimizing the potential loss. CBS placed “CSI” as the centerpiece of its Friday night schedule for fall 2000.",

It posted on its website and blasted out to the press an article full of mischaracterizations and inaccuracies entitled “The Facts of AIG,” written by deputy White House communications director Jen Psaki. Psaki savaged me in the post, saying that I was trying “to generate a false controversy over AIG to try and grab a few, cheap headlines” and was “stuck in a time warp.” Suggesting that I had an anti–White House bias, Psaki also questioned my independence, stating “Any truly independent observer would say that Treasury’s stake in AIG will be worth more than taxpayers originally invested in that company.”12 She even suggested that I didn’t “like movies with happy endings.”",

		"Content": "Specifically, this was a massive criminal fraud scheme, something akin to a giant counterfeiting operation, in which banks mass-produced extremely risky, low-quality subprime mortgages and with lightning-quick efficiency sold them off to institutional sucker-investors as highly rated AAA bonds. The hot potato game targeted unions, pension funds, and government-backed mortgage companies like Fannie Mae on the secondary market. It was a modern take on the Rumpelstiltskin fairy tale. Big banks took great masses of straw (i.e., the risky home loans of the poor, undocumented, and unemployed) and spun it, factory style, into gold (i.e., AAA-rated securities). They used a technique called securitization that allowed banks and mortgage lenders to take vast pools of home loans belonging to underemployed janitors and immigrants and magically convert them into investments that were ostensibly as safe as Microsoft corporate bonds or the sovereign debt of Luxembourg, but more lucrative than either. The sudden introduction of these magic mortgage bonds into the marketplace pushed most every major institutional investor in the world to suddenly become consumed with the desire to lend money to American home borrowers, even if they didn’t know to whom exactly they were lending or how exactly these borrowers were qualifying for their home loans. As a result of this lunatic process, houses in middle- and lower-income neighborhoods from Fresno to the Jersey Shore became jammed full of new home borrowers, millions and millions of them, who in many cases were not equal to the task of making their monthly payments. The situation was tenable so long as housing prices kept rising and these teeming new populations of home borrowers could keep their heads above water, selling or refinancing their way out of trouble if need be. But the instant the arrow began tilting downward, this rapidly expanding death-balloon of phony real estate value inevitably had to—and did—explode. In other words, it was a Ponzi scheme, no different than the Bernie Madoff caper, only executed on an exponentially huger scale. The scheme depended upon the ability of a nexus of large financial companies to factory-produce and sell these magic home loans fast enough, and in big enough numbers, to continually keep more money coming in than going out.",

It was the very definition of systemic corruption, but curiously, despite what looked like mountains of evidence, almost nobody with any connection to the crisis was even threatened with criminal prosecution. For instance, court filings showed that Bank of America—a Covington & Burling client, remember—had teamed up with the unscrupulous, now-defunct mortgage lender Countrywide to sell more than a billion dollars’ worth of questionable loans to Fannie and Freddie. They had done so through a special mortgage loan program that, unbelievably, was named “Hustle” in internal bank documents. Under “Hustle,” Bank of America intentionally removed underwriters and compliance officers from the loan origination process, explicitly aiming to make sure that loans “moved forward, never backward.”",

Both state and federal authorities apparently had no problem taking that risk with little, politically unconnected Abacus. A defender of the Justice Department in this instance will naturally protest that the Abacus case had nothing to do with Eric Holder, because Abacus was not prosecuted federally. But upon closer examination, Collateral Consequences showed loudly in this case. Mainly, it showed in those “extraneous matters”—in the nonprosecution of every other bank in America that really was guilty of responsibility for the financial crisis. Those noncases certainly can be laid at the institutional feet of Holder’s Justice Department. And if Eric Holder’s voice wasn’t the direct inspiration, the spirit of Collateral Consequences certainly moved Cyrus Vance, who sent subpoenas to many Wall Street firms but chose to indict only a small, globally nonconsequential Chinatown bank. Abacus isn’t just the only bank in the entire country to face indictment since the financial crisis. It’s also the first company that we know of that was officially deemed small enough to destroy.

The city of Long Beach, for instance, has been enacting sweeping budget cuts ever since the crash. In the first year after Lehman’s collapse, the Long Beach school system cut summer school classes and bus routes for one thousand students. The city announced plans to lay off thirty-four policemen and close at least one fire station. The mayor asked the city council to cut all funding for the Long Beach Museum of Art. And the city continues to be way behind the financial eight ball. In fact, its projected deficit for 2013 almost exactly matches the Lehman shortfall—$20.3 million.",

On his way out, Diamond released emails and other documents suggesting that the Bank of England not only knew about these manipulations but had actually encouraged them during the fall of 2008, right around the time of the Lehman bankruptcy. The ostensible justification for the BOE wanting banks to suppress LIBOR at that time is that it made banks look healthier and prevented a worldwide panic. But there was no excuse at all for the manipulations that Barclays had engaged in prior to 2008, the “bottle of Bollinger” manipulations, which were done purely to make more money for Barclays and its traders.",

When asked why he didn’t contact the Department of Justice to help it begin a criminal investigation, Geithner essentially said that the DOJ had access to the information from media reports and didn’t need his help. The primary banking regulator in America didn’t contact the Justice Department because he said it could read about the case in the newspapers! Forced to answer questions about the LIBOR incident in Congress, Geithner was presented with a transcript of conversations between a Barclays employee and a Fed official in which the Barclays employee admitted to fixing LIBOR rates. “Is there any element of criminal fraud that isn’t admitted to in this transcript?” North Carolina Democrat Brad Miller asked Geithner, wondering aloud how someone could openly admit a crime to a government official, a regulator no less, and not face charges for it. Geithner avoided the question, saying that lawyers were working on the issue. By then, four years had elapsed since the scandal.",

The archipelago, which has grown at breakneck speed over the last two decades, is like a giant legal purgatory in which detainees don’t have any real rights or enjoy any real due process. People disappear into it, hundreds of thousands a year, and become less like prisoners with rights than like objects or packages to be crated and shipped out like cargo. ICE even has a UPS-style tracking system that allows immigrant families to punch in a number and see where their deported relative is in his or her serpentine journey through the detention system. In the real justice system, you get habeas corpus; in the shadow system, you get a tracking number to see where your familial “package” is.",

Lopez-Mendoza, in cases involving immigrants, a Fourth Amendment violation must be “egregious” for evidence to be thrown out. Moreover, thanks to a more recent case called Gutierrez-Berdin v. Eric Holder, even “very minor physical abuse coupled with aggressive questioning” does not rise to the level of an egregious Fourth Amendment violation. The government’s rationale here is beautiful in its simplicity. American criminals have constitutional rights not because they are natural-born Americans but precisely because they are criminals. Deportations, however, are not part of the criminal justice system. “Removal proceedings,” wrote the circuit judge in the Gutierrez-Berdin case, “are civil, not criminal, and the exclusionary rule does not generally apply to them.”",

It used to be that citizenship in a strong and healthy state was universally prized, because citizenship confers rights. But with citizenship also comes responsibilities, and it turns out that not everybody wants those. In the minds of some, if you can get the rights without the responsibilities, you’re really onto something. In other words, there’s a new class of people whose goal is to become above citizenship.

But so many people may be clamoring to short a certain stock that the number of shares available for borrowing may not be sufficient to meet the demand. In that case (and it can happen for other reasons as well), a stock becomes “hard to borrow,” and the cost to borrow a single share for any length of time can become exorbitant. Short sellers talk about the price of “the borrow” when they figure their costs. And in the case of Fairfax, the borrow was through the roof. Between 2003 and 2006, the cost to borrow Fairfax stock skyrocketed, to the point where a short seller had to pay a surcharge of 30 percent or more just to borrow a share.",

People get hurt, sure, but the victims are mostly sophisticated investors who should know better, and it’s not like you’re hitting them in the head with a brick or anything. It’s not a real crime. At least it doesn’t look like one. That may once have been true. But in the Fairfax case, the principals in this “victimless” scheme started to mimic the gangster aesthetic. Like most privileged, overeducated Americans who try it, they would suck at being real tough guys. They tried, however, and here’s the crazy thing: in a city where police in some neighborhoods define crime as standing on the sidewalk the wrong way, these idiots took their stock-trading act-like-a-thug life, screwed it up a hundred different ways, and not only couldn’t get arrested, they couldn’t even get police of any kind to notice.",

One of the favorite targets of that fraud scheme was government and the taxpayer. These companies, along with their bankers, loved more than anything to sell worthless mortgage bonds to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-backed housing agencies. Just one Southern Californian company, Countrywide, dumped as much as $26.6 billion on the taxpayer and the state when it sold overvalued bonds to Fannie and Freddie. Bank of America, its eventual parent company, sold another $6 billion to Fannie and Freddie. Fifteen other companies also targeted the federal government for hundreds of millions and billions more. The state of California’s pension fund, CalPERS, was also the target of massive fraud schemes, as banks, mortgage lenders, and ratings agencies conspired to sell California workers billions more in worthless securities in exchange for their life savings.",

But despite having been warned about the possibility of widespread mortgage fraud by the FBI as early as 2004, financial cops in regulatory agencies like the SEC and the OCC didn’t respond to the problem at all until well after the crash. When they finally did respond, they did so by bringing civil suits against companies like Countrywide, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wachovia, TD Ameritrade, Goldman Sachs, Charles Schwab, and others. In the twenty-one biggest federal settlements over mortgage fraud abuses—$300 million from State Street for lying to investors, $153 million from Chase in the Magnetar settlement, and so on—those companies and a few others paid a total of $26 billion in damages to the government. In every single one of those cases, the relevant companies were allowed to settle without admitting wrongdoing. Not a single individual was charged in any of those cases. Not a single individual had to pay so much as a dime of his own money in damages.",

There’s a cultural spectrum these bureaucracies are attuned to that roughly ranges from black poverty to white wealth. Where you are on that spectrum determines how much of a citizen you get to be. Things that are jailable crimes on one end of that spectrum become speeding tickets on the other. We find white people on the jail end and black people on the speeding ticket end, but for the most part … well, for the most part, you know what I mean. That winking understanding we all share about who gets the book thrown at him and who doesn’t, that’s where American racism has gone: unspoken and hidden, but bureaucratized and automated, and therefore more powerful than ever.",

And Clinton’s vacillating but cleverly packaged campaign to “end welfare as we know it” was a brilliant ploy by the man Toni Morrison called the “first black president” to take back the southern white voters the Democrats had seemingly lost forever when they sent the FBI into Alabama and Mississippi in the 1960s.

Less commonly understood is that Clinton, Greenspan, Rubin, and Summers also oversaw the collapse of what are known as “selective credit controls,” the tools used to rein in irresponsible lending.

It simply wasn’t economical for companies to devote any resources at all to chasing after a thousand dollars here and there. But as time passed, and the machinery of collections became more streamlined and brutal, we reached the current state of affairs. Now a Chase bank executive can sit in an office in San Antonio and with a few brief keystrokes transfer the right to seize the salary and automobile of a stranger in Chicago or Newark to some random company in Louisiana. At one point in time that process also required significant legal due diligence and the transfer of documentation, but executives soon realized that in the overwhelmed modern court system, simply attesting to having the right documentation works just as well as really having it. This is the same realization that struck Bank of America when it found that saying it had foreclosure documents was almost as good as having them—and the same one that touched process servers at American Legal Process, who found that claiming to have delivered a summons was almost as good as (and certainly cheaper than) actually doing it.",

		"Content": "Most people, when they hear the term “bailouts,” think of the Troubled Asset Relief Program, called TARP. And when people think of TARP, they reflexively remember hearing that the banks that borrowed billions from that program have all paid their money back. So—no harm, no foul. It’s not like we gave them the money. Thus while it is true, for instance, that Linda Almonte’s employer, JPMorgan Chase, accepted $25 billion through the TARP program and used that money to buy not only Washington Mutual (for a state-struck pennies-on-the-dollar price) but a pair of $60 million Gulfstream jets and an $18 million hangar facility in Westchester County, that’s all okay because, well, Chase paid the money back a year later. So it’s not like it came out of our pockets. Less well known is that Chase was extended billions more in guarantees to help buy the corpse of Bear Stearns. It was allowed to borrow $33 billion more against the state’s credit card—if it defaulted on those loans, we’d have picked up the bill—through an even more obscure Federal Reserve program called the Temporary…",

From there, it’s not long before the tail starts wagging the dog. A massive, unconscious tendency toward reverse profiling occurs.

Just trying to do the right thing legitimizes the entire system. We don’t do it often enough.",

Jahns watched the girl, who was unmoved save her eyes as they darted over the colorful pages. The girl never looked up to see who was passing the apartment floor’s landing. They left her behind, and she gradually faded in the darkness as Jahns and Marnes struggled ever upward, exhausted from their third day of climbing, no vibrations or ringing footsteps above or below them, the silo quiet and eerily devoid of life, room enough for two old friends, two comrades, to walk side by side on the steps of chipping paint, their arms swinging and every now and then, very occasionally, brushing together.",

To top it all off, Theranos had drawn the blood of the president of Walgreens’s pharmacy business, one of the company’s most senior executives, and failed to give him a test result! Van den Hooff listened with a pained look on his face. “We can’t not pursue this,” he said. “We can’t risk a scenario where CVS has a deal with them in six months and it ends up being real.” Walgreens’s rivalry with CVS, which was based in Rhode Island and one-third bigger in terms of revenues, colored virtually everything the drugstore chain did. It was a myopic view of the world that was hard to understand for an outsider like Hunter who wasn’t a Walgreens company man. Theranos had cleverly played on this insecurity. As a result, Walgreens suffered from a severe case of FoMO—the fear of missing out.",

The companies understood, and they persuaded Republican senators, that the principle of consent would strike a serious blow to the foundational mechanisms of the new capitalism: the legitimacy of unilateral surplus dispossession, ownership rights to surplus, decision rights over surplus, and the right to lawless space for the prosecution of these activities.146 To this end the resolution also prevented the FCC from seeking to establish similar protections in the future.",

We designed social networks without any way of dealing with abuse or harassment. We designed a financial incentives system that would lead Mark Zuckerberg to assert what’s good for the world isn’t necessarily good for Facebook; and lead Jack Dorsey to believe engagement was a more important metric than safety. Either by action or inaction, through fault or ignorance, we have designed the world to behave exactly as it’s behaving right now. These are our chickens coming home to roost.",

From his pulpit in the New Yorker, he has periodically held forth on how unwise it is to attempt to have climate change abated. Like Scranton, he believes that ‘planetary overheating is a done deal’. As his evidence, he points to the fact that ‘no head of state has ever made a commitment to leaving any carbon in the ground’. Before the 1790s, no head of a state had ever made a commitment to freeing African slaves; in July 1791, someone of Franzen’s disposition could have argued, on these grounds alone, that eternal slavery is a done deal.",

While some climate fatalists deny that it would be logically and technically possible to cut emissions to zero and then begin the work of repair and regeneration, more common is the argument that this just won’t happen, because of the way the world is. Scranton at one point acknowledges that it could be accomplished, if we managed to ‘radically reorient all human economic and social production, a task that is scarcely imaginable, much less feasible. It would demand centralized control of key economic sectors, massive state investment in carbon capture and sequestration, and global coordination on a scale never seen before’ – a scenario that can be conjured up in some theoretical hemisphere of the mind but not promoted or implemented in the real world, because the forces stacked against it are so stupefyingly strong. Despair about the climate is here based on a judgement of extreme improbability, hypostatised into impossibility. The procedure is anti-political through and through.",

Another was that even when you might have thought that problem was solved, it wasn’t. Two years after Joe and his postdocs published their findings on Balamuthia, the FDA had yet to approve Nitroxoline, long since cleared by European regulators, as a treatment. The CDC website continued to recommend an old treatment (another one of the 2,177 drugs) that the DeRisi Lab had demonstrated did nothing but create unpleasant side effects.",

And the Biohub put out an APB for volunteers. What happened next would have astonished lots of people, but not Joe. A small army of graduate students and postdocs, mostly from UCSF, rushed to help. “They came in droves,” said Joe. “And it was always, How can I help? How do I do this? No one asked to be paid.”",

If Bank B agrees, Bank A can then go to the Basel regulators and say, “Hey, we’re insured if something goes wrong with our IBM holdings. So don’t count that as money we have at risk. Let us lend a higher percentage of our capital, now that we’re insured.” It’s a win-win. Bank B makes, basically, a free $250,000.

How do you make money off that knowledge? First, you call up a securities lender, someone like, say, Win Neuger, and ask if he has any stock in International Pimple. He says he does, as much as you want. You then borrow a thousand shares of International Pimple from Neuger, which let’s say is trading at 10 that day. So that’s $10,000 worth of stock. Now, in order to “borrow” those shares from Neuger, you have to give him collateral for those shares in the form of cash. For his trouble, you have to pay him a slight markup, usually 1–2 percent of the real value. So perhaps instead of sending $10,000 to Neuger, you send him $10,200. Now you take those thousand shares of International Pimple, you go out onto the market, and you sell them. Now you’ve got $10,000 in cash again. Then, you wait for the stock to decline in value. So let’s say a month later, International Pimple is now trading not at 10 but at 7½. You then go out and buy a thousand shares in the company for $7,500. Then you go back to Win Neuger and return his borrowed shares to him; he returns your $10,000 and takes the stock back. You’ve now made $2,500 on the decline in value of International Pimple, less the $200 fee that Neuger keeps. That’s how short selling works,",

How they accomplished that feat was somewhat complicated. First, the Fed put up the money to cover the collateral calls against Neuger from Goldman and other banks. Then the Fed set up a special bailout facility called Maiden Lane II (named after the tiny street in downtown Manhattan next to the New York Federal Reserve Bank), which it then used to systematically buy up all the horseshit RMBS assets Neuger and his moronic “ten cubed”–chasing employees had bought up with all their billions in collateral over the years.",

We paid for this instead of a generation of health insurance, or an alternative energy grid, or a brand-new system of roads and highways. With the $13-plus trillion we are estimated to ultimately spend on the bailouts, we could not only have bought and paid off every single subprime mortgage in the country (that would only have cost $1.4 trillion), we could have paid off every remaining mortgage of any kind in this country—and still have had enough money left over to buy a new house for every American who does not already have one. But we didn’t do that, and we didn’t spend the money on anything else useful, either. Why? For a very good reason. Because we’re no good anymore at building bridges and highways or coming up with brilliant innovations in energy or medicine. We’re shit now at finishing massive public works projects or launching brilliant fairy-tale public policy ventures like the moon landing. What are we good at? Robbing what’s left. When it comes to that, we Americans have no peer. And when it came time to design the bailouts, a monster collective project spanning two presidential administrations that was every bit as vast and far-reaching (only not into the future, but the past) as Kennedy’s trip to the moon, we showed it.",

No soap. “We explained it, said, you know, we would have killed the guy if we’d operated. But their physician’s assistant upheld the denial,” Eileen Popola, the hospital’s case manager later explained.",

It denied repayment in one case involving a patient who had come in to the hospital and received IV antibiotics; the grounds were that the patient had been a nurse twenty years earlier and should have been able to administer that care herself, in her own home. “I guess if your father’s a surgeon and your mother’s an anesthesiologist, lie down on the kitchen table and get your heart fixed there,” Kane quipped.",

Without a way to test for superior ability, identifying it in students was haphazard and unscientific, and so was public education in general. If intellectual capacity were a single genetic trait—and they believed it was—then it should be testable. Terman set about making it so, adapting a French intelligence test used to identify students who were falling behind. Against the explicit warning of the test’s author, Alfred Binet, Terman and his Stanford team reformatted it into a measure of inborn general intelligence, expressed in a single number, the ratio of “mental age” to actual age multiplied by 100.10 From there Terman and company were off to the races, marketing “Stanford-Binet” tests, estimating the IQs of famous dead people, and looking for geniuses.",

Hoover’s private associates were up and down the project, especially the Southern California Edison chairman Henry Robinson, to whose firm Secretary Wilbur originally appropriated 25 percent (!) of the Hoover Dam power output, before criticism forced him to reduce it to 9 percent.16 Harry Chandler—conservative publisher of the Los Angeles Times, Stanford dad, and Hoover’s confederate on the university board—became the city’s most important capitalist by riding the Hoover real estate and manufacturing boom into the 1930s. These men poured the concrete foundation for what was shaping up to be California’s century.",

American military intelligence tracked Mexican communists through the CAWIU, singling out men such as Frank Samora (union secretary), Francisco Medina (chapter founder), and Fred Martínez (YCL organizer).40 Behind them were the Chicana-led networks that ensured the strikers lived to see another day, financing the effort with sweat and discipline. Prominent radical Filipino labor organizers such as Carlos Bulosan and Larry Itliong cut their teeth in the same California 1930s farmwork milieu. The planters’ depiction of the CAWIU as Mexican and Filipino workers misled by communists is belied by the obvious fact that a handful of underfunded outside agitators couldn’t possibly have organized California’s Spanish- and Tagalog-speaking agricultural workers the way the CAWIU did. Rather, Party organizers like Darcy and Decker eschewed the top-down turn in Moscow and fit themselves to the diverse rank-and-file tradition of California communism.",

He figured that atomic bombs were 10 to 100 times as efficient. “This cheapness is a new factor and indicates that an unparalleled loss of human resources will accompany future wars.” Following the idea to its logical conclusion, he writes, “leads to the picture of one man being able to unleash forces which would destroy the world.” Still, he concludes with that big number: Given 100x efficiency, 500, maybe 600 man-months are destroyed for every one spent. At that ratio, you could rule the world with a button.",

WE MUST EVACUATE, he telegraphed to the funeral of San Francisco labor legend Tom Mooney in 1942 after racist restrictions prohibited his attendance, BUT WHEREVER WE GO WE WILL CONTINUE TO FIGHT THE FASCISTS.30 The LAPD Red Squads targeted Japanese antiwar protesters as they staged a sympathy demonstration outside the Chinese consulate.

SAGE stations had computers that connected across the country by modem and telephone line, a first. The system was a PR coup for IBM, which produced a 12-minute advertising video called “On Guard! The Story of SAGE,” a truly exceptional piece of Cold War propaganda, complete with Mom and Dad standing watch over their sleeping daughter: the parental dyad, a SAGE system of the home.xx According to SAGE engineer Lester Earnest, it also didn’t work—at all.xxi No one claims America ever used SAGE in action, but Earnest maintains that we never could have. He compares the system to Forrest Gump: “It was very fast, financially successful, and incredibly stupid.”65 For one thing, SAGE couldn’t handle radar countermeasures, which the Soviets were already using. For another, ICBMs replaced bombers as the go-to nuclear delivery device, and those went above radar into space. At best SAGE was a glorified air-traffic control system; at worst it connected nuclear missiles to buggy code and unsecured phone lines.xxii",

That’s not what happened. Instead, the Democrats stuck with the Dixiecrats, turning their nose up at the sacrifices in Mississippi. When Mississippi organizer Fannie Lou Hamer appeared on the television broadcast to testify about her struggles to register to vote, the president intervened to get the camera off of her.

		"Content": "a fable that capitalists adopted from the Stanford eco-racist anti-population milieu: the “tragedy of the commons.” In six pages published in the journal Science in December of 1968, the Stanford-trained ecologist Garrett Hardin asserted that the public “commons” was by its nature subject to abuse by maximizing actors. A bigot and cofounder of the anti-immigrant group FAIR, Hardin was worried about population specifically. “In a welfare state,” he begs the question, “how shall we deal with the family, the religion, the race, or the class (or indeed any distinguishable and cohesive group) that adopts overbreeding as a policy to secure its own aggrandizement?”18 One step away from neo-Nazism, this rhetoric wore the cloak of environmentalism during the Nixon years, but by the time of the Reagan administration, the musing philosophy paper that had no business in a scientific publication in the first place had ballooned to an existential truth that applied to public goods in general. As the economy advanced, the state had to “enclose” an increasing number of commons to make sure they weren’t misused, either by overexploitation or, just as concerning, underexploitation, since, as we know, capital is reluctant to enter new markets where it can’t protect its initial position. This represented a change in the ideology, from recognizing the need to build up an intellectual-property commons for new industries to creating the best investment climate possible by constraining the spread of new tech.",

Companies opened their own proprietary training institutes, in which they got to tailor the curriculum and charge tuition.viii The next Bobby Seale could train for a tech or an aerospace job, as Seale first intended, without running into political distractions. Free of public control, these schools only taught skills for which there was a private demand, ensuring the best use of the country’s human capital, according to the market’s transindividual superintelligence. Apparently the market approved, launching DeVry stock from $10 to $24 a share on its first day of public trading in 1991.30 Now capitalists could not only get their workers to train themselves, they could also make them pay for the privilege.

Low-capital, labor-intensive businesses such as restaurants, doughnut bakeries, small groceries, auto-repair garages, newsstands, motels, nail salons, liquor shops, and convenience stores were viable enough, but small profit margins meant that self- and family exploitation was the only way to make any money. Ronald Takaki calls it an “opportune moment” to become a shopkeeper, and yet he also notes that a “study of Korean business owners showed that more than 90 percent of them worked harder and lived more frugally here than they had in Korea.”",

As opposed to Joseph Conrad’s nightmarish vision of the corruption of the white man who journeys into the heart of African darkness, Conrad’s contemporary, the Hebrew writer Moshe Smilansky, presented Jewish contact with the Bedouin and Druze of Palestine as literally an ennobling experience.",

Precisely because they were believed to be true Orientals, however, Yemenite Jews were also perceived as “natural laborers” who could compete successfully with Arabs, performing backbreaking agricultural work at low wages. (With this goal in mind, in 1912 the ZO’s Palestine Office recruited Yemenite Jews to immigrate to Palestine; a contingent of them labored on the lands of the Kinneret training farm, only to be summarily expelled in 1930 when the land was needed for new immigrants from eastern Europe.20)",

		"Content": "Stoler’s description of French and Dutch policies and attitudes toward their colonial subjects can be easily mapped onto attitudes and policies toward Jews in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Europe. Emancipation was granted on a quid pro quo basis. Cultural and economic regeneration—that is, mastery of the host society’s language, the adoption of reigning cultural mores, and a movement from the traditional practice of peddling to livelihoods in crafts and agriculture—were considered either preconditions for citizenship (as in the German states) or immediate and necessary outcomes of the attainment of citizenship (as in France). For Jews in post-Napoleonic Prussian Poland, as for Indo-Europeans in colonial southeast Asia, citizenship was granted on a case-by-case basis, the result of a rigorous yet arbitrary examination procedure. Proposals made in the late nineteenth century by colonial officials to establish agricultural colonies for the regeneration of the Indo-European poor had their parallel in the era of enlightened absolutism, when reformist bureaucrats in Prussia, Austria, and Russia championed, and at times established, colonies to train Jews in productive labor.",

The material conditions of life for European Jews and Asians differed greatly, as did the relations of power with the European hegemonic powers, but the thought processes of Jewish and Asian intellectuals were similar, including those that led to the development of nationalist ideologies. It is no surprise, then, that aspects of Zionism resemble anticolonial national movements, although there were spectacular differences as well.",

		"Content": "Consider the case of women’s suffrage, which was the subject of almost two centuries of debate in the West and which only came to France and Switzerland after World War II. As Sylvia Walby has noted, many postcolonial states have granted women the franchise at the time of the states’ establishment. Political citizenship is granted to all adults at the time of state creation as an expression of a populist sentiment and a legitimization of the overthrow of nonrepresentative colonial rule. As Chatterjee writes of India, nationalists asserted that the entire people had been nationalized, that is, vested with a distinct and unifying Indianness. The nation, having been feminized by the colonial power, was to be emancipated in one fell swoop.36 This conceptual framework is of benefit for the study of Zionism, for it helps account for the ZO’s early granting of voting rights to women (at the Second Congress of 1898, at time when only New Zealand had national female suffrage) and the passion with which all but ultra-Orthodox members of the Yishuv advocated women’s suffrage after World War I.",

After a few visits, she gave me an extensive test of over 500 questions called an MMPI, which stands for the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory. The creators of this test designed it to give a therapist a fairly accurate breakdown of a person’s personality. If questions are answered truthfully, it can tell a lot about a person, including their gender identity. However, the questions on the test relating to gender identity are so blatantly obvious that a person could easily manipulate their answers to show the identity they want the therapist to see. I have heard of that happening, so I don’t personally hold much stock in the test’s validity in that area.",

A union in any state can provide you with a bit more protection than you would otherwise have without one.

		"Content": "The all-American superhero reflected many of the beliefs and values of Jewish immigrants of the day. Like them, Superman had come to America from a foreign world. Like them, he longed to fit in to his strange new surroundings. Superman also seemed to embody the Jewish principle of tzedakah—a command to serve the less fortunate and to stand up for the weak and exploited—and the concept of tikkun olam, the mandate to do good works (literally, to “repair a broken world”). Even the language of Superman had Jewish origins. Before Superman is blasted off the dying planet of Krypton, Superman’s father, Jor-El, names his son Kal-El. In ancient Hebrew the suffix El means “all that is God.”",

The process itself should not be overly arduous, if you follow this simple protocol: List all of the requisite content pages (blog posts, articles, product detail pages, etc.). Create top-level navigation that can comfortably hold all of the unique types of detailed content on the site. Reverse the traditional top-down process by starting with the detailed content and working your way up to an organizational structure capable of holding each page. Once you understand the bottom, fill in the middle. Build out a structure for subnavigation to sensibly connect top-level pages with detailed content. In small sites, there may be no need for this level, whereas in larger sites, two or even three levels of subnavigation may be required. Include secondary pages such as copyright, contact information, and other nonessentials. Build a visual hierarchy that shows (to at least the last level of subnavigation) each page on the site. Figure 6-7 shows an example of a structured site architecture.",
