But little was known of Q's mysterious past or of the unearthly realm from which he hails. </p><p> Until now. </p><p> A brilliant scientist may have found a way to breach the energy barrier surrounding the Milky Way galaxy, and the <i>Enterprise</i> is going to put it to the test. The last thing Captain Picard needs is a surprise visit from Q, but the omnipotent trickster has more in mind than his usual pranks. Kidnapping Picard, he takes the captain back through time to the moment the Q Continuum faced its greatest threat. </p><p> Now Picard must learn Q's secrets -- or all of reality may perish!</p>",
