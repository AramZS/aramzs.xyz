                "description": "Humanity has colonized the solar system - Mars, the Moon, the Asteroid Belt and beyond - but the stars are still out of our reach.<br /><br />Jim Holden is XO of an ice miner making runs from the rings of Saturn to the mining stations of the Belt. When he and his crew stumble upon a derelict ship, the <i>Scopuli</i>, they find themselves in possession of a secret they never wanted. A secret that someone is willing to kill for - and kill on a scale unfathomable to Jim and his crew. War is brewing in the system unless he can find out who left the ship and why.<br /><br />Detective Miller is looking for a girl. One girl in a system of billions, but her parents have money and money talks. When the trail leads him to the <i>Scopuli</i> and rebel sympathizer Holden, he realizes that this girl may be the key to everything.<br /><br />Holden and Miller must thread the needle between the Earth government, the Outer Planet revolutionaries, and secretive corporations - and the odds are against them. But out in the Belt, the rules are different, and one small ship can change the fate of the universe.",
