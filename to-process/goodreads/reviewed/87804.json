                "description": "Recently single, Danny Wallace was falling into loneliness and isolation. When a stranger on a bus advises, \"Say yes more,\" Wallace vows to say yes to every offer, invitation, challenge, and chance.<br /><br />In Yes Man, Wallace recounts his months-long commitment to complete openness with profound insight and humbling honesty. Saying yes takes Wallace into a new plane of existence: a place where money comes as easily as it goes, nodding a lot can lead to a long weekend overseas with new friends, and romance isn't as complicated as it seems. Yes eventually leads to the biggest question of all: \"Do you, Danny Wallace, take this woman . . .\"<br /><br />Yes Man is inspiring proof that a little willingness can take anyone to the most wonderful of places.",
