                "description": "<b>A collection of essays and other non fiction from Terry Pratchett, spanning the whole of his writing career from his early years to the present day.</b> <br />     Terry Pratchett has earned a place in the hearts of readers the world over with his bestselling Discworld series -- but in recent years he has become equally well-known and respected as an outspoken campaigner for causes including Alzheimer's research and animal rights. <i>A Slip of the Keyboard </i>brings together for the first time the finest examples of Pratchett's non fiction writing, both serious and surreal: from musings on mushrooms to what it means to be a writer (and why banana daiquiris are so important); from memories of Granny Pratchett to speculation about Gandalf's love life, and passionate defences of the causes dear to him.<br />     With all the humour and humanity that have made his novels so enduringly popular, this collection brings Pratchett out from behind the scenes of the Discworld to speak for himself -- man and boy, bibliophile and computer geek, champion of hats, orangutans and Dignity in Dying.<br /><br />   <i>Snuff </i>was the bestselling adult hardcover novel of 2011. <i>A Blink of the Screen</i>, Terry's short fiction collection, was also one of the bestselling hardcovers of 2012.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>",
