                "description": "<b>Winner of Fourteen <u>Eisner</u> Awards</b><br /><br /><b>The best-laid plans.</b><br />The free Fables living in the mundane world have struck a decisive blow against the Adversary, destroying one of his most valuable assets at the very heart of his empire - and setting the stage for an all-out war between the worlds in the process. Now, while the ruler of the Homelands licks his wounds and gathers his forces, the denizens of Fabletown have a rare chance to savor the brief peace their victory has brought them. Everyone, however, knows that this is just the calm before the storm - and that even the winds themselves will have to choose sides before it's over.<br /><br /><b>Collecting</b>: <i>Fables</i> 52-59",
