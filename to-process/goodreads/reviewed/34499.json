Now magically, he's turned up again, and this time he's brought the Luggage.<br /><br />But that's not all....<br /><br />Once upon a time, there was an eighth son of an eighth son who was, of course, a wizard. As if that wasn't complicated enough, said wizard then had seven sons. And then he had an eighth son -- a wizard squared (that's all the math, really). Who of course, was a source of magic -- a sourcerer.",
