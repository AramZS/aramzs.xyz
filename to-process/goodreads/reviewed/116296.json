But, as former con-man Moist von Lipwig is learning, the life is not necessarily for long.<br /><br />The Chief Cashier is almost certainly a vampire. There's something nameless in the cellar (and the cellar itself is pretty nameless), it turns out that the Royal Mint runs at a loss. A 300 year old wizard is after his girlfriend, he's about to be exposed as a fraud, but the Assassins Guild might get him first. In fact lot of people want him dead<br /><br />Oh. And every day he has to take the Chairman for walkies.<br /><br />Everywhere he looks he's making enemies.<br /><br />What he should be doing is . . . Making Money!",
