                "description": "Days before his release from prison, Shadow's wife, Laura, dies in a mysterious car crash. Numbly, he makes his way back home. On the plane, he encounters the enigmatic Mr Wednesday, who claims to be a refugee from a distant war, a former god and the king of America.<br /> <br />Together they embark on a profoundly strange journey across the heart of the USA, whilst all around them a storm of preternatural and epic proportions threatens to break.<br /><br />Scary, gripping and deeply unsettling, <i>American Gods</i> takes a long, hard look into the soul of America. You'll be surprised by what - and who - it finds there...<br /><br /><i>This is the author's preferred text, never before published in the UK, and is about 12,000 words longer than the previous UK edition.</i><br /><br />",
