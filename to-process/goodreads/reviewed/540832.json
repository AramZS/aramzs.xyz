                "description": "This first novel in a magnificent new fantasy series draws upon the rich legends, cultures, and traditions of the East to create an epic tale of kingdoms invaded, nobles enslaved, and a young man's desperate quest to find his family and to face the challenge of a destiny which may be beyond any mortal's power to fulfill....<br /><br />Llesho was seven when the Harn invade his family's mountain kingdom of Thebin. Sold into slavery on Pearl Island, he was, as far as he knew, the sole survivor of his royal family.<br /><br />When Llesho was ten, the old man called Lleck secretly began to undertake the boy's education. But when Llesho was fifteen, Lleck died, and his spirit visited the boy while he worked the pearl beds, revealing his true destiny to him. All six of his older brothers were still alive! Llesho must win his freedom, find and rescue his brothers, and with their help raise an army against the evil Harn.<br /><br />As a pearl diver he would never be allowed off the island. So Llesho petitioned his lord to be trained as a gladiator, thus taking the first step on a road that would lead to conflicts with sorcerers, encounters with the avatars of gods, and a dangerous journey in search of the widely scattered family he had never expected to see again....",
