Each one enters into the life of a different person living in contemporary New York. <br /><br />Here he links forces with the defiant young Eddie Dean and the beautiful, brilliant, and brave Odetta Holmes, in a savage struggle against underworld evil and otherworldly enemies.<br /><br />Once again, Stephen King has masterfully interwoven dark, evocative fantasy and icy realism.",
