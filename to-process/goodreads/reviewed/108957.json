                "description": "Ubiquitous computing--almost imperceptible, but everywhere around us--is rapidly becoming a reality. How will it change us? how can we shape its emergence? Smart buildings, smart furniture, smart clothing... even smart bathtubs. networked street signs and self-describing soda cans. Gestural interfaces like those seen in <i>Minority Report</i>. The RFID tags now embedded in everything from credit cards to the family pet. All of these are facets of the ubiquitous computing author Adam Greenfield calls \"everyware.\" In a series of brief, thoughtful meditations, Greenfield explains how everyware is already reshaping our lives, transforming our understanding of the cities we live in, the communities we belong to--and the way we see ourselves. What are people saying about the book? <i>\"Adam Greenfield is intense, engaged, intelligent and caring. I pay attention to him. I counsel you to do the same.\" </i>--<b>HOWARD RHEINGOLD</b>, AUTHOR, <i>SMART MOBS: THE NEXT SOCIAL REVOLUTION</i> <i>\"A gracefully written, fascinating, and deeply wise book on one of the most powerful ideas of the digital age--and the obstacles we must overcome before we can make ubiquitous computing a reality.\"</i>--<b>STEVE SILBERMAN</b>, EDITOR, <i>WIRED MAGAZINE</i> <i>\"Adam is a visionary. he has true compassion and respect for ordinary users like me who are struggling to use and understand the new technology being thrust on us at overwhelming speed.\"</i>--<b>REBECCA MACKINNON</b>, BERKMAN CENTER FOR INTERNET AND SOCIETY, HARVARD UNIVERSITY <i>Everyware</i> is an AIGA Design Press book, published under Peachpit's New Riders imprint in partnership with AIGA.<br />",
