But now he's getting more than he bargained for:<br /><br />A duel with the Red Court of Vampires' champion, who must kill Harry to end the war between vampires and wizards...<br /><br />Professional hit men using Harry for target practice...<br /><br />The missing Shroud of Turin...<br /><br />A handless and headless corpse the Chicago police need identified...<br /><br />Not to mention the return of Harry's ex-girlfriend Susan, who's still struggling with her semi-vampiric nature. And who seems to have a new man in her life.<br /><br />Some days, it just doesn't pay to get out of bed. No matter how much you're charging.",
