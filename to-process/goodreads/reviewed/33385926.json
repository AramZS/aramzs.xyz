That’s just one of the things that makes this a very modern Marvel team-up, as the two most sensational web-spinners of the 21st century cross paths — and lock lips! Miles Morales and Gwen Stacy are two young heroes from different Earths, but what threat could unite the Spider-Man and Spider-Woman of the new generation? The answer will rock both their worlds! Not for the first time, Miles will find himself in another universe — and he’s in pursuit of someone he holds dear. But will that description soon apply to Gwen? Or, as the stakes are raised, will this spider-crossed pair see teen romance give way to arachnid animosity? First comes love, then comes much worse, then comes chaos in the Multiverse!<br /><br /><b>Collecting:</b> SPIDER-MAN (2016) #12-14 and SPIDER-GWEN (2015B) #16-18.",
