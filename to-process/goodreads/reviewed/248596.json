                "description": "One of Ray Bradbury’s best-known and most popular novels, <i>Something Wicked This Way Comes</i>, now featuring a new introduction and material about its longstanding influence on culture and genre.<br /><br />For those who still dream and remember, for those yet to experience the hypnotic power of its dark poetry, step inside. The show is about to begin. Cooger &amp; Dark’s Pandemonium Shadow Show has come to Green Town, Illinois, to destroy every life touched by its strange and sinister mystery. The carnival rolls in sometime after midnight, ushering in Halloween a week early. A calliope’s shrill siren song beckons to all with a seductive promise of dreams and youth regained. Two boys will discover the secret of its smoke, mazes, and mirrors; two friends who will soon know all too well the heavy cost of wishes…and the stuff of nightmares.<br /><br />Few novels have endured in the heart and memory as has Ray Bradbury’s unparalleled literary masterpiece <i>Something Wicked This Way Comes</i>. Scary and suspenseful, it is a timeless classic in the American canon.",
