His landmark achievement in the medium is his acclaimed run on STARMAN, which <i>Entertainment Weekly</i> described as “the best written super-hero in comics.”<br /><br />Now Robinson's defining run on WildC.A.T.s is collected into a single volume, collecting his 1990s issues, which feature the impressive art of Travis Charest and other fine artists who provide breathtaking visuals. <br /><br />Robinson takes over the reins as writer of WildStorm's flagship super hero team from comics legend Alan Moore (WATCHMEN, V FOR VENDETTA) and continues the amazing adventures of the WILDC.A.T.S while stirring up the WildStorm Universe.",
