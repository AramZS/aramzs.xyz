Now help is here, and consultants, independent contractors, the self-employed, “solopreneurs,” and everyone else living a freelancer’s life will never be alone again but instead can be part of a strong and vibrant community.<br /><br />Written by the authority on freelance working, Sara Horowitz, MacArthur “Genius” Fellow and founder of the national Freelancers Union and, most recently, the Freelancers Insurance Company, <i>The Freelancer’s Bible</i> will help those new to freelancing learn the ropes, and will help those who’ve been freelancing for a while grow and expand.
