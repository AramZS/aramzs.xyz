                "description": "The Offworld Collection features a tremendously diverse roster of contributors, writing about everything from the fascinating world of women's pinball, to the lingo of Chinese games culture, to the small, intimate games that explore how young adults deal with sex and technology. It's a book for anyone with a passion for design, play and criticism.<br /><br />When editors Leigh Alexander and Laura Hudson relaunched Offworld, our goal was to build a website that focused on the writing and game design work of women, people of color and other marginalized folks. We wanted to create a space that actively welcomed perspectives that are often ignored by mainstream game culture, a place where where we could share our expertise and insight into the art of game creation and the culture of play. After a year of publishing incredible content from an all-star roster of writers, we're publishing a book collection.<br /><br /><b>Contents</b><br /><br />Introduction<br />Leigh Alexander<br /><br />We are not colonists<br />Gita Jackson<br /><br />Women take a place at the pinball table<br />Laura Hudson<br /><br />The divine witches of cyberspace<br />Leigh Alexander<br /><br />No girl wins: why women unlearn their love of video games<br />Juliet Kahn<br /><br />Playing on ‘Indian time’<br />Daniel Starkey<br /><br />Altgames, a punk movement<br />Zoe Quinn<br /><br />All the women I know in video games are tired<br />Leigh Alexander<br /><br />In Bloodborne’s brutal world, I found myself<br />Laura Hudson<br /><br />How to make a truly democratic game design tool<br />Anna Anthropy<br /><br />You have 20 minutes before the sun blows up<br />Laura Hudson<br /><br />How to play as a spiritual hole<br />Leigh Alexander<br /><br />In fantasy worlds, historical accuracy is a lie<br />Tanya DePass<br /><br />The many inglorious deaths of my virtual fish<br />Leigh Alexander<br /><br />The existential dread of fighting games<br />Maddy Myers<br /><br />I’ve been texting with an astronaut<br />Laura Hudson<br /><br />This moving game about gravity will catch you<br />Katherine Cross<br /><br />What a car is to a girl<br />Leigh Alexander<br /><br />The vast, unplayable history of video games<br />Gita Jackson<br /><br />Piracy gave me a future<br />Daniel Starkey<br /><br />Astonishing comics that ‘save your game’ when you turn the page<br />Laura Hudson<br /><br />And maybe they won’t kill you<br />Leigh Alexander<br /><br />How hip hop can teach you to code<br />Shareef Jackson<br /><br />War without tears<br />Maxwell Neely-Cohen<br /><br />Should you kill monsters, or empthaize with them?<br />Laura Hudson<br /><br />On being a strange, brilliant clown<br />Leigh Alexander<br /><br />Edutainment failed me<br />Aroon Karuna<br /><br />Subversive games about waitresses and hairdressers<br />Laura Hudson<br /><br />The queer masculinity of stealth games<br />Riley MacLeod<br /><br />Meet the secret new horror mistress of video games<br />Leigh Alexander<br /><br />I love my untouchable virtual body<br />Aevee Bee<br /><br />The millennials are just fine, and so are their sex games<br />Laura Hudson<br /><br />The clone that wasn’t<br />Leigh Alexander<br /><br />China loves the lingo of games<br />Christina Xu<br /><br />Remembering Syberia, an adventure game about a woman finding herself<br />Katherine Cross<br /><br />Why Final Fantasy VII matters<br />Leigh Alexander<br /><br />Black characters in video games must be more than inhuman stereotypes<br />Sidney Fussell<br /><br />The poetry in game-making<br />Katriel Paige<br /><br />How card games became cool again<br />By Kim Nguyen<br /><br />The Beginner’s Guide is a game that doesn’t want to be written about<br />Laura Hudson<br /><br />Castlevania: Symphony of the Night is forever<br />Leigh Alexander<br /><br />My games are tools of healing and community<br />Soha Kareem<br /><br />The other side of Braid<br />Liz Ryerson<br /><br />Interactive movies make their glorious return<br />Leigh Alexander<br /><br />How should we talk about Final Fantasy VII’s crossdressing sequence?<br />Sarah Nyberg<br /><br />A brilliant murder mystery you solve with a search engine<br />Laura Hudson<br /><br />Edgy sex games highlight intimacy, not conquest<br />Merritt Kopas<br /><br />Creating a spectrum of feelings with only four keys<br />Leigh Alexander<br /><br />How we developed a black woman protagonist who mattered<br />Catt Small<br /><br />Around a more diverse world in 80 days<br />Katherine Cross<br /><br />Shenmue through a prism<br />Annie Mok<br /><br />Why Silent Hill mattered<br />Leigh Alexander<br /><br />A game studio in Cameroon envisions a new history for Africa<br />Laura Hudson<br /><br />Video games without people of color are not neutral<br />Sidney Fussell<br /><br />How ceMelusine captures a moment<br />Leigh Alexander<br /><br />What games must learn from children’s books<br />Anna Anthropy<br /><br />A unique roleplaying game that lets you literally make history<br />Katherine Cross<br /><br />The radical games event where the next speaker is you<br />Laura Hudson<br /><br />Home is where the future of games is<br />Leigh Alexander",
