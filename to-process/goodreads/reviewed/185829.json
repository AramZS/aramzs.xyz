In a world just down the road from our own, on-line bloggers vie with old-line political operatives and new-style police to determine just where reality lies.<br />Â <br />James Travis is a British patriot and a French spy. On the day the Big One hits, Travis and his daughter must strive to make sense of the nuclear bombing of Scotland and the political repercussions of a series of terrorist attacks. With the information war in full swing, the only truth they have is what they're able to see with their own eyes. They know that everything else is--or may be--a lie.",
