                "description": "Industry Talk is a collection of two previously published columns by Jennifer Brozek, \"Dice and Deadlines\" and \"The Making of an Anthology\". The collection also contains brand-new content including step-by-step instructions on how to pitch an anthology and advice on managing a freelance career.<br /><br />“Want to write for games? Want to navigate the dark labyrinths and endless mazes of freelancing? Let Brozek be your guide.” <br /> – Chuck Wendig, game designer and author of 500 Ways to be a Better Writer<br /><br /><br />“If you’re going to make that leap, though, and come over to the freelance side to join us, don’t go blind. Do your research. Ask questions. Read this book.”<br />– Matt Forbeck, game designer and author of Amortals and Vegas Knights<br /><br /><br />“To those looking to save hours of field research into two highly specialized and hard-to-crack fields, Jennifer Brozek's pragmatic, down-to-earth advice serves as an essential clue-dispenser.”<br />– Robin D. Laws, game designer and author of Hamlet’s Hit Points<br /><br /><br />As Brozek says, “Freelancing for the RPG author is an active thing. You need to look for (or make) the opportunities and grab them.” The first opportunity you should grab is this book. It will give you the information you need to decide whether you’re dedicated enough to become a freelance RPG writer or anthology editor, and if you decide you are, then it will tell you how to go about it. Take Brozek’s advice to heart. She knows what she’s talking about.”<br />– Angel Leigh McCoy, writer for Guild Wars 2 and editor of Wily Writers Podcast",
