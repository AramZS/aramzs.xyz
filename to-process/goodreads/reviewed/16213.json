                "description": "A highly infectious, deadly virus from the central African rain forest suddenly appears in the suburbs of Washington, D.C. There is no cure. In a few days 90 percent of its victims are dead. A secret military SWAT team of soldiers and scientists is mobilized to stop the outbreak of this exotic \"hot\" virus. <i>The Hot Zone</i> tells this dramatic story, giving a hair-raising account of the appearance of rare and lethal viruses and their \"crashes\" into the human race. Shocking, frightening, and impossible to ignore, <i>The Hot Zone</i> proves that truth really is scarier than fiction.",
