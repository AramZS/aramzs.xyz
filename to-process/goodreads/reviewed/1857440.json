They're watching you. <b>My name is David Wong.</b> My best friend is John. Those names are fake. You might want to change yours. You may not want to know about the things you'll read on these pages, about <b>the sauce</b>, about <b>Korrok</b>, about the invasion, and the future. But it's too late. You touched the book. You're in the game. You're under <b>the eye</b>. The only defense is knowledge. You need to read this book, to the end. Even the part with the bratwurst. Why? You just have to trust me.<br /><br /><b>The important thing is this: </b>The drug is called <b>Soy Sauce</b> and it gives users a window into another dimension. John and I never had the chance to say no. You still do. I'm sorry to have involved you in this, I really am. But as you read about these terrible events and the very <b>dark epoch</b> the world is about to enter as a result, it is crucial you keep one thing in mind: <b>\n  <i>None of this was my fault.</i>\n</b>",
