                "description": "<i>'A foot on the neck is nine points of the law'</i><br /><br />There are many who say that the art of diplomacy is an intricate and complex dance. There are others who maintain that it's merely a matter of who carries the biggest stick. The oldest and most inscrutable (not to mention heavily fortified) empire on the Discworld is in turmoil, brought about by the revolutionary treatise <b>What I did on My Holidays</b>. Workers are uniting, with nothing to lose but their water buffaloes; warlords are struggling for power - and what the nation wants, to avoid terrible doom for everyone, is a wizard. Rincewind is not the Disc’s premier wizard – in fact, he can’t even spell ‘wizard’ – but no-one specified whether competence was an issue. And they do have a very big stick…<br /><br />Mighty Battles! Revolution! Death! War! (And his sons Terror and Panic and daughter Clancy).<br /><br /><i>Alternate cover edition for <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17426052-interesting-times\" rel=\"nofollow\">ISBN 9781407034966</a></i>",
