                "description": "<b><i>Planetary</i> has been hailed as a timeless story that turned modern superhero conventions on their heads.</b><br />Written by Warren Ellis (<i>Transmetropolitan</i>) and with stunning art by John Cassaday (<i>Astonishing X-Men</i>), this critically acclaimed, landmark series took a look at the inter-dimensional peace-keeping force known as Planetary.<br />The trio on the ground includes Elijah Snow, a hundred-year-old man, Jakita Wagner, an extremely powerful woman, and The Drummer, a man with the ability to communicate with machines. Tasked with tracking down evidence of super-human activity, these mystery archaeologists uncover unknown paranormal secrets and histories, such as a World War II supercomputer that can access other universes, a ghostly spirit of vengeance, and a lost island of dying monsters.<br /><br /><b>Collecting</b>: <i>Planetary</i> 1-27, Preview; <i>Planetary/Authority</i>: Ruling the World; <i>Planetary/JLA</i>: Terra Occulta; <i>Planetary/Batman</i>: Night on Earth",
