                "description": "<b> What would you give to live forever?</b><br /><br />Seventeen-year-old Elijah Brighton wants to become an ascender--a post-Singularity human/machine hybrid--after all, they're smarter, more enlightened, more compassionate, and above all, achingly beautiful. But Eli is a legacy human, preserved and cherished for his unaltered genetic code, just like the rainforest he paints. When a fugue state possesses him and creates great art, Eli miraculously lands a sponsor for the creative Olympics. If he could just master the fugue, he could take the gold and win the right to ascend, bringing everything he's yearned for within reach... including his beautiful ascender patron. But once Eli arrives at the Games, he finds the ascenders are playing games of their own. Everything he knows about the ascenders and the legacies they keep starts to unravel... until he's running for his life and wondering who he truly is.<br /><br /><i>The Legacy Human</i> is the first in Susan Kaye Quinn's new young adult science fiction series that explores the <b>intersection of mind, body, and soul in a post-Singularity world</b>... and how technology will challenge us to remember what it means to be human.<br /><br /><b>WHAT REVIEWERS ARE SAYING:</b><br />\"This book is Hunger Games (without the violence or controversy) meets Divergent.\"<br /><br />\"If I were a movie producer, I would option this in a heartbeat.\"<br /><br />\"This story is so intense I felt I couldn't get a proper breath.\"<br /><br />\"Science fiction with philosophical depth!\"<br /><br />\"Palpable intelligent fiction at its best, for any age reader.\"",
