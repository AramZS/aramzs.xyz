Not in America. Not to her.<br /><br /><i>This is just the beginning.</i><br /><br />Soon women can no longer hold jobs. Girls are no longer taught to read or write. Females no longer have a voice. Before, the average person spoke sixteen thousand words a day, but now women only have one hundred to make themselves heard.<br /><br /><i>But this is not the end.</i><br /><br />For herself, her daughter, and every woman silenced, Jean will reclaim her voice.",
