Delany is one of the most acclaimed writers of speculative fiction. <br /><br /><b>Babel-17</b><i>,</i> winner of the Nebula Award for best novel of the year, is a fascinating tale of a famous poet bent on deciphering a secret language that is the key to the enemy’s deadly force, a task that requires she travel with a splendidly improbable crew to the site of the next attack. For the first time, <b>Babel-17</b> is published as the author intended with the short novel <b>Empire Star</b>, the tale of Comet Jo, a simple-minded teen thrust into a complex galaxy when he’s entrusted to carry a vital message to a distant world. Spellbinding and smart, both novels are testimony to Delany’s vast and singular talent.",
