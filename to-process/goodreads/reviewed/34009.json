                "description": "Karl Schroeder is one of the new stars of hard SF. His novels, <i>Ventus</i> and <i>Permanence</i>, have established him as a new force in the field. Now he extends his reach into Larry Niven territory, returning to the same distant future in which <i>Ventus</i> was set, but employing a broader canvas. <i>Lady of Mazes</i> is the story of Teven Coronal, a ringworld with a huge multiplicity of human civilizations. It's the story of what happens when the delicate balance of coexisting worlds is completely destroyed, when the fabric of reality itself is torn. <br /><br />Brilliant but troubled Livia Kodaly is Teven's only hope against invaders both human and superhuman who threaten the fragile ecologies and human diversity. Filled with action, ideas, and intellectual energy, <i>Lady of Mazes</i> is the hard SF novel of the year.<br /><br />",
