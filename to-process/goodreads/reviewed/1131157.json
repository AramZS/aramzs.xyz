Now, in this hands-on guide, Denning explains <i>how</i> you can learn to tell the right story at the right time. Whoever you are in the organization CEO, middle management, or someone on the front lines you can lead by using stories to effect change. Filled with myriad examples, <i>A Leader's Guide to Storytelling</i> shows how storytelling is one of the few available ways to handle the principal and most difficult challenges of leadership: sparking action, getting people to work together, and leading people into the future. The right kind of story at the right time, can make an organization \"stunningly vulnerable\" to a new idea.",
