                "description": "<p>The Red Lobster perched in the far corner of a run-down New England mall hasn't been making its numbers and headquarters has pulled the plug. But manager Manny DeLeon still needs to navigate a tricky last shift with a near-mutinous staff. All the while, he's wondering how to handle the waitress he's still in love with, what to do about his pregnant girlfriend, and where to find the present that will make everything better.<br /><br /> Stewart O'Nan has been called \"the bard of the working class,\" and <i>Last Night at the Lobster</i> is one of his most acclaimed works to date.</p>",
