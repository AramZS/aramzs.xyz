                "description": "From his triumphant debut with <i>Snow Crash</i> to the stunning success of his latest novel, <i>Quicksilver,</i> Neal Stephenson has quickly become the voice of a generation. In this now-classic thriller, he and fellow author J. Frederick George tell a shocking tale with an all-too plausible premise. <br /><br />There's no way William A. Cozzano can lose the upcoming presidential election. He's a likable midwestern governor with one insidious advantage - an advantage provided by a shadowy group of backers. A biochip implanted in his head hardwires him to a computerized polling system. The mood of the electorate is channeled directly into his brain. Forget issues. Forget policy. Cozzano is more than the perfect candidate. He's a special effect. <br /><br /><br /><br />\"Complex, entertaining, frequently funny.\" - <i>Publishers Weekly</i><br /><br /><br /><br />\"Qualifies as the sleeper of the year, the rare kind of science-fiction thriller that evokes genuine laughter while simultaneously keeping the level of suspense cranked to the max.\" - <i> San Diego Union-Tribune</i><br /><br /><br />\"<i>Manchurian Candidate</i> for the computer age.\" - <i>Seattle Weekly<br /></i>",
