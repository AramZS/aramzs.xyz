But Miriam’s past is catching up to her, just as she’s trying to leave it behind. A copy-cat killer has caught the public's attention. An old nemesis is back from the dead. And Louis, the ex she still loves, will commit an unforgivable act if she doesn't change the future. <br /><br />Miriam knows that only a great sacrifice is enough to counter fate. Can she save Louis, stop the killer, and survive? <br /><br />Hunted and haunted, Miriam is coming to a crossroads, and nothing is going to stand in her way, not even the Trespasser.",
