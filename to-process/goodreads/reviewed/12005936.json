                "description": "Ours is a century of fear. Governments and mass media bombard us with words and images: desert radicals, -rogue states, - jihadists, WMDs, existential enemies of freedom. We labor beneath myths that neither address nor describe the present situation, monstrous deceptions produced by a sound bite society. There is no reckoning of actuality, no understanding of the individual lives that inaugurated this echo chamber.<br /><br />In the summer of 1999, Mohamed Atta defended a master's thesis that critiqued the introduction of Western-style skyscrapers in the Middle East and called for the return of the -Islamic-Oriental city.- Using this as a departure point, Jarett Kobek's novel ATTA offers a fictionalized psychedelic biography of Mohamed Atta that circles around a simple question: what if 9/11 was as much a matter of architectural criticism as religious terrorism? Following the development of a socially awkward boy into one of history's great villains, Kobek demonstrates the need for a new understanding of global terrorism. Joined in this volume by a second work, -The Whitman of Tikrit---a radical reimagining of Saddam Hussein's last day before capture--ATTA is a brutal, relentless, and ultimately fearless corrective to ten years of propaganda and pandering.",

            "body": "Atta is a book that is hard to describe. Meticulous, fascinating, disturbing. <br /><br />In some ways it might be best to go into this book with no knowledge of what is within, which is how I did it. To be so thoroughly introduced to the internal voice and thought process of a character who is often used to exemplify inhumanity, and whose acts are well deserving of revilement, is to repudiate dehumanization, generalization and demonization. Even our worst enemies are still people; their thoughts and motivations are not uniform, and may not even be what we suspect. Even the clearest of evils does not have the clearest of sources. <br /><br />Jarett Kobek writes a well-researched historical fiction [spoilers removed] Few books will make you think more.",
