Featuring 50 common North American birds, such as the <b>White-Breasted Butt Nugget</b> and the <b>Goddamned Canada Goose</b> (or White-Breasted Nuthatch and Canada Goose for the layperson), Matt Kracht identifies all the idiots in your backyard and details exactly why they suck with ink drawings. <br />Each entry is accompanied by facts about a bird's (annoying) call, its (dumb) migratory pattern, its (downright tacky) markings, and more.<br />The essential guide to all things wings with migratory maps, tips for birding, musings on the avian population, and the ethics of birdwatching.",
