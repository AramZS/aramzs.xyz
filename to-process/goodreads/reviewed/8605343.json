The battles with creatures from beyond time are dangerous; however, it’s the subsequent bureaucratic paperwork that actually breaks men’s souls.  Now, in “Down on the Farm,” Laundry veteran Bob Howard must investigate strange doings at another obscure, moth-eaten government agency—evidently a rest home for Laundry agents whose minds have snapped…</p>\n    <p>Charles Stross is the Hugo-winning author of some of the most acclaimed novels and stories of the last ten years, including <i>Singularity Sky, Accelerando, Halting State,</i> the \"Merchant Princes\" series beginning with <i>The Family Trade,</i> and the story collections <i>Toast</i> and <i>Wireless.</i> In 2010, his Laundry story “Overtime,” published on Tor.com, is a finalist for science fiction’s Hugo Award.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>",
