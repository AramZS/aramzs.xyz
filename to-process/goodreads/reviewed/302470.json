The action centers on the lower-decks crew of the USS da Vinci, a Saber-class ship that serves as the transportation of an SCE team. The SCE reports to Captain Montgomery Scott, who serves as their liaison with Starfleet Command and also pitches in when his vast store of knowledge can be of help.<br />1] HAVE TECH, WILL TRAVEL (S.C.E./STARFLEET CORPS OF ENGINEERS) Anthology series, Book 1.

Just don't expect them to perform miracles, unless they absolutely have to. Captain David Gold, his first officer Commander Sonya Gomez, and the crew of the U.S.S. da Vinci put their lives on the line to save a colony world threatened by a deadly alien and rescue a ship trappedin the ravages of interphase.<br />Contents:<br /> The Belly of the Beast [Star Trek: Starfleet Corps of Engineers • 1] (2000) / novella by Dean Wesley Smith<br /> Fatal Error [Star Trek: Starfleet Corps of Engineers • 2] / novella by Keith R.
