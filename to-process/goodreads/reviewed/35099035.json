                "description": "Five women. One question. What is a woman for?<br /><br />In this ferociously imaginative novel, abortion is once again illegal in America, in-vitro fertilization is banned, and the Personhood Amendment grants rights of life, liberty, and property to every embryo. In a small Oregon fishing town, five very different women navigate these new barriers alongside age-old questions surrounding motherhood, identity, and freedom.<br /><br />Ro, a single high-school teacher, is trying to have a baby on her own, while also writing a biography of Eiv√∏r, a little-known 19th-century female polar explorer. Susan is a frustrated mother of two, trapped in a crumbling marriage. Mattie is the adopted daughter of doting parents and one of Ro's best students, who finds herself pregnant with nowhere to turn. And Gin is the gifted, forest-dwelling homeopath, or \"mender,\" who brings all their fates together when she's arrested and put on trial in a frenzied modern-day witch hunt.",
