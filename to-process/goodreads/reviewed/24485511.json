                "description": "When the first edition of <i>The Media Monopoly</i> was published in 1983, critics called Ben Bagdikian's warnings about the chilling effects of corporate ownership and mass advertising on the nation's news \"alarmist.\" Since then, the number of corporations controlling most of America's daily newspapers, magazines, radio and television stations, book publishers, and movie companies has dwindled from fifty to ten to five.<br /><br />The most respected critique of modern mass media ever issued is now published in a completely updated and revised twentieth anniversary edition.<br /><br />'Ben Bagdikian has written the first great media book of the twenty-first century. The New Media Monopoly will provide a roadmap to understanding how we got here and where we need to go to make matters better.' <br />-Robert McChesney, author of <i>Rich Media, Poor Democracy</i><br /><br /><br /><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i>",
