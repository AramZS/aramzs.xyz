                "description": "<i>Fables: 1001 Nights of Snowfall</i> is set in the early days of Fabletown, long before the <i>Fables</i> series began. Traveling to Arabia as an ambassador from the exiled Fables community, Snow White is captured by the local sultan who wants to marry her (and then kill her). But clever Snow attempts to charm the sultan instead by playing Scheherazade, telling him fantastic stories for a total of 1001 nights, saving her very skin in the process.<br /><br />Running the gamut from unexpected horror to dark intrigue to mercurial coming-of-age, <i>Fables: 1001 Nights of Snowfall</i> reveals the secret histories of familiar <i>Fables</i> characters through a series of compelling and visually illustrative tales. Writer Bill Willingham is joined by an impressive array of artists from comic book industry legends to the amazing young painters of the next wave. <br /><br /><i>Fables: 1001 Nights of Snowfall</i> is both a welcome entry point to the critically acclaimed series and an essential part of Willingham's enchanting and imaginative <i>Fables</i> mythos.",
