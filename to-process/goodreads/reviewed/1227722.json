                "description": "The global war on terror is raging out of control. The president is popping Prozac. And the #1 selling videogame in 2011 is the terrorist-simulator <i>Infidel Massacre: Los Angeles</i>. On the streets of gentrified Brooklyn, videoblogger Jimmy Burns' latest anti-corporate rant is cut short by a terrorist bombing of a Starbucks...but his live feed isn't. When his dramatic footage is uploaded by Global News (\"Your home for 24-hour terror coverage\") and rebroadcast across the planet, the obscure blogger is transformed into an overnight media sensation. The next thing he knows he's on a Black Hawk helicopter inbound for Baghdad, working for the same mainstream media monster he once loathed. Burns soon finds that everyone from his ratings-ravenous network overlords to Special Ops troops with messianic complexes to a charismatic band of tech-savvy <i>jihadists</i> all want to make him their pawn.",
