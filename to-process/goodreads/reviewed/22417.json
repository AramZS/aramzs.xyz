This latest collection of twisted tales showcases Spider's horrific yet funny screeds on subjects as diverse as religion, politics, and his ex-wife's cryogenically frozen head (which has been stolen). \"Transmetropolitan\" has been called \"brilliant future-shock commentary\" (Spin), and this new volume shows why.",
