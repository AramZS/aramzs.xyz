                "description": "All her life sixteen-year-old Katja has been haunted by a strange certainty that she faces a lifetime of conflict. Her dreams foretell of monsters and terrible foes, and she hones combat skills as best she can in a peaceful village in Baldur's Coast despite not understanding who these foes are or what her purpose is. <br />After a demon straight from her nightmares descends on the village with terrible consequences, a strange woman with a young face and an ancient bearing arrives. The stranger promises both the answers and all the dangerous adventures her soul yearns for. With that Katja finally goes out into the wider world. Under the woman's tutelage she beings to hone her supernatural talents as well as her physical ones. But time is short. Old foes seek to step out of the shadows and seize power, and Katja's baptism of fire draws near . . .",
