                "description": "Featuring David Sedaris's unique blend of hilarity and heart, this new collection of keen-eyed animal-themed tales is an utter delight. Though the characters may not be human, the situations in these stories bear an uncanny resemblance to the insanity of everyday life. <br /><br />In \"The Toad, the Turtle, and the Duck,\" three strangers commiserate about animal bureaucracy while waiting in a complaint line. In \"Hello Kitty,\" a cynical feline struggles to sit through his prison-mandated AA meetings. In \"The Squirrel and the Chipmunk,\" a pair of star-crossed lovers is separated by prejudiced family members.<br /><br />With original illustrations by Ian Falconer, author of the bestselling <em>Olivia </em>series of children's books, these stories are David Sedaris at his most observant, poignant, and surprising.",
