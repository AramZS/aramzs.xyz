And she's good at it tooâ€”her new-found ability to talk to cities seems to help. After the success of <i>The Sbambling Guide to New York City</i>, Zoe and her team are sent to New Orleans to write the sequel.<br /><br />Work isn't all that brings Zoe to the Big Easy. The only person who can save her boyfriend from zombism is rumored to live in the city's swamps, but Zoe's out of her element in the wilderness. With her supernatural colleagues waiting to see her fail, and rumors of a new threat hunting city talkers, can Zoe stay alive long enough to finish her next book?",
