And when a freak fire burns up her costume and gear, Babs has the chance to become a whole new Batgirl!<br /> <br />But she barely slips on her new DIY costume before Batgirl starts trending as Gotham’s first viral vigilante — and attracting a new wave of enemies who want her social-media spotlight for themselves. Meanwhile, the girl beneath the gear’s got a whole new crew of friends, college classes that are kicking her Bat-butt and a dating scene that can make anyone want to swipe left on life.<br /> <br />This bat’s done living in the shadows. But will the bright lights of Burnside burn her for good?<br /><br /><b>Collects</b>: <i>Batgirl</i> #35-40 and a story from <i>Secret Origins</i> #10.",
