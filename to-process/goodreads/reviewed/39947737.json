                "description": "<b>A guide to understanding the inner workings and outer limits of technology and why we should never assume that computers always get it right.</b><br /><br />In <i>Artificial Unintelligence</i>, Meredith Broussard argues that our collective enthusiasm for applying computer technology to every aspect of life has resulted in a tremendous amount of poorly designed systems. We are so eager to do everything digitally--hiring, driving, paying bills, even choosing romantic partners--that we have stopped demanding that our technology actually work. Broussard, a software developer and journalist, reminds us that there are fundamental limits to what we can (and should) do with technology. With this book, she offers a guide to understanding the inner workings and outer limits of technology--and issues a warning that we should never assume that computers always get things right.<br /><br />Making a case against <i>technochauvinism</i>--the belief that technology is always the solution--Broussard argues that it's just not true that social problems would inevitably retreat before a digitally enabled Utopia. To prove her point, she undertakes a series of adventures in computer programming. She goes for an alarming ride in a driverless car, concluding \"the cyborg future is not coming any time soon\"; uses artificial intelligence to investigate why students can't pass standardized tests; deploys machine learning to predict which passengers survived the <i>Titanic</i> disaster; and attempts to repair the U.S. campaign finance system by building AI software. If we understand the limits of what we <i>can</i> do with technology, Broussard tells us, we can make better choices about what we <i>should</i> do with it to make the world better for everyone.",
