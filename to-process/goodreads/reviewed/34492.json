                "description": "<p>Tiffany Aching is a trainee witch — now working for the seriously scary Miss Treason. But when Tiffany witnesses the Dark Dance — the crossover from summer to winter — she does what no one has ever done before and leaps into the dance. Into the oldest story there ever is. And draws the attention of the Wintersmith himself.<br /><br />As Tiffany-shaped snowflakes hammer down on the land, can Tiffany deal with the consequences of her actions? Even with the help of Granny Weatherwax and the Nac Mac Feegle — the fightin’, thievin’ pictsies who are prepared to lay down their lives for their “big wee hag.”<br /><br /><b>Wintersmith</b> is the third title in an exuberant series crackling with energy and humour. It follows <b>The Wee Free Men</b> and <b>Hat Full of Sky</b>.<br /><br /><br /><i></i></p>",
