                "description": "<b>With bonus material!</b> This Kindle edition features extra content only found in the Collectorâ€™s Edition of <i>The Mongoliad: Book One</i>, including an illustrated character glossary, a Foreworld map, and Sinner, a prequel to the <i>Mongoliad</i> series.<br /><p>The first novel to be released in The Foreworld Saga, The Mongoliad: Book One, is an epic-within-an-epic, taking place in 13th century. In it, a small band of warriors and mystics raise their swords to save Europe from a bloodthirsty Mongol invasion. Inspired by their leader (an elder of an order of warrior monks), they embark on a perilous journey and uncover the history of hidden knowledge and conflict among powerful secret societies that had been shaping world events for millennia.<br /></p><p>But the saga reaches the modern world via a circuitous route. In the late 19th century, Sir Richard F. Burton, an expert on exotic languages and historical swordsmanship, is approached by a mysterious group of English martial arts aficionados about translating a collection of long-lost manuscripts. Burton dies before his work is finished, and his efforts were thought lost until recently rediscovered by a team of amateur archaeologists in the ruins of a mansion in Trieste, Italy. From this collection of arcana, the incredible tale of <i>The Mongoliad</i> was recreated.<br /></p><p>Full of high adventure, unforgettable characters, and unflinching battle scenes, <i>The Mongoliad</i> ignites a dangerous quest where willpower and blades are tested and the scope of world-building is redefined.<br /></p><p><b>A note on this edition:</b> <i>The Mongoliad</i> began as a social media experiment, combining serial story-telling with a unique level of interaction between authors and audience during the creative process. Since its original iteration, <i>The Mongoliad</i> has been restructured, edited, and rewritten under the supervision of its authors to create a more cohesive reading experience and will be published as a trilogy of novels. This edition is the definitive edition and is the authors' preferred text.</p>",
