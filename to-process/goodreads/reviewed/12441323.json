                "description": "It's 2235 and through the advent of wormhole technology more than a dozen interstellar colonies have been linked to Earth; but this new mode of transportation comes at a price and there are risks. <br /><br />Saul Dumont knows this better than anyone. He's still trying to cope with the loss of the wormhole link to the Galileo system, which has stranded him on Earth far from his wife and child for the past several years. Only weeks away from the link with Galileo finally being re-established, he stumbles across a conspiracy to suppress the discovery of a second, alien network of wormholes which lead billions of years into the future. <br /><br />A covert expedition is sent to what is named Site 17 to investigate, but when an accident occurs and one of the expedition, Mitchell Stone, disappears, they realize that they are dealing with something far beyond their understanding. When a second expedition travels via the wormholes to Earth in the near future of 2245 they discover a devastated, lifeless solar system — all except for one man, Mitchell Stone, recovered from an experimental cryogenics facility in the ruins of a lunar city. <br /><br />Stone may be the only surviving witness to the coming destruction of the Earth. But why is he the only survivor — and once he's brought back to the present, is there any way he and Saul can prevent the destruction that’s coming?",
