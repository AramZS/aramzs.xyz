A world in which at least one cat smells like a seafood shop's dumpster on a hot summer day.<br /><br />This is the world in which Zoey Ashe finds herself, navigating a futuristic city in which one can find elements of the fantastic, nightmarish and ridiculous on any street corner. Her only trusted advisor is the aforementioned cat, but even in the future, cats cannot give advice. At least not any that you'd want to follow.<br /><br />Will Zoey figure it all out in time? Or maybe the better question is, will you? After all, the future is coming sooner than you think.",
