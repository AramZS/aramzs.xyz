The <i>Engine of Recall</i> tales are of ordinary people in astonishing circumstances. Whether stranded alone on the frigid oceans of Saturn's moon Titan, or searching for stolen nuclear bombs under the rusting oil derricks of Azerbaijan, Schroeder's characters assert their humanity in inhuman circumstances.<br /><br />Combining classic adventure and sophisticated speculation, the ten stories in this collection are sure to satisfy a broad range of readers.<br /><br />Includes an introduction by Stephen Baxter.<br /><br />The original story \"Alexander's Road\" was nominated for the Aurora Award -- Canada's top Science Fiction award -- for best short work in English.",
