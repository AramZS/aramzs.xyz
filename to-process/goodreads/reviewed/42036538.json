                "description": "<i>Gideon the Ninth </i>is the most fun you'll ever have with a skeleton.<br /><br />The Emperor needs necromancers.<br /><br />The Ninth Necromancer needs a swordswoman.<br /><br />Gideon has a sword, some dirty magazines, and no more time for undead bullshit.<br /><br />Tamsyn Muir's <i>Gideon the Ninth</i> unveils a solar system of swordplay, cut-throat politics, and lesbian necromancers. Her characters leap off the page, as skillfully animated as necromantic skeletons. The result is a heart-pounding epic science fantasy.<br /><br />Brought up by unfriendly, ossifying nuns, ancient retainers, and countless skeletons, Gideon is ready to abandon a life of servitude and an afterlife as a reanimated corpse. She packs up her sword, her shoes, and her dirty magazines, and prepares to launch her daring escape. But her childhood nemesis won't set her free without a service.<br /><br />Harrowhark Nonagesimus, Reverend Daughter of the Ninth House and bone witch extraordinaire, has been summoned into action. The Emperor has invited the heirs to each of his loyal Houses to a deadly trial of wits and skill. If Harrowhark succeeds she will become an immortal, all-powerful servant of the Resurrection, but no necromancer can ascend without their cavalier. Without Gideon's sword, Harrow will fail, and the Ninth House will die.<br /><br />Of course, some things are better left dead.",
