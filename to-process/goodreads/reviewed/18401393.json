The damaged machinery, unforgiving environment, or plain-old \"human error\" are much more likely to kill him first. <br /><br />But Mark isn't ready to give up yet. Drawing on his ingenuity, his engineering skills—and a relentless, dogged refusal to quit—he steadfastly confronts one seemingly insurmountable obstacle after the next. Will his resourcefulness be enough to overcome the impossible odds against him?",
