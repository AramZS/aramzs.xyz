Glad to finally have a full collection of what is easily one of my favorite comics. When people talk about grim dark adult comics, the examples they bring to the table are usually dumb with an inability to actually tell a story or have real characters operating in that mode, instead it ends up being offensive bs where they can't even get around to telling a story that isn't more than smashing action figures together in blood packs. Here we've got a modern superhero noir that approaches things with an actual story to tell, a real consistent tone to set it in and real characters to tell it.",,,1,0

I understand all the choices, why the writing leans so heavily into 2nd person in the segments it does, why it is structured in the way that it is. All that is impressive. But it can't help the problems of Leckie's overly slow set up and pacing. Where the book is unnecessarily difficult to get through at the start could easily have been shortened, where the book is wrapping things up towards the end is perhaps sometimes too obvious. I found the beginning almost too frustrating to get through, but once the setup was done, the windup was great, exciting and well paced. Then, as soon as the big revelation was revealed, the delivery felt somewhat overindulgent. The rules of the gods, the way power works and is worked in this setting is quite interesting, but Leckie's extremely detailed explanation of how things work ended up working against them here, the result was that I understood the entire final act of the book, exactly how it was going to play out, and why, as soon as that big reveal happens in the bottom half. <br/><br/>The writing itself is excellent so these problems of plotting and narrative construction are a shame. The result is that this book takes far too long to get going, delivers quite a punch, but too early and too hard, and the final portion of the book takes too long to close things out. I enjoyed the book in whole, but it ended up with me spending more time wanting it to move along than enjoying the story, which is unfortunate. <br/><br/>All that said, I'm starting to suspect this is a tic of Leckie's writing, her later books have started to follow this pattern pretty consistently and even earlier books had a hint of this type of pacing issue in basically this same pattern. She consistently spends too much time world building without clear action to move the reader along, the level of detail and rule-describing end up giving too much information, and it gives the early twist or reveal too much power, and then you're spending the end of the book waiting for Leckie to just tie up the details you're most interested in. I enjoy her writing and her unique worlds enough to continue reading her books and so I am not recommending against them at all, but I will say: if you've not read Ann Leckie before, don't start on this book. If you have--especially her last few novels--you likely know if you enjoy or tolerate this pacing and this structure. <br/><br/>I hope Leckie plays around with her plot structure and narrative in future novels as much as she played around with technical writing structure in this novel. I think it is a shame that--to some degree--she robs readers of the satisfaction of drawing their own conclusions. I wish she would create space to have the imagination and a questioning reader play in her world a bit more as opposed to dictating it. Though I suppose this is a fitting problem for this novel to have, considering the plot. It is perhaps a story only Leckie could write: one where gods must carefully choose their words, speak characters into action, and set into motion events with precision and continual tending. A, perhaps unwitting, metaphor for Leckie's own writing choices. Like the gods of The Raven Tower with their supplicants, Leckie doesn't trust the readers to draw their own conclusions. ",,,1,0

In the first, two enemy planets of no consequence at the edge of civilized space are driven into war with each other and The Republic and The Jedi and spend an inordinate amount of time and resources interfering and <spoiler>they come to a perfectly fine peace agreement</spoiler>. Then they spend 2-3 books reversing the conclusion of the first book for this story and eventually take down the external force that drove the two planets into deeper conflict and get those two enemy planets and their leaders <spoiler>back to the exact same endpoint they had reached at the end of the first book</spoiler>. In the second story, almost entirely contained within this book, and I guess Path of Deceit (but multiple official reading lists, including Amazon's don't even have Path of Deceit on them so I didn't read that one) we get the origin story of the Ro family, their weird artifact, their <spoiler>connection with the force-eating predator species</spoiler>, and their extremely badly named spaceship. That second story is wrapped up here with a bunch of relatively short peeks at what the Path was doing in the background of all the other books and a big concluding story that runs parallel to Cataclysm. <br/><br/>You could read either of these books first and it wouldn't matter, especially because the action of the two stories is extremely loosely connected, even when they happen within the same huge battle at the end. <br/><br/>Now, is this big wrap up novel any good? I mean, like a few of the other High Republic books it is--at least--well written on a sentence to sentence basis. I imagine that in a world where this was a self-contained story that didn't need to intersect with the storyline started in Convergence this would be a decent concluding novel. It could easily fit in two books. But it has to do all the setup for being a prequel to phase 1 (which we didn't need) and pay lip service to some sort of integration with the Eiram and E'ronoh story (even though they're barely mentioned here and that story concluded without any of this in the last book) which makes it a mess. I could imagine a version of this story where all the books are written or at least managed with a real serious outline by a single author, but that clearly isn't the case here. So not only is this story weighed down under having to connect up with everything else but it feels--<b>like every other book in Phase 2</b>--it reads like all the books were written with vague descriptions of each other given to the different authors so none of them had any idea what was going on in the other books or what the characters they were writing about were like. <br/><br/>So instead, no characters grow over the course of this series. The Jedi have to do some incredibly dumb stuff. And the big delivery of the plot of what The Mother and The Path were doing turns out to be total nonsense. I feel a little bad giving this book two stars but it is getting -1 for not sticking the landing. It didn't stick the landing by such a degree that the whole book I'm thinking about why nothing connects properly and none of this makes sense. I'm pretty sure this isn't the author's fault, but the fault of whomever is running this thing. <br/><br/>Look, I think this is sort of important to do, what is the through-line, the plot, of this Mother/Open Path arc? It gets its own whole book to wrap up, so I think it is worth walking through now that it is all out in the open. <br/><br/><spoiler><br/><br/>1. The Mother is a little girl and her sister is selected to join the Jedi as a baby child while the Mother--despite having what seems to be pretty extensive force powers--is left behind. <br/><br/>2. The Mother grows up jealous of her sister for and decides to hate the Jedi (by the way this is the 2nd 'Jedi did something near me as a kid and now I hate all Jedi' plot point in Phase 2. <br/><br/>3. The Mother finds a small cult of people on the planet Dalna who believe that The Force shouldn't be used because there is a limited amount and using it causes bad things to happen elsewhere because you put it out of balance (or they are hurting the force by using it, the books are inconsistent on this). <br/><br/>4. The Mother uses her force mind trick powers to pretend she's a prophet, have visions and manipulate The Path (sorry, I just realized, is this *intentionally similar* to ""The Paths"" in Phase 1? That would be very stupid) into making her their leader. <br/><br/>5. The Mother that then decides to execute her plan to 'take down the Jedi' in revenge for recruiting her sister but not her by... poisoning them all? Making them look bad by sabotaging their various peace negotiations? Brainwashing The Path into senselessly throwing themselves into battle with The Jedi and then getting away in her super-ship The Gaze Electric to travel the galaxy claiming the Jedi killed these people for no reason and therefor sabotaging their status in the galactic order and the Republic and therefor opening up a space where she could get close to the Republic and gain power? I think it is the last one.<br/><br/>6. The Mother sends a highly loyal child to manipulate Eiram and E'ronoh back into combat with each other. <br/><br/>7. This makes Eiram panic and create a super poison. <br/><br/>8. Then Eiram goes back on their word to give her the poison when the two planets unexpectedly make peace with each other. <br/><br/>9. The Mother's highly loyal child agent tries to assassinate people to threaten Eiram into giving her the poison. This fails and The Mother orders her killed.<br/><br/>8. The Mother's secret agent--son of one of the two heads of the whole Republic Axel Greylark--steals the poison to give it to her but ends up getting arrested after... blowing up Eiram's big storm dome for some reason and doesn't. <br/><br/>8.5. At some point around here The Mother discovers how to use one half of a force artifact that gives her the ability to control The Leveler a force-eating predator beast which turns force users to stone (remember, she's a force user) that she has paid one of her followers to retrieve. <br/><br/>9. Then she goes to Jedha for with all of the members of the Path to sabotage the peace negotiations between Eiram and E'ronoh which inexplicably don't take place anywhere near the planets nor involve the royals who set up the peace. <br/><br/>9.5. She lets The Leveler feed on her for... some reason? To get bigger I guess. <br/><br/>10. She uses this as cover to steal an artifact which will let her better control The Leveler. She almost doesn't get it. <br/><br/>11. She is almost killed on Jedha while acquiring a bunch of droids that will help her fight the Jedi later (remember, she wants to make it look like the Jedi killed a bunch of defenseless cultists so this part doesn't make sense at all).<br/><br/>12. She goes back to Dalna with her cult where she manipulates galactic communications through taking over a local comms beacon in order to delay news about Jedha which has the end result of villainizing the Path even worse I... guess... in the hope of forcing the Jedi to intervene in force?<br/><br/>13. She sends a bunch of her people on an extremely difficult mission to hopefully bring back some force-eating predator beast eggs that they may or may not succeed at. Despite it all they do. <br/><br/>13. In an act of supreme disorganization somewhere between half a dozen and a dozen (depends on which book you are reading) Jedi sort of ramble on to the planet in groups of 2 to 4. <br/><br/>14. Then everything starts blowing up on Dalna and the combat kicks off and the Jedi are winning. The Mother doesn't have any plans beyond hiding in a tunnel and sending her personal assassin and the Leveler to kill some Jedi.  <br/><br/>15. Because The Mother doesn't have a way to hatch the force-eating predator beast eggs. The Mother is almost killed again. Marda Ro figures out how to hatch the eggs and basically takes over The Path. Ro is the one who decides how to inspire everyone to run out and pointlessly fight the Jedi. The Mother is either very in charge of this fight or totally helpless and not doing anything depending on which book you read. <br/><br/>16. The Jedi predictably win either basically on their own or with the help of a whole bunch of allies depending on which book you read. <br/><br/>17. The Mother gets captured by her own sister and then killed by Marda Ro. <br/></spoiler><br/><br/><br/>What... exactly was the right version of this plan? How are we supposed to care about either the threat of the Path or have any drama with these characters when there isn't any stakes or clear setup or delivery? How can any character evolution happen when they don't have any clear plot to move along? And you might say oh, this is the story of Marda Ro. Well here's her plot:<br/><br/><spoiler><br/>1. She joins the Path. <br/>2. She believes that ""the Force must be Free"" of people who use it like the Jedi. <br/>3. She feels bad about getting a young Jedi killed. <br/>4. She gets force brainwashed and sort of because of herself and sort of because of that she starts a holy revolution twice. <br/>5. She realizes that maybe some force users aren't so bad but still there are a lot of force abusers so she's going to go out and make sure The Force Must Be Free of people who use it who aren't like the Jedi. <br/></spoiler><br/><br/>So her entire evolution is basically <spoiler>Jedi are ok.</spoiler> What? That's not character evolution. That's nonsense. <br/><br/>You could say that this also has something to say about cults... but does it? It isn't really about about cults or cult thinking because it was mostly done via, I must emphasize this, magic Force-based brainwashing. <br/><br/>This whole series has been pulled down by the mess of badly organized nonsense plots and disconnected individual books. It's really too bad, there's potential here, but it never ever gets fully realized. <br/><br/>",,,1,0

Is there a Disney executive sitting over these books too being like ""someone has to swing a lightsaber every 15 pages or the readers will get bored""? <br/><br/>This book appears to conclude the plot regarding Eiram and E’ronoh to an unsatisfactory conclusion. <spoiler>Uhhh the two young royals bring piece through their marriage and promise to do the work of diplomacy themselves this time. They are great characters who are barely in this book. That's all I'm going to say about that plotline because it is about as much as the book has to say.</spoiler> As I anticipated in my review of The Battle of Jedha, that book proved to be a cul-de-sac in the overarching plot with not much added to the story. This one two is oddly focused. It feels like the entire back half of the novel is one overly long battle. Saying it was exhausting to read gives it too much credit, it was just mostly boring. I don't need any more descriptions of Jedi force throwing people or blaster shots. What I do need is an explanation. It appears the actual wrap up of the Path of the Open Hand might be in Path of Vengeance¹ but I'm not sure. What we have here is entirely unsatisfying. Again the Path has some sort of mysterious plan. Again there's their enmity with the Jedi and the use of the ""Leveler"". But to what end? Despite being the central enemy of this enormous arc, the stakes have never been clear because their goals have never been clear beyond ""Jedi bad"". Here they seem to be attempting to frame the Jedi for doing an atrocity... I guess. Our wise and far-seeing Jedi all fall right into the trap. And then... uhhhh...... I don't know. The Path comes out in much worse shape despite the fact that, as far as I can tell, all the events of this books seem to have gone exactly as they planned? Unless their plan was that every Jedi in the galaxy would show up on this one planet and get slaughtered?<br/><br/>Anyway, in this book the religious protesters turn out to be conniving evil plotters who have weapons of mass destruction which require military intervention by an alliance of powers who can't help but kill civilians because the evil religious zealots <spoiler>literally place old people above the base and next to the surface to air guns.</spoiler> Kiss subtlety goodbye! This--which is the core plot point that involves dozens, if not hundreds, of deaths; torture; the killing of many point of view characters; and a few pretty decently described horrific moments--brings up the question: are you really sure you want to mix this with your lightweight YA books? I've only read a few of the High Republic YA books and while they are mostly bad, they're also mostly an entire tonal shift from the adult books like this one. It seems crazy to me to try and tie these all together in a single overarching plot.  <br/><br/>The biggest problem with the stakes is that... there are none. The Jedi basically set off a miniature war on the Path's planet by stumbling into it. There's really no reason they couldn't have... not gone to the planet. Really, the Path's entire plan seems to be around making them feel like they have to show up, but there's no reason they have to at all! Eiram and E’ronoh as one of the multiple inciting incidents is a big part of this problem because, while the characters seem to think Eiram and E’ronoh are important to the fate of the galaxy... no one shows us this. I'm three books into this prequal series and not a single person has described why Eiram and E’ronoh earn the attention of multiple leaders of the Republic and a squadron of Jedi for what must be at least a year. <br/><br/>Then there is Axel Greylark and Gella Nattai. Gella is interesting enough and I enjoyed much of her time in the spotlight of the book's attention (not enough). But Axel. Oh Axel, clearly designed to be the bad boy all the girls want, you make no sense. It isn't that his decision making is abnormally bad (this is in character and mostly fine) it's that his involvement in the Path is inexplicable. Ok, they both hate Jedi, but why did The Mother invest so much time in him? <spoiler>Because she thought he was going to blackmail him mom and his mom would just go along with it?</spoiler> Because she thought he was going to *become* chancellor? Because she's really not a planner but a flighty weirdo who wants to be rich even though that goes against every other characterization of her but appears to be the case here? <spoiler>Breaking him out of jail seems like it would be a lot of work but all that to try and force The Republic to do... something?</spoiler> I don't understand the plot reasons for him to be in this story no matter how fun a character he is. I would love one sentence where The Mother explains even a bit of her plan. Instead The Path and the Mother and her dumb reoccurring spaceship are just nebulous ""bad guys"" here and elsewhere in THR prequels. <br/><br/>There are other stakes here, but none of them feel anything close to weighty because they're built off one of the dozen or more point of view characters. There are just too many characters here and none of their point of view plotlines get enough weight. <br/><br/>As far as I can tell, this rounds up the main plot of The High Republic prequels which means at the end, over the course of three adult books and multiple YA and comic books (which I haven't read most of, sorry, but like... these are too hard to get hold of and the mainline books are bad enough) the Path's main impact has been... they built a big space ship.<br/><br/>Wait... <br/><br/>Is all this prequel nonsense just there to give The Origin Story of the <spoiler>Gaze Electric</spoiler>? Was that the gd pitch? WHO CARES. What is the point of this nothing of a prequel series? You can't write books like their TV shows or movies. No one is coming to the Star Wars books for the ""exciting"" lightsaber battles. As far as I can tell, the only whole characters are Axel Greylark and his mother. They're the only ones that learn anything or grow. At one point in this book the Jedi (who apparently haven't invented childcare) drag a tiny child into combat who proceeds to contribute to people around her getting killed, learns about it, feels sad, and then does the exact same thing again. No one other than the Greylarks appear to evolve or learn anything and neither of them are even in The Battle of Jedha. <br/><br/>The results of this is lightweight fluff. Confusing lightweight fluff. It feels like this, along with the other books, have something they want to say but don't know how to say it, or maybe have some sort of decree from Disney that they have to over-stuff these books with battles and POV characters. There are so many POV switches in this book that Yoda gets his own POV. The Point of View switches can't even be contained per chapter, they'll just happen in the middle of something else. Sometimes they'll happen in the middle of a sentence. Just more characters, more stuff, gotta mention the <spoiler>Gaze Electric a huge battleship that is floating over this big battle but forgets to participate</spoiler>, just one thing after another. I'm sorry, because this book was actually well written, but from a plot perspective it feels like how watching The Rise of Skywalker feels. Everything is happening, nothing makes sense, no time for characters to sit with you.<br/><br/>Like the rest of the Prequel series this is just a mess and a waste of potential. <br/><br/>¹Note: So, no one can tell me if this book is intended to be read before or after ""Path of Vengeance"". It was published before that book, and is listed before that book in more than one list. However, the official list (which has led me astray before) <a href=""https://www.starwars.com/news/every-star-wars-the-high-republic-book-and-comic-series"" target=""_blank"">on the Star Wars website</a> says it comes after. I have started Path of Vengeance and it seems to be maybe a semi-parallel story with either this book or The Battle of Jedha or both. So maybe some of the confusion I'll talk about below would have been solved if I had read the other book first? I'm sorry, they have full control over publication order, and it was only about a month apart. There's no reason they couldn't have published these books in order and made them more clear so, sorry.

The idea that two factions might be be invited to some neutral world to negotiate a treaty is fine, it makes sense, but the idea that <spoiler>when negotiations broke down they wouldn't take their ships and go but instead destroy a random planet they know nothing about covered in potential allies and enemies is... baffling</spoiler>. The logic of the central conflict here doesn't hold well. The various back and forth on the question of how the Force works is, again, interesting, but we can't really take the Path's philosophy seriously when the Mother was in the first THR prequel book conniving, manipulating and orchestrating arbitrary slaughter, even if she actually believes in what she's saying (very unclear) her existing background makes her protestations to protect the Force uninteresting and unbelievable. <br/><br/>The book introduces some new factions that are particularly interesting, but their inclusion is relatively light weight. The main action around the various sabotages and battles is overly lengthy and doesn't do much to push either the plot of the book, or the plot of the broader arc, forward.<br/><br/>On the subject of the broader arc, this is a mere cul-de-sac. Almost none of the characters from book 1 are in this (though they return in book 3) and all this book does is reverse the plot of the first book, pretty much entirely, only to get it back to the beginning of book 1 by midway through the next book. Unless you have some investment in characters here from their apparent inclusion in the Star Wars comics or some other media I seem to have missed, I'd skip this book entirely. The entire thing gets recapped in the first few chapters of the next book and--like I said--basically reversed again. It doesn't help that so much of the plot's connection to the wider arc here is handled by going 'oops all comms are down' over and over. Isn't this the *High Republic*? They can't keep the phones on?  <br/><br/>The big bad of the novels is here, totally incompetent and characterized very differently from the first book. The person she's manipulating to work with her in this story also is entirely incompetent. Despite the implication that they both planned out and pushed for the titular battle, <spoiler>they're both caught in the crossfire and immediately almost killed. The Mother survives of course, but only because she's rescued by a Jedi</spoiler>.<br/><br/>What was the point of all this any way? I'm now ~half way into the third book and the Path still has no clear motivation. None of the things they are doing seem to be accomplishing any particular organizational goals. Their goals themselves are not clear. There is a difference between a mystery and a vacuous space where the plot should be, as far as I can tell in these books the Path has nothing that clearly motivates the specific actions they take here, the last book, or the next book. <br/><br/>The description of this book says ""the galaxy still reels from the violence on Eiram and E’ronoh""...<br/><br/>but does it? <br/><br/>Eiram and E’ronoh make interesting enough settings for a nice self-contained story (perhaps even a multi-book one) in the Star Wars universe, but the first book made it very clear that they are minor planets in a backwater system. As unfortunate as it would be, if the two of them destroyed each other there doesn't seem to be any hint that would impact anyone at all. It's called the Forever War because the two planets have been fighting each other *forever*. In all that time, it didn't seem to matter to the wider galaxy and indeed, if it wasn't for an accidental intervention by a junior Jedi, they almost did destroy each other and no one did anything. This book also fails to explain why anyone cares about Eiram and E’ronoh beyond basic humanitarian reasons. Why is the Big Bad and her Big Bad Ship so interested in seeing them fight? Why has one of the two <b>heads of the Republic</b> spent what must be half a year at least hanging out there? Why are there so many Jedi involved, especially at this stage of their history when they seem not as large or dominant a sect? <br/><br/>None of these questions are answered, or even hinted at, in this book. Instead I endlessly wonder what anyone's motivations are. <br/><br/>The choice to produce this particular entry as an audio play / script is particularly unfortunate. It's very combat focused and hard to follow by ear and so this book suffers from what few of the other THR books does--actually being quite badly written in places. The dialogue is well put together enough, but a bunch of spy stuff and intrigue paired with extensive combat scenes are both frustrating and interminable. <br/><br/>There's not much here to recommend beyond some good characters and--if you get the audio version--some good voice performances. If you are reading the books and the books alone I think skipping this entry is not only possible, but preferable.",,,1,1

It's bad throughout both the YA and adult High Republic books: teen Jedi knights, teen master pirates, teen spaceship captains etc...<br/><br/>One of the coolest things about The Last Jedi was that it conceived of a place for teens within the Star Wars universe that wasn't just Padawans and was still interesting. Sadly none of these books seem to have picked up on its ideas. This is perhaps the worst of all, centered around a teen force-enhanced super soldier and a teen owner of a major bounty hunter company. As the jobs these teens do get more inexplicable the more it seems like child labor is just... an accepted norm in the Star Wars universe. A one off here or there might seem exceptional, but with every one of these books filled with teen and kid job holders it just feels like the norm. It comes off as sad that apparently even during The High Republic every potential laborer had to be 'put to use' and as a result there feels like there is a *ton* of child labor that is generally acceptable, even in the core worlds. <br/><br/>Maybe this would go down easier if this was a good book but this one is just interminable even by the standards of YA Star Wars. There are at least 5 or 6 major plot-lines and flashbacks going here and it is hard for any of them to maintain any tension as a result, the pacing drives me crazy, and every single character is so over the top it is hard to care. Perhaps part of the problem is the audiobook edition, which gives every character a particular manic energy, but the plots--themselves so much treading water--they just doesn't seem to hold the type of weight they should for what is going on, perhaps because each is punctuated by so many others. But more than that, I'm no longer YA but, it is hard to conceive of an iteration of YA readers that feel engaged by kid bodyguard manager, who is far too central, and around who is executed an increasingly bizarre set of hijinks while the emotion of the opening scenes is written out of the character until needed. For all the characters narrate about their feelings few seem to have any internality. All of these problems build together to create a book that I almost couldn't finish.<br/><br/>EDIT: Now that you've gotten to what is apparently the end of Phase 1 (not much of an ending really) <a href=""https://books.disney.com/content/uploads/2022/05/SWTHR_PHASE-I_JEDI-Character-Chart.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Disney has helpfully provided you with a PDF of the characters</a>. >.< ",,,1,0

I don't know how long before or why they would do that or how I was supposed to have known this. Correcting it here. <br/><br/>I had hoped that the various High Republic novels might take a X-Files-y approach, occasionally focusing on building lore and connective tissue while giving us the chance to explore the historical high points of the Jedi and The Republic in interesting ways and places we hadn't before. I would never have expected there to not only be One Big Bad that runs through all the stories but also like... across <s>multiple centuries</s> an immense amount of time? <br/><br/>The ideas that are brought forth here are somewhat interesting. I actually really like the idea of some religious order that feels the Jedi are somehow 'using up' the Force. I think it's been done before (there was a Green Lantern take on this a while back that did it particularly well and then failed to really follow up) but it was an interesting starting point. It's too bad it seems like, at least in this book, it is yet another cover for yet another incredibly dumb <spoiler>obsession with The Gaze Electric starship, it's captain and its weirdish powers or something. When they said its name I audibly groaned out loud</spoiler>. You would think by this point Star Wars writers would be know better than to spend multiple entries obsessing over a phantom menace.<br/><br/>I also like the idea of focusing in on a particular small corner of the galaxy, when it can keep its focus. Like the rest of the new Star Wars books it reads very very busy. We don't get enough time to stay with any of the characters to really feel for them and we don't get enough time exploring the new pieces of the setting to enjoy it fully. Instead, we end up skipping back to The Republic's politics a lot, which clearly aren't going as well as they should be considering this is The High Republic, and the Jedi, who are also unclear on what exactly their purpose is here... or anywhere. <br/><br/>This is all a shame. In the pre-Disney era of Star Wars you'd read books with complete stories where the charm was strong characters running through multiple books. A great example is Wedge Antilles who was turned from basically a name in the script to a strongly described interesting character with some depth via staring in complete stories over multiple books. Another good one is Mara Jade. But this is basically impossible in the format of these books. For one, there are no complete stories, you are basically getting an episode of a Disney+ Star Wars show, but unlike the Star Wars show there is no given main protagonist. <br/><br/>Who is this wider story about?!? Is it about the two warring planets? No, they're just constantly manipulated from both sides by the poorly defined phantom menace. Is it about the two royals? No. The next book in the series spends 20 pages handwaving them out of the plot. Is it about the conflicted Jedi? No, she's off to be a wayfinder by the end. Is it about the troubled son of the co-head of The Republic who *sigh* <spoiler>hates Jedi because one of them decided to save him instead of his father in a space car crash, a development so predictable it was already tired in the meh I, Robot film</spoiler>? Doesn't seem to be. Is it about the Republic leader who is so generic and poorly fleshed out I don't realize he had face tentacles until half way through the book and whose only characterization is he *like peace* and has a politician's appetite for attention? Is it about the Republic leader with the shitty son who is... a politician of some sort with the apparent emotional affect of a Vulcans? Is it about the senior Jedi who is so boring I can literally remember no distinguishing characteristic? Is it about the young terrorist who seems to have some sort of legitimate concern about the Jedi? No she's <spoiler>dead</spoiler>. So none of these people then. <br/> <br/>So I guess this larger story is actually about The Mother. But she has almost no lines and almost no characterization beyond lurking in the shadows of a comlink and being sith-style evil. So really it isn't *about anyone*. <br/><br/>This particular chapter of that story is focused more than anyone else on the two young royals, but only barely. There are sections with battles that drag because there are no clear stakes. Then there are times you can basically see the montage sequence in your mind's eye. In theory there is also a villainous Vizier but his character spirals to nothing. There's also his villainous son who I think is being set up to return as some sort of terrorist. Even as generic as they are that part is more interesting because the royals are more fleshed out than anyone else and the conflict between their worlds feels somewhat grounded in a cycle of violence that feels like it has some depth. <br/><br/>The other problem that comes in here is that the author is clearly in some sort of 40s newsreal/Flash Gordon mode. The style and the focus on the various space royals feels strongly reminiscent of the serials that informed the original Star Wars. But it doesn't work for a few reasons. We only come in at the end of the war between planets so the newsreal-esque skipping around doesn't really serve the plot or the feel well. The Flash Gordon mode with endangered space royals, Jedi doing vaguely mysterious Space Magic, and preening politicians works well with the original Star Wars because of the layout of the plot and setting. But this is *supposed* to be the High Republic right? Conan in Space isn't working here and the dissonance is particularly bad because there's no clear enemy for the good guys to fight and the gloating bad guys are too old-fashioned I guess. <br/><br/>Without the plot conceit of exploring a vast expanse with no civilization to support you against evil or a clearly good guys vs bad guys war the whole 40s vibe falls apart and without that you start to think about how weird it is that the so-called High Republic seems... really bad at this? <br/><br/>Like, there's a planet here that's basically filled with people dying of... thirst?!? I understand there's some political nuance but instead of just space-dropping boxes of water on to the planet they embargo it because 'war bad'?! We're also forced to wonder: why is the *Republic* so hot on a bunch of *royals*? Not to mention the whole situation apparently requires the attention of both of the co-leaders of the Republic but... no one has to be consulted? There's not some consequence to both of the leaders of the government.... disappearing for weeks on end?  Don't they have a *job*? Also, why does the playboy son of a co-chancellor get top level security clearance to everything? Don't the Jedi need... a warrant or something before they <spoiler>hack a guy's *therapy droid* and show all his private recordings to the leaders of three different governments and his mother</spoiler>?<br/><br/><i>screams internally</i> If there is any lesson Star Wars should have learned it is that you can't do  some sort of shades of grey political drama without thinking through the details of how things actually work. <br/><br/>This is all such an incredible waste. This could just be a standalone story about a Jedi and a Han Solo-type sent in to a situation over their heads that they have to mediate on the far outer reaches of the galaxy. Having an entire ship of Republic politicians, and entire ship of Jedi, and the unfortunate fact that it is all apparently like... a week away from Coruscant just deflates the entire thing. There is a bunch of interesting ideas and some great descriptive moments of the two warring planets but it is all lost in what feels like a bunch of nonsense inserted in to serve some larger story that I cannot find any reason to care about, especially considering it is apparently the same larger phantom menace story happening as it was <s>100 years ago or something like that</s> in the last series we read, and it was just as uninteresting and nonsensical then. Especially considering the writing is fairly well done here just stretched and deformed around this meh plot. <br/><br/>To top it off I started the 2nd book in the prequel High Republic series and uhhh... none of the even marginally interesting characters from this that could potentially have been expanded on are in it and it spends an inordinate amount of time explaining why it makes sense (it doesn't) to roll back much of the conclusion of this book. The young royals were easily the most solid part of this book and they basically get name-checked out in the first half of the next novel. I assume, never to return. Seems like a bad idea! Is anyone out there managing these stories? It feels like they are just slicing off a set of plot points and giving it to different writers in parallel in all these High Republic books. Give me either a good set of individual stories or a good overarching plot that splits evenly into chapters that connect properly with each other. But sitting in the middle of those two options gives The High Republic the feel of a half-baked conceit that no one can bring themselves to care about. <br/><br/>I don't know why I keep reading these. I guess I keep hoping the time I invested in these will somehow pay off and give me some sort of actual conclusion to any of the major plot threads they keep weaving but I'm starting to doubt that they even have a plan to try that. This is now Phase II and Phase 1 doesn't seem to have concluded unless I missed it happening in some comic somewhere. I think it's just they have invested a great deal in making the audio books fun to listen to and whatever, some nights I need something that can put me to sleep I guess. <br/><br/>What a disappointment.",,,1,1

Given the opportunity to explore a particular interesting corner of his own creation he'd rather world build and complicate things. The whole thing feels intentionally difficult to follow and that's only exacerbated by this series' tendency to switch back and forth between horizontal double truck panels and standard page flow with very little to distinguish between the two, making reading difficult.<br/><br/>Like his other series, he lands on one very interesting character and builds around them, sometimes this works, sometimes it doesn't, and in the case of this book, peeling the side character off the more interesting character from the main series does not work well for character or plot. The visuals of the book are great, but I won't be picking up book 2.",,,1,0

While I think it is relatively successful as a book in its own right, the work assigned was clearly to set up a bunch of story threads that seem to naturally flow into the prequel episodes of Star Wars and that is a heavy load to lift. <br/><br/>There's no getting around the problems of Eps 1-3 in that they portray the Jedi Order of this particular era as weak-willed cops, policing the status quo and this book definitely acknowledges that; but in doing so it makes the whole thing even more depressing.<br/><br/>The galaxy is apparently filled with child rulers, that's just a thing, it wasn't some weird cultural one-off for Naboo. The Republic is basically worse than useless here. It isn't just that the Republic and the Jedi can't enforce the rule of law over the outer regions, they also can't enforce it over huge companies that span the galaxy either. Whatever power they have as a governing entity seems more than captured by corporate interests here. It is particularly ironic because it means that the Republic would have likely normally have rolled over for the Trade Federation, it turns out that the disruption to the Republic that started the process of breaking it wasn't that the Trade Federation was trying to exert unfair power, but that the Republic stood up to them at all. It is made pretty clear here that most corps can and do roll over entire planets' governments with ease. At one point one of the mega corp's reps offhandedly mention that they have whole planets dedicated to nothing but marketing and PR--a more depressing concept I can't imagine. And Slavery. I can see the notes to the author now: 'we have to create a backstory for why Jinn is so opposed to slavery he's willing to cheat' and like... no you shouldn't but yeah, in this universe as set up, apparently you *do* need to create that backstory because while the Republic and the Jedi are very sad about slaves part of the point of this book's plot is that they don't really feel any need or interest in *doing* anything about them. <br/><br/>Incredibly depressing stuff because it means that all the heroes of the Old Republic were complicit. The Jedi were actually off fighting a heroic war... to preserve the system that lets slavery happen. I mean... we can go on about if the Droids are intelligent  and t/f slaves (let's just go with Star Wars media's assumption they aren't sentient beings here, for the sake of simplicity) but if you think about it for even five seconds the implication raised by this book are that the Jedi fought to defend slavery just sorta happening out in the galaxy against the Trade Federation... apparently one of the few mega corps that *didn't* use it. Mon Mothma? The Alderaan royal family? The representatives of the Republic Council? It wasn't just the immediate lead up to the Empire where they failed in their responsibility, but basically their entire lives, perhaps generations of them. <br/><br/>At the end of this story this particular solar system has abolished slavery and still managed to complete the economic imperatives set out for them by Republic leadership and even managed to transform themselves into a democracy, but--as the book itself points out--this is all in opposition to the Republic's attempts to resolve things. If either the Republic or Jedi Council plans had played out, it wouldn't have ended up a full democracy and slavery likely never would have been abolished, perhaps only minimized. <br/><br/>The book even cleverly touches on how this economic system across the galaxy creates an economic imperative to generate prison industrial complexes but when the question is raised: ""why use slaves when you live in a future with droids and automation"" the answer is just ""because they can"" which is incredibly unsatisfactory. The book outlines all the worst conditions of an overly capitalist galaxy, it even touches on the underlying systems that enforce these problems; but does not or cannot engage in them. While the plot chugs along quite well I could not help but be distracted by the fact that like most of the current pre-Eps 1 stories it falls into the trap of the assumptions of a 50s sci-fi mindset that was really just the trappings of Star Wars. It is somewhat ironic that Eps 4-6 were dressed up in the 50s serials but were intended to be a tale of a communist uprising, only for almost all of the rest of Star Wars to take the 50s sci-fi trappings but not think deeply about what the Rebellion was about or doing. The result is that most of the Star Wars prequels like to talk about the Republic Council but they can't really escape the 50s-era obsession with inevitable Empires and space royalty. The implications of The Empire and all these little system-level royals being that empires are inevitable. <br/><br/>In some ways Eps 1-3 (and 8) were most interesting when they insisted that we examine what was an often consistent assumption in Sci Fi that Empires are inevitable. And to challenge the old 50s era SF that often portrayed galactic empires as benevolent and their resulting capitalist abuse of their people as natural. But in playing in the lead up to the fall of the Old Republic too much Star Wars fiction accidentally implies the opposite, that there is no way the systems of democracy, or any other system of government or economics, could function or spread in the Star Wars universe. <br/><br/>It is too bad. Qui-Gon Jinn is painted as an extremely interesting character in this muck of a universe and the greatest shame of all is that this book sums up his arc by stating he sacrificed himself for Anakin, in part explicitly out of a hope that his role in prophesy would end slavery in the galaxy. Too bad Qui-Gon Jinn turned out to be the biggest fool of all. The Skywalker prophesy ended and not only is slavery as bad as ever in the Star Wars universe, it seems inevitable. Like this book, it ends up pulling down everything going on in a distracting mire of a galaxy that cannot imagine a real future for itself. ",,,1,0

Perhaps even of the entire Robots-Empire-Foundation cycle. The previous book, a series of short stories that give flashes of insight into the evolution of the Foundation, is a classic of its time but--with a modern eye--reads not quite as engaging or far flung into the future as one might expect. Asimov's biases are on full display there. But here the high minded sci-fi imagination meshes with an almost adventure-serial format and Asimov must put aside many of his less-modern predications in order to make it work. Here there's less cigar chomping, man's-manning and less misogyny  because he cannot rely on broad strokes to carry characters the whole book long. <br/><br/>It drags a bit in the third act (another characteristic of the old serial stories searching for a conclusion), but the valuable longer time with characters, the exploration of a both high science and fallen galaxy, these are the pieces of Asimov's work that leave the lasting impression that is attributed to the larger Foundation series. The first book sets up many interesting ideas but does not live in them, while this book makes the whole series feel fleshed out and lived in so well that it almost makes you forget the first Foundation book's deficiencies, both 50s-era problems and Asimov's own. <br/><br/>",,,2,0

There wasn't anything particularly bad about books 1 or 2, but they didn't feel particularly interesting either, not the way that Zahn's previous work did. This is easily the best in the series for a lot of reasons internal to the book, but also because I finally got back around to the Thrawn series after reading the Thrawn Ascendancy series and watching all the Star Wars cartoons. <br/><br/>A lot of things that came off as strange choices in the first two books I now understand better as part of the larger context established in other media. I don't think that's great, and it doesn't really help that--on their own--those books are somewhat weak. The threat dealt with in book 2 is especially boring without the context of the Ascendancy series which really... really really... should have been published before this series and made available to read in the order that is chronologically accurate to the character of Thrawn. It's hard to detach what makes this book good now from the way it so effectively plugs in to the Ascendancy novels (which are overall much better than this series and stand very effectively on their own, even from the larger Star Wars universe). That said, I do think this is an interesting novel on its own, even solo from the other novels in the Thrawn series, which feel like so much treading water leading up to this. The previous two books were really only interested in establishing one plot point per book to support this novel and the rest of the stuff in each could be fun, but was really pretty much gloss. <br/><br/>Here is basically a standalone Star Wars book, with a ton of good references to modern Star Wars but also a fantastic self-contained story in which this model of character shines. If Thrawn is based on anything it is Sherlock Holmes and here he gets a great little mystery to solve where you get lots of little bits to solve along with him. You get more hints if you come in with the previous novels. And there is a whole (from a plot perspective) bit I'll get to in the spoiler section that seems mostly here to set up a bunch of fun mystery-battles, which is really the only way to think of the fleet-battle set pieces that pop up quite a few times, but at the end of the day this is a Holmesian mystery story in the Star Wars universe where you get to see things get blown up. And you know, that's fun. Thrawn is characterized perhaps best in this, because everyone around him is his Watson, and he gets to trip a bit over his fatal flaw. Most of the other POV characters are all trained in some way by Thrawn so they all get to do their take on his special skill and a bunch of big Star Wars references are happening all around this that enrich the story and, in reading the story, enrich a bunch of other Star Wars media. The Ascendancy series is a far better series and any individual book in it is a better SF book, but this is the best Star Wars book of the two series. Very enjoyable. Zahn is a great writer and this is the only book in the Thrawn series where he doesn't feel tied down by a bunch of other Star Wars writers' stuff.<br/><br/><spoiler><br/><br/>Ok, we need to talk about the Grysks. They make for a fine opponent in the Ascendancy series as a sort of perfectly formed empty shape that fills in as a foil for Thrawn. But they are extremely frustrating in a larger context, especially in this book. The idea that Thrawn fixates on them as a threat to the Ascendancy is fine. Makes total sense. I even like the idea that he finds his way into the Empire in part because he's looking for someone who will free his hands from the Ascendancy's self-defense-only policy to deal with them. <br/><br/>I think it doesn't add a lot to the established character, because--as established in Heir to the Empire--he's a creepy ultra smart dude whose fighting the good guys because he's... a bad guy who wants to be in charge. This seems like weak motivation but it's basically just a fetish for order and he wants to clean up the rabble and he's real good at it. It's a perfect fit for Star Wars as established at the time. An Imperial Admiral? Who wants order above freedom? Especially one with some Sherlock-style OCD? Sold. Ok. But to integrate him into the larger universe of New Star Wars they've had to do some weird things with his character. In Heir, he stomps all over people because he's the highest ranking officer and he loses because he doesn't understand that fundamentally he can't actually perfectly control everyone. This is recast in the new books as a Sherlock-style social dysfunction, he's a brilliant tactician who keeps getting tripped up by politics. This has to happen for a bunch of reason but mostly because he is... <br/><br/>you know... I hate to say it...<br/><br/>*the bad guy* <br/><br/>And so in any Star Wars media he's not the protagonist of he has to lose and he's too smart to loose to kid Jedi and his rag tag band of weirdos in Rebels so boom, fatal flaw. I think Zahn does a pretty good job in this book particularly of showing us what that fatal flaw means and what it does. That's all fine. Cool. Good. But then there needs to be something else. See, if he isn't just a purely brilliant weirdo who caught the Emperor's eye and if we need to sympathize with him as the hero of his own novels he needs to uhhhh not be the bad guy? That means he needs to have his own reason to go to the Empire other than just being cool and friends with Palpy. It also means he needs to have a sympathetic reason to go to the Empire and to fight for the Empire and so we get the Grysks. The Grysks here are even more of an (excuse the reference) phantom menace than in the Ascendancy novels. And everyone keeps looking funny at Thrawn being like 'uhhhh should the Empire /really/ care about this distant race of super manipulators?'. A thing that they're sort of right to question him on! And Thrawn keeps telling them that Grysks are coming for the Empire any minute and so we're supposed to sympathize with him and his need to eliminate this greater threat and we're supposed to understand that he sort of *is* playing the Emperor for his own people's interests. (Though I looked this up in *sighh* Wookieepedia and apparently he defeats their leader in a novella that was published in 2011? Lame.)  But he has to have 1. a reason to stay in the Empire after determining that they're uhhh not that interested in doing what he wants to do. And 2. a reason to stay in the Empire after it falls apart as a meaningful power that would help him accomplish his goals. The reason is set up in this book that the Grysks are not just master manipulators but Ultra Super Amazing manipulators, basically able to rob not just leaders, but entire civilizations of their free will (methodology not noted here. Or anywhere I can tell). Wookieepedia paraphrases this book in its description of their threat ""it only took three Grysks to rule a nation and only one hundred to rule a world"". <br/><br/>This means that Thrawn isn't just a hero in his own mind but an *actual hero* fighting a threat to the entire galaxy that is persistent, terrible, and even worse than the Empire. Perhaps he's a flawed hero and his means don't justify his ends but his ends are rewritten here to be Good, Actually and that sort of sucks for his character but also for the implications of the entire Star Wars universe. Notably, this novel implies that the Grysks may have some hand in manipulating the Rebels against The Empire and uhhh<br/><br/>That fkin sucks my friends. <br/><br/>The idea that the Rebels aren't freedom fighters but an actual fifth column manipulated by some aliens who want to rule the humans and the various races they've enslaved in the Empire has like tons of nasty historical references that I don't think Zahn or anyone else involved here has really thought through. It also makes those characters struggles meaningless and casts the entire Star Wars story as basically in service of Thrawn's story, a story in which the Rebellion is wrong, or at the very least misguided do-gooders manipulated to stop the Empire from eventually getting around to killing off the Grysks under Thrawn's leadership. Like yeah, the Death Star was bad, but should we really be dealing with the bad guys over there everyone? <br/><br/>It's extremely stupid. I don't think anyone has thought through the implications and the Grysks just sort of suck. Like... I don't know how to tell you all this. I like Thrawn too. He's a great character. But he's a bad guy. He's wrong. We should not be trying to re-frame him to be right because we like him. Like it's ok for him to be a bad guy and for us to enjoy him being a bad guy. Lean into it. Have him cackle and rub his hands together more. It's ok! <br/><br/>Maybe I'm wrong here, maybe Thrawn is going to turn out to be wrong and I'm misreading this and he just made a bad choice to do the wrong thing for what he thought were the right reasons but were actually the wrong ones. Perhaps he still has a deep villain path ahead of him. His apparent capacity to ignobly defeat the Grysk leader and decide to re-form the Galactic Empire at the end of the 2011 novella I still haven't read would sort of imply that maybe? But... if he really is just doing all this to defeat the big bad both for the Empire and the Ascendancy why rebuild the Galactic Empire?? It has nothing to do with his goals as laid out in this series and especially not in the Ascendancy series. Maybe he'll have a turn where his obsession with order will take over his personality or something? Is Thrawn going to decide that interpersonal relationships and social interactions and politics are just the worst and decide to re-found the Empire in order to eliminate like... relationships and become the incel Emperor?  I don't see that really happening. This book goes out of its way to establish that, though he sucks at politics, he's a relatively nice guy who wants to help the people who are working hard under him. He likes, cares for, and gets along with children. I think this series and the Ascendancy series were written because they wanted us to keep enjoying Thrawn and not really think about how he's a basically a fascist super-villain who has bad motivations and Zahn, or whomever, didn't really think about the larger implications on the Star Wars universe, or the historical parallels, or Thrawn's role--now made larger outside these books and author--in it. It doesn't really make this book on its own worse and it doesn't touch the Ascendancy series, which is great, in isolation. But it does sort of suck for thinking about these books as parts of the larger Star Wars universe. I dunno, I usually don't do that, but all the little tie-ins that are in this book and especially the series made me, so now I have to write this rant. <br/><br/>Also, the Grysks barely fit in this story. They're a red herring in a bunch of ways but also they actually don't have much to do with the main plot and this book would work better without them or with much less of them. <br/><br/>That said, I'm enough of a fanboy that I laughed out-loud when Thrawn sicced Vader on Krennic so I must recommend. <br/><br/></spoiler>",,,1,1

Thrawn: Alliances, which marks the second Thrawn novel in the rebooted Star Wars post-Disney universe is a good book. Like Zahn's other works it stands out as being way better than the majority of Star Wars novels. But this is also the worst of them. That doesn't make it bad, I still enjoyed it, but it just doesn't stand up to his previous books, even the last Thrawn novel. <br/><br/>I don't like Episodes 1-3. I'll put that up front. Clone Wars (the animated series x2) was fine. Rebels is ok. I don't have an irrational hatred for Anakin Skywalker as a character beyond the fact that it's very hard to separate portrayals of him as a hero from the fact that he goes on to just... murder a ton of children. But whatever, that wasn't what bothered me. He just was an irritating character in this novel, in about half of which he unexpectedly stars. <br/><br/>Perhaps this impression was compounded by the fact that I listened to the audiobook, which is usually great for Star Wars novels. I do not recommend the experience this time. The narrator does the voices of Anakin and Padme spot on from Episode 2, which means half the book is listening to whiny teen voices. Like it made me want to dive into the book and strangle both characters. It wasn't distracting, because it was spot on from the films, it was just those characters and you were unable to forget that they Like Totally Sounded Like That in the movies and it was the worst. <br/><br/>But then on top of that, the characters are exactly like they were in Episode 2, boringly self-interested, overly fraught, acting with little care to the consequences of their actions. I get it... those were the characters... but they were bad characters in the film and Zahn manages to capture their terribleness completely accurately... which just isn't great. <br/><br/>Honestly, it was all a little unnecessary. The historical bits didn't feel like they served much of a purpose except to maybe try and patch up some plot holes in the larger universe? It wasn't a particularly interesting B story, precisely because we know exactly what's going to happen to all these characters now and there are no stakes. The 'modern' portions with Vader and Thrawn playing off each other were far more interesting. The tactics are interesting. Trying to track what Thrawn is thinking is interesting. All of it was interesting. That said, even there it didn't quite rise to the level of his previous works. If you like Star Wars or Thrawn, pick this up I guess (but not the audiobook). But don't expect Heir to the Empire, because this ain't that. ",,,2,0

All the style is here and it's clear that, for the author, this was an intensely personal book (see: https://whatever.scalzi.com/2017/11/14/the-big-idea-k-c-alexander-2/?amp). And l have to say the intent, to portray a character with PTSD is well executed. As a writer, it feels like the author set out to do something very specific and accomplished it really well. <br/><br/>But as a reader, I found this book frustrating. Often the extra long action scenes didn't feel like they moved characterization or plot forward, and the parts of the book that did often felt all too short. As a result it is really hard to not feel like I just finished a long, well written, action-infused cul-de-sac. And perhaps this frustration is by design. But it didn't feel necessary.<br/><br/>I don't really know how to rate this as a result. Did the writer accomplish a difficult task, executed it well, did something different and rare and did it with style? Absolutely. It's clear that the reader is supposed to feel frustration *by design*. Did I enjoy reading it as someone coming into this book looking for a novel with a legible strong clear plot that I could hook into? Not really. I didn't have any problem with it stylistically. It's bleeding great cyberpunk style, and I enjoyed the hell out of all of that. But the substance just felt lightweight to me.<br/><br/>If you liked the first book, you'll likely enjoy the ride of this book. It absolutely kept me engaged. But it doesn't catch me the same way.",,,1,0

It's a fun sci-fi book when taken on that angle instead of as a cyberpunk work, and has some cool ideas. As a read it gets especially fast moving towards the end, and in comparison it looks like the first half could have used one more edit. The result is that it feels a little short on spirit.",,,1,0

This volume really solidifies the problem, that there's only one story they have to tell *about* the concept and it was complete in Vol. 1. Every volume since has just been treading water in flashback land. The gangsters and cops plot here reads like a tribute to Brubaker, which is fine though not as well executed, but sort of beside the point. The question posed at the end of Vol. 1: what happens when the cure for the Beauty means you live but you live looking like a scifi monster? It remains unanswered here.

But reading volume 2 makes me wonder: perhaps it didn't? There is much unnecessary in Vol 2, and little necessary; with it being short on core story and--considering the pages of difficult to read in-universe handwritten notes--short on art as well. The book mostly feels like it is treading water, a lot of time spent on a monster hunt that fills some interesting world building in about the titular Department, but is also filled with characters who are shitty in entirely unnecessary ways. The book has an ending twist it seems to want us to believe, but for which it has given no real support or setup.<br/><br/>The whole setting feels incredibly like one very good new idea wrapped around badly taken notes from The Unwritten, Fables and The Illuminati Trilogy, with its main innovation being to suck any fun out of the proceedings for a seriousness that seemed useful in Vol. 1 but now seems like a bad plastic wrap in Vol. 2. The result is this book, which feels like it world be more interesting as part of a Wikipedia of this universe than as a narrative. <br/><br/>It feels like every generation might need its own ""what if enough people believing in a story makes it real"" book and this is the latest, as heavily infused with Our Times as its predecessors. But I'm not enjoying this take. If you want a comic that does this right, pick up The Unwritten. I promise that, at the very least, you'll have more fun.",true,,1,0

However it is the most fresh-from-failure of his works, the narrative apparently completes before the end of the Trump administration and in the midst of the national failure on COVID that his main characters so desperately tried to prevent. It's an important book in that it lays bare what we thought we knew: that the US failed to do everything it could and should have done, and illustrates it with the facts and personalities who tried desperately to force things otherwise. <br/><br/>It's relatively fast turn around also gives the reader the clearest insight into Lewis's techniques as an author and journalist, his curiosity with anti-protagonists are inescapable here, where Presidents are minor characters, no one wants to take credit for their work, and a coalition of the brilliant blare warnings unheeded into the night.<br/><br/>Sadly it offers no sure solutions, just an indisputably broken system, the stakes higher than ever, and a cast of characters who find slight comfort in others who have been fighting and failing this fight for decades. He tries to find some light at the end, but I couldn't help but feel that it is just the cycle starting again. An excellent but depressing read. ",,,1,0

A very interesting take on the core concept thus far. But I'm also reading this and thinking maybe it's a little too early or a little too late for this story? Perhaps that feeling will go away with its conclusion. I don't know, the difficulty is perhaps part of what makes it good. That said, I also can't help but think that this concept has been an increasingly common story conceit lately and therefore I end up comparing it with the two comics that have also taken on this concept effectively: The Unwritten (see: [b:The Unwritten, Vol. 1: Tommy Taylor and the Bogus Identity|6471550|The Unwritten, Vol. 1  Tommy Taylor and the Bogus Identity|Mike Carey|https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327887253l/6471550._SX50_.jpg|6662356] ) and Aleš Kot's run on Secret Avengers (See: [b:Secret Avengers, Volume 1: Let's Have a Problem|20898022|Secret Avengers, Volume 1  Let's Have a Problem|Aleš Kot|https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1416794917l/20898022._SY75_.jpg|40257744] ) and while neither are as conceptually serious, or--especially--topical, they were significantly more fun to read and had their own interesting impactful concepts and things to say. In fact, I count both among my top absolute favorite books specifically because of how and why they explore similar concepts. But perhaps I'm also just biased a bit because this illustration style isn't exactly for me. I know what they're going for and why and I understand it, but... like the story itself... It's good, but I'm not sure I enjoy it... yet. I'll keep giving it a try though and plan to pick up Volume 2. ",,,1,0

Ok. The novel is well written, but the plot is so much treading water. In the larger story this single book is a part of, this is basically one long justification, a convoluted twisty path to undue the larger galactic impact of Return of the Jedi. It manages to make everything accomplished going into the book pretty much undone by the end. Leia is one of the main characters and everything she ends up doing is basically a reversal. I was hoping there would be a larger point then 'and this is why Leia was in the Resistance in episode 7', but there really isn't, and to be honest it does a poor job even justifying that. For all its promise of even explaining what the Resistance was, it doesn't do much of that either. Instead it gets bogged down in constantly trying to explain some rather awkwardly named political parties and trying to give them significance. If you really want the answers this book promises, you'd be better off reading a summery.",,,1,0

Someone with no experience of the comic book world could pick up the series and enjoy it greatly. However, they wouldn't get the full experience of Waid's effort without some knowledge of the superhero genre. <br/><br/>If you know anything of Waid's previous work (say, Kingdom Come), you know that he delights in taking heroes to the end of their rope. Irredeemable is no different. It is a book about heroes and their humanity, or lack of. <br/><br/>It's impossible to properly tell you about the dark masterpiece that is this narrative without ruining it. Just understand that Waid will take the superhero story and dissect it in a way that few others have succeed in doing. <br/><br/>Read it all the way to the end. The conclusion to the story (not in this volume, but available in smaller collections) is one of the most satisfying I've ever read.",,,1,0

Meticulous, fascinating, disturbing. <br/><br/>In some ways it might be best to go into this book with no knowledge of what is within, which is how I did it. To be so thoroughly introduced to the internal voice and thought process of a character who is often used to exemplify inhumanity, and whose acts are well deserving of revilement, is to repudiate dehumanization, generalization and demonization. Even our worst enemies are still people; their thoughts and motivations are not uniform, and may not even be what we suspect. Even the clearest of evils does not have the clearest of sources. <br/><br/>Jarett Kobek writes a well-researched historical fiction <spoiler>from the point of view of one of the 9/11 plane hijackers, centered on the idea that for Atta the attack was as much an architectural statement as a religious one.</spoiler> Few books will make you think more.

While the plot has clearly been thought out, the mechanics of the writing are still rough.

Little did I know that it would set the standard for readable, engrossing, and superb fantasy.<br/><br/>Nix does world-building in a way that reads effortlessly and opens up a million windows into a unique and fascinating universe. When I discovered it was part of a trilogy I was thrilled.<br/><br/>This is the first book in the series, focused on a world split in half, on one side of the wall is a relatively normal early-modern nation, on the other side a kingdom of magic. In this novel we follow the titular character as she walks from one world to another. The plot runs at just the right speed, building into a fantastic story written flawlessly.<br/><br/>Most novels exploring a unique world fall into the trap of spending too much time trying to explain how it all works. Nix doesn't make that mistake, instead he imbues the work with a wonderful narrative flow, the likes of which I've rarely seen in any genre. The same is true in his characters, who build and grow naturally in the work, resulting in some of the more memorable literary personalities I've encountered. The result is an almost addictive read.<br/><br/>There are few books I can recommend more highly than Sabriel. You should read it. Right now.",,,1,1

The concept doesn't stray far from my experience of Joe Hill's previous work, nor do the themes, but that doesn't stop it from being a well put together story that, after the one-third or half-way point, makes for an engrossing read.

Highly enjoyable, but strange. <br/><br/>The weird part is just how specifically the book feels aimed at my interests. I honestly didn't think that there were many other geeks with the specific combination of love for design, marketing, books (printed and electronic), fonts, code, Google and general hackery, but there must be, because this book is steeped in all of those topics and more, bringing them together in one wonderful mystery and then unwrapping it all before our eyes. <br/><br/>The book is solid, well written and fun. The only major flaw is that the pacing occasionally gets bogged down as Sloan goes deeper with her characters. The characters are all interesting, though (with the exception of the protagonist) they tend to be there as representatives of single specific geeky interests. As a result, the tangents are neither bad nor uninteresting, it just means that the flow can be inconsistent.<br/><br/>All that being said, it's absolute love with every subject it touches upon more than makes up for its flaws. A great read. If you're interests are anywhere close to the ones in the list above, pick it up. ",,,1,1

Scalzi takes events from past novels (mostly the previous book in the series) and re-frames them through a new character. Zoe's voice is strong and her characterization excellent. The same is true of her group of friends. In that it succeeds. However, having read the previous books, there is simply too much repeated here. <br/><br/>The narrative is fragmentary (out of necessity, because there is so much to the main plot that Zoe doesn't witness) and the only two fragments that truly add value come towards the end, significant events that only Zoe (instead of the triad of previous protagonists) witnessed. These sections shine. However, in order to make the novel stand on its own, Scalzi ends up treating us to far too much exposition, the beginning of the book is fairly weighed down with explanation and back story, mostly told to us, mostly repeating events we've already seen in previous novels with not enough extra added that they would stand on their own. <br/><br/>It's a shame that both the strong stories also can't stand on their own either, as this novel would have been far better as a self-contained set of shorts from Zoe's perspective. All the ingredients are there, but instead  it all comes out a bit too loose to be a great novel but still too connected to be a good collection of shorts. <br/><br/>If you loved the series so far, go for it, otherwise it is likely not worth picking up.

It's too bad that (failing an unlikely pop adaptation into another format like film) the soft-ish nature of the SF (mostly abandoned for hard SF, like Karl Schroeder or outright Sci-Fi Fantasy of the Star Wars variety), the extensive length of most works and the regular slower-than-average start to his narrative arcs will keep his work from gaining the mainstream acceptance it deserves. <br/><br/>Like all of Banks's books (especially from the Culture series) Hydrogen Sonata starts off with a bang of an inciting incident, moves sort of lazily for a while with a great deal of exposition and an initial sluggish rising action while all the plans are hatched and pieces moved into place. About 20% of the way through the novel his rising action finally catches and begins immense acceleration. Past that point it takes off at great speed, with good humor, great plotting and significant pull. Once caught in the gravity well of the primary conflict, things move excitingly apace and the book becomes difficult to put down.<br/><br/>That first 20% is, like most of Banks's works, the greatest obstacle, especially to a new reader because it cannot easily be skipped (like say, The Lord of the Rings' ridiculous initial world-building exercise). The exposition is necessary to entry in Banks's increasingly complex universe of the Culture, especially because it allows the reader to move through the subsequent action of the narrative without ever having to slow down. Still, it's a shame because the average reader will never make it through this portion of the novel, putting it down never to pick it up again. <br/><br/>Don't be that reader. The Hydrogen Sonata is yet another excellent entry in the series, perhaps in the top 3 in terms of quality, and well worth the wait. <br/><br/>Like all Culture novels, reading previous entries is not required but will greatly enhance the experience. <br/>",,,1,0

There are few surprises here, and the question of what the book's heroes would do on 9/11 pulls through some mediocre prose and overdone foreshadowing.<br/><br/>However, at about 3/4ths through the book, something happens. The characters gain depth. As soon as you hit that, the book becomes almost impossible to put down. You now care about the once relatively shallow superheroes. The fact that you know what is to come doesn't change the fact that you now really want to know what is going to happen to them. Unfortunately, though the ending ties everything up, it feels somewhat lackluster. <br/><br/>The book is decent overall, however, it feels as if the characters' depth is almost an accident. However, if you like stories about Superheroes you should pick this book up. ",,,1,0
