"Specifically, this was a massive criminal fraud scheme, something akin to a giant counterfeiting operation, in which banks mass-produced extremely risky, low-quality subprime mortgages and with lightning-quick efficiency sold them off to institutional sucker-investors as highly rated AAA bonds. The hot potato game targeted unions, pension funds, and government-backed mortgage companies like Fannie Mae on the secondary market. It was a modern take on the Rumpelstiltskin fairy tale. Big banks took great masses of straw (i.e., the risky home loans of the poor, undocumented, and unemployed) and spun it, factory style, into gold (i.e., AAA-rated securities). They used a technique called securitization that allowed banks and mortgage lenders to take vast pools of home loans belonging to underemployed janitors and immigrants and magically convert them into investments that were ostensibly as safe as Microsoft corporate bonds or the sovereign debt of Luxembourg, but more lucrative than either. The sudden introduction of these magic mortgage bonds into the marketplace pushed most every major institutional investor in the world to suddenly become consumed with the desire to lend money to American home borrowers, even if they didn’t know to whom exactly they were lending or how exactly these borrowers were qualifying for their home loans. As a result of this lunatic process, houses in middle- and lower-income neighborhoods from Fresno to the Jersey Shore became jammed full of new home borrowers, millions and millions of them, who in many cases were not equal to the task of making their monthly payments. The situation was tenable so long as housing prices kept rising and these teeming new populations of home borrowers could keep their heads above water, selling or refinancing their way out of trouble if need be. But the instant the arrow began tilting downward, this rapidly expanding death-balloon of phony real estate value inevitably had to—and did—explode. In other words, it was a Ponzi scheme, no different than the Bernie Madoff caper, only executed on an exponentially huger scale. The scheme depended upon the ability of a nexus of large financial companies to factory-produce and sell these magic home loans fast enough, and in big enough numbers, to continually keep more money coming in than going out.",The Divide: American Injustice in the Age of the Wealth Gap,Matt Taibbi,B00EBRUB02,,yellow,,location,729,2015-05-27 04:56:00+00:00,

It was the very definition of systemic corruption, but curiously, despite what looked like mountains of evidence, almost nobody with any connection to the crisis was even threatened with criminal prosecution. For instance, court filings showed that Bank of America—a Covington & Burling client, remember—had teamed up with the unscrupulous, now-defunct mortgage lender Countrywide to sell more than a billion dollars’ worth of questionable loans to Fannie and Freddie.

One of the favorite targets of that fraud scheme was government and the taxpayer. These companies, along with their bankers, loved more than anything to sell worthless mortgage bonds to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-backed housing agencies.

"And in one such skinny file was the data for a second home loan to O.J. This was long after both the criminal and civil trials following the murder of Nicole Simpson had run their courses. So when WaMu’s chief legal officer, Fay Chapman, saw the loan, she flipped out, knowing Simpson had a $33.5 million judgment against him and couldn’t possibly afford to buy property. “When I asked how we could possibly foreclose on [the loan], they said there was a letter in the file from O. J. Simpson,” she said.

"Now, someone at WaMu sold this preposterous loan into a pool of mortgages that was bought by investors all around the world. Among the buyers of such loans was Stichting Pensioenfonds ABP, a Dutch state pension fund, which ultimately sued JPMorgan Chase, which by then had acquired WaMu in a state-aided shotgun wedding. The Dutch plaintiffs described the Simpson loan in their suit. That same year the fund was forced to cut pensions for some three million workers by 0.5 percent. Selling that loan into a securitized pool that would be marketed everywhere wasn’t just fraud, it was as bad as grinding horsemeat into hot dogs and sending them by the truckload to supermarkets around the world. There were tens of thousands of cases just as insidious as the Simpson case, and each one of them was a truly despicable criminal fraud.

"Antonio got two years of probation and 180 hours of community service. Nobody is saying people like this aren’t guilty, or that there shouldn’t be a punishment for deceiving the government and for making taxpayers pay the medical bills for her and her husband’s three kids. But if her crime gets punished, someone else committing the same crime has to receive the same punishment. This stuff isn’t brain surgery. But there just aren’t cases of bankers or mortgage lenders doing jail time or lengthy community service stints for dumping bad loans into mortgage pools. Nobody from a bank or a ratings agency is losing his or her kids or housing because he or she sold or helped sell bad loans to, say, King County, Washington, or the Iowa Student Loan Liquidity Corporation. It just doesn’t happen. The method for dealing with that kind of offender increasingly involves fines and noncriminal sanctions. Responsibility for the fraud redounds to the institution, which takes the punishment. The only thing that changes is that as the economy stagnates more and more, and the wealth divide gets bigger, it becomes less and less possible for law enforcement to imagine the jail-or-garbage option for the Collateral Consequences crowd, and more and more possible to imagine it for an ever-expanding population of Everyone Else.",The Divide: American Injustice in the Age of the Wealth Gap,Matt Taibbi,B00EBRUB02,,yellow,,location,6285,2015-05-27 04:56:00+00:00,

"public utility of throwing a few midlevel peons from a bank like HSBC in jail versus collecting 1.9 billion actual dollars. What’s better, they ask, for the state? What’s better for the people? With some regulatory agencies like the SEC, the settlements they collect go directly to victims. Within the walls of those agencies, the calculus starts to feel exactly like the math employed by any private civil law firm, where you’re weighing the possibility of getting nothing at all versus the chance, today, at $100 million or $200 million. So given these factors, prosecutors will tell you that these massive financial settlements, and the binding deferred prosecution agreements that theoretically give the government enormous leverage over these offender firms, are not only good deals, they’re great deals.

"And in all but a very few of these cases, the narrative is exactly the same. There is somehow just enough evidence to extract hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars in penalties, but somehow not quite enough evidence to force any individual to do so much as a day in jail. Every single time, the state lands itself right in that oddly enormous sweet spot between spectacular leverage (to extract fines) and no leverage at all (to hand down criminal penalties). This makes the “not enough evidence” defense either a total lie or the most unbelievable coincidence in history. In one case, maybe.

"How many bodies has the state even assigned to gather evidence for these difficult cases? How much money has it been willing to spend for that kind of justice? It never put together a task force to concentrate on this corruption, never had a coordinated strategy. In fact, it barely even studied the problem. Fun fact: When the economy crashed in 2008, the federal government formed an investigatory group to look into the causes. That Financial Crisis Inquiry Committee was given a budget of $9.8 million. Committee chairman Phil Angelides acidly noted that this was “roughly one-seventh of the budget of Oliver Stone’s Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps.” Meanwhile, that same year the federal drug enforcement budget leaped from $13.275 billion to $15.278 billion. That meant that just the increase in the national drug enforcement budget for the year of the biggest financial crisis since the Depression was roughly two hundred times the size of the budget for the sole executive branch effort at formally investigating the causes of financial corruption.",The Divide: American Injustice in the Age of the Wealth Gap,Matt Taibbi,B00EBRUB02,,yellow,,location,6346,2015-05-27 04:56:00+00:00,

"Why go after intangible rewards like political optics when you can have, bird-in-hand-style, $2 billion right now, without even risking the possibility of losing? That’s an argument one can have. It might even have, who knows, some merit. But to even have that argument, one has to admit what it concedes. And what it concedes is that there’s a concrete difference between how we treat an individual who commits fraud within the structure of a giant multinational company with a lot of settlement money lying around, and how we treat, say, an ordinary broke person who commits welfare or unemployment fraud. If you choose to take the money over and over again from the Wall Street crowd while the welfare moms keep getting jail and community service, now suddenly you’ve institutionalized the imbalance. From there, it’s not long before the tail starts wagging the dog. A massive, unconscious tendency toward reverse profiling occurs. Because, thanks to all these various factors, executives from giant multinationals simply don’t end up in the prison population, law enforcement soon starts to operate on the reverse principle, that those huge companies are not the places where jailable crimes take place.

And the record seems to suggest that we can do most to protect smaller, unsophisticated investors by focusing more attention on smaller entities. In other words, we’ve got a limited budget, and there’s a bigger degree of difficulty in going after big banks with powerful lawyers. Therefore the SEC shouldn’t give in to the “temptation” of tangling with big banks because, rhetorically speaking, those shots are harder to make.

"A credit default swap is just a bet on an outcome. It works like this: Two bankers get together and decide to bet on whether or not a homeowner is going to default on his $300,000 home loan. Banker A, betting against the homeowner, offers to pay Banker B $1,000 a month for five years, on one condition: if the homeowner defaults, Banker B has to pay Banker A the full value of the home loan, in this case $300,000. So Banker B has basically taken 5–1 odds that the homeowner will not default. If he does not default, Banker B gets $60,000 over five years from Banker A.

"It used to be that, in line with the Basel Accords, banks had to have at least one dollar in reserve for every eight they lent; the CDS was a way around that. Say Bank A is holding $10 million in A-minus-rated IBM bonds. It goes to Bank B and makes a deal: we’ll pay you $50,000 a year for five years and in exchange, you agree to pay us $10 million if IBM defaults sometime in the next five years—which of course it won’t, since IBM never defaults. If Bank B agrees, Bank A can then go to the Basel regulators and say, “Hey, we’re insured if something goes wrong with our IBM holdings. So don’t count that as money we have at risk. Let us lend a higher percentage of our capital, now that we’re insured.” It’s a win-win. Bank B makes, basically, a free $250,000. Bank A, meanwhile, gets to lend out another few million more dollars, since its $10 million in IBM bonds is no longer counted as at-risk capital.","Griftopia: Bubble Machines, Vampire Squids, and the Long Con That Is Breaking America",Matt Taibbi,B003F3FJS2,,yellow,,location,1663,2015-05-29 04:56:00+00:00,

"Here’s how shorting works. Say you’re a hedge fund and you think the stock of a certain company—let’s call it International Pimple—is going to decline in value. How do you make money off that knowledge? First, you call up a securities lender, someone like, say, Win Neuger, and ask if he has any stock in International Pimple. He says he does, as much as you want. You then borrow a thousand shares of International Pimple from Neuger, which let’s say is trading at 10 that day. So that’s $10,000 worth of stock. Now, in order to “borrow” those shares from Neuger, you have to give him collateral for those shares in the form of cash. For his trouble, you have to pay him a slight markup, usually 1–2 percent of the real value. So perhaps instead of sending $10,000 to Neuger, you send him $10,200. Now you take those thousand shares of International Pimple, you go out onto the market, and you sell them. Now you’ve got $10,000 in cash again. Then, you wait for the stock to decline in value. So let’s say a month later, International Pimple is now trading not at 10 but at 7½. You then go out and buy a thousand shares in the company for $7,500. Then you go back to Win Neuger and return his borrowed shares to him; he returns your $10,000 and takes the stock back. You’ve now made $2,500 on the decline in value of International Pimple, less the $200 fee that Neuger keeps.

How they accomplished that feat was somewhat complicated. First, the Fed put up the money to cover the collateral calls against Neuger from Goldman and other banks. Then the Fed set up a special bailout facility called Maiden Lane II (named after the tiny street in downtown Manhattan next to the New York Federal Reserve Bank), which it then used to systematically buy up all the horseshit RMBS assets Neuger and his moronic “ten cubed”–chasing employees had bought up with all their billions in collateral over the years.","Griftopia: Bubble Machines, Vampire Squids, and the Long Con That Is Breaking America",Matt Taibbi,B003F3FJS2,,yellow,,location,2048,2015-05-29 04:56:00+00:00,

We paid for this instead of a generation of health insurance, or an alternative energy grid, or a brand-new system of roads and highways. With the $13-plus trillion we are estimated to ultimately spend on the bailouts, we could not only have bought and paid off every single subprime mortgage in the country (that would only have cost $1.4 trillion), we could have paid off every remaining mortgage of any kind in this country—and still have had enough money left over to buy a new house for every American who does not already have one. But we didn’t do that, and we didn’t spend the money on anything else useful, either. Why? For a very good reason. Because we’re no good anymore at building bridges and highways or coming up with brilliant innovations in energy or medicine.

"In other words, the lenders were paying brokers to steer unsuspecting borrowers into more expensive loans that they had less of a chance of being able to repay. From the lenders’ perspective the economics were simple: because of higher interest rates and fees on subprime loans, they could resell them for a higher profit than they would earn on prime loans, and so were willing to pay brokers to generate more. The worse the mortgage was for the borrower, the more profitable it was in the short term for everyone else.

"Designing site architecture Although site architecture — the creation of structure and flow in a website’s topical hierarchy — is typically the territory of information architects and is created without assistance from a company’s internal content team, its impact on search engine rankings, particularly in the long run, is substantial, thus making it wise to follow basic guidelines of search friendliness. The process itself should not be overly arduous, if you follow this simple protocol: List all of the requisite content pages (blog posts, articles, product detail pages, etc.). Create top-level navigation that can comfortably hold all of the unique types of detailed content on the site. Reverse the traditional top-down process by starting with the detailed content and working your way up to an organizational structure capable of holding each page. Once you understand the bottom, fill in the middle. Build out a structure for subnavigation to sensibly connect top-level pages with detailed content. In small sites, there may be no need for this level, whereas in larger sites, two or even three levels of subnavigation may be required. Include secondary pages such as copyright, contact information, and other nonessentials. Build a visual hierarchy that shows (to at least the last level of subnavigation) each page on the site. Figure 6-7 shows an example of a structured site architecture.",The Art of SEO (Theory in Practice),"Eric Enge, Stephan  Spencer, Jessie  Stricchiola, and Rand Fishkin",B007IJW3YM,,yellow,,location,3887,2015-06-27 04:56:00+00:00,

After a few visits, she gave me an extensive test of over 500 questions called an MMPI, which stands for the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory. The creators of this test designed it to give a therapist a fairly accurate breakdown of a person’s personality. If questions are answered truthfully, it can tell a lot about a person, including their gender identity. However, the questions on the test relating to gender identity are so blatantly obvious that a person could easily manipulate their answers to show the identity they want the therapist to see.

It would demand centralized control of key economic sectors, massive state investment in carbon capture and sequestration, and global coordination on a scale never seen before’ – a scenario that can be conjured up in some theoretical hemisphere of the mind but not promoted or implemented in the real world, because the forces stacked against it are so stupefyingly strong.

Emancipation was granted on a quid pro quo basis.

For Jews in post-Napoleonic Prussian Poland, as for Indo-Europeans in colonial southeast Asia, citizenship was granted on a case-by-case basis, the result of a rigorous yet arbitrary examination procedure.

Political citizenship is granted to all adults at the time of state creation as an expression of a populist sentiment and a legitimization of the overthrow of nonrepresentative colonial rule. As Chatterjee writes of India, nationalists asserted that the entire people had been nationalized, that is, vested with a distinct and unifying Indianness. The nation, having been feminized by the colonial power, was to be emancipated in one fell swoop.36 This conceptual framework is of benefit for the study of Zionism, for it helps account for the ZO’s early granting of voting rights to women (at the Second Congress of 1898, at time when only New Zealand had national female suffrage) and the passion with which all but ultra-Orthodox members of the Yishuv advocated women’s suffrage after World War I.",Colonialism and the Jews (The Modern Jewish Experience),"Ethan B.

"Some had more to work with than others, and that diversity of inherent and immutable ability was important and, they believed, understudied. Without a way to test for superior ability, identifying it in students was haphazard and unscientific, and so was public education in general. If intellectual capacity were a single genetic trait—and they believed it was—then it should be testable. Terman set about making it so, adapting a French intelligence test used to identify students who were falling behind. Against the explicit warning of the test’s author, Alfred Binet, Terman and his Stanford team reformatted it into a measure of inborn general intelligence, expressed in a single number, the ratio of “mental age” to actual age multiplied by 100.10 From there Terman and company were off to the races, marketing “Stanford-Binet” tests, estimating the IQs of famous dead people, and looking for geniuses.","Palo Alto: A History of California, Capitalism, and the World",Malcolm Harris,B0B38T91QJ,,yellow,,location,1888,2024-07-10 04:56:00+00:00,

Together they made their lead author a star in psychology. Terman became department chair in 1922, and the president of the American Psychological Association the next year. In 1925, his royalties from books and tests were around $11,000—over $180,000 in 2022 money, enough for him to subsidize his own research and, later, his son’s.12 Great things, as the phrenologist peddler foretold.","Palo Alto: A History of California, Capitalism, and the World",Malcolm Harris,B0B38T91QJ,,yellow,,location,1907,2024-07-10 04:56:00+00:00,

SAGE stations had computers that connected across the country by modem and telephone line, a first. The system was a PR coup for IBM, which produced a 12-minute advertising video called “On Guard! The Story of SAGE,” a truly exceptional piece of Cold War propaganda, complete with Mom and Dad standing watch over their sleeping daughter: the parental dyad, a SAGE system of the home.xx According to SAGE engineer Lester Earnest, it also didn’t work—at all.xxi No one claims America ever used SAGE in action, but Earnest maintains that we never could have.

For another, ICBMs replaced bombers as the go-to nuclear delivery device, and those went above radar into space.

"a fable that capitalists adopted from the Stanford eco-racist anti-population milieu: the “tragedy of the commons.” In six pages published in the journal Science in December of 1968, the Stanford-trained ecologist Garrett Hardin asserted that the public “commons” was by its nature subject to abuse by maximizing actors. A bigot and cofounder of the anti-immigrant group FAIR, Hardin was worried about population specifically. “In a welfare state,” he begs the question, “how shall we deal with the family, the religion, the race, or the class (or indeed any distinguishable and cohesive group) that adopts overbreeding as a policy to secure its own aggrandizement?”18 One step away from neo-Nazism, this rhetoric wore the cloak of environmentalism during the Nixon years, but by the time of the Reagan administration, the musing philosophy paper that had no business in a scientific publication in the first place had ballooned to an existential truth that applied to public goods in general. As the economy advanced, the state had to “enclose” an increasing number of commons to make sure they weren’t misused, either by overexploitation or, just as concerning, underexploitation, since, as we know, capital is reluctant to enter new markets where it can’t protect its initial position.

"The way most major music-streaming subscription services actually pay is through a simpler mathematical scheme that works like this: The service puts all the money from all the people for a whole month into one big pool, and then splits that pool up according to the total streaming that happened that month. This scheme is called pro rata, from the Latin 'pro' meaning 'professional', and 'rata' meaning 'way to avoid having to print 400 million individual billing statements'.

"Thus, in system terms, the people who stream less control a smaller share of the payments, and the people who stream more control a larger share.

"On the whole, if more-active listeners listen to more-popular artists, then the pro rata scheme will be regressive in the economic (and social) sense, compared to the user-centric one, taxing the less-popular artists to consolidate wealth in the most-popular. Whereas if more-active listeners tend to listen to less-popular artists, then the pro rata scheme will be progressive, redistributing money from more-popular artists to less-popular ones. Thus this very basic question can be answered quantitatively by computing the average number of monthly streams per Spotify listener, and then calculating the average monthly total plays per artist of the artists played by listeners with fewer streams than that vs the ones with more. A ratio greater than 1.0 shows that pro rata is regressive, a ratio less than 1.0 shows that it’s progressive, and either way it does so without revealing any remotely-proprietary actual counts or averages. When I monitored it at Spotify, it hovered around 0.83. More-active-than-average listeners play artists who are, on average, 0.83x as popular as the artists played by less-active-than-average listeners. The averages vary considerably across countries, and a little bit over time, and thus the ratio varies minorly in both dimensions as well, but not in magnitude or direction.

"It tends to be singer-songwriterly, but some of it isn’t. It often sounds like its singers are musical fans, or at least think of modern musicals as a normal part of pop music. It’s alternative in the sense of not existing as function of the mainstream adult/commercial music apparatus. One of its pervasive lyrical themes is the idea of thinking of yourself as a character: as a villain or hero, as a protagonist or not a main character, as someone whose story will be told, as someone who thinks about their decisions as if their story might one day be told. It’s native to social media, because of course it is, but not allegiant to any specific brand. Its artists’ self-written Spotify bios usually go something like ‘hi. idk. maybe tomorrow I will delete this.’ And maybe they will, but until then we are allowed to witness the scene that has formed around their ambivalence. Melanie Martinez’s Pity Party is its immediate precursor, and Olivia Rodrigo’s Sour is its pop crossover, but MOTHICA’s plaintively harrowing ‘forever fifteen’ is its definition, to me: fighting depression as if not at all sure of victory, but victorious by definition of the song’s narrative perspective; made out of small musical parts but vast emotional depth; kid and not-kid selves looking at each other across a table strewn with pieces of a life.",You Have Not Yet Heard Your Favourite Song: How Streaming Changes Music,Glenn McDonald,B0CJ141VFW,,yellow,,location,2780,2024-09-09 04:56:00+00:00,

There’s a piece of it outside of a random business-school here in Cambridge where I live. The scary thing about the new music is that it doesn’t care if you know.

Neo-liberal capitalism doesn’t provide that. It doesn’t give music the economic support it humanely deserves, but that’s because it doesn’t make humane decisions. It makes market decisions, and those are not driven by social goals or moral truths, they’re driven by the unplanned and unforeseen interactions of micromotives and macrobehavior.

"getting a contract can be just the beginning; building up a fledgling union and making it strong enough to enforce that hard-won legal agreement can be another struggle in and of itself.

"Self-proclaimed “high-class stripper” Gypsy Rose Lee, one of the most famous burlesque entertainers of her day and a pioneer of the striptease, was also known to be a leftist and friend of labor. Often heard speaking at local union meetings, she was one of the only female members of the short-lived Burlesque Artists’ Association and helped orchestrate a three-day strike that shut down several New York City theaters in 1935. When the Minsky Brothers’ theater locked out its stagehands for asking for higher wages, Lee rallied two hundred burlesque dancers in a solidarity picket outside the theater. “Gypsy called out to the theater and asked for some pickets,” remembered former “burlesque striptease artist” Red Tova Halem. “All of us strippers put robes on over our G-strings” and “paraded outside the theater flashing passersby and shouting, ‘Don’t go in there, boys!” The strike was settled that night, and the stagehands got their raise. Halem, a Jewish woman whose high earnings as a stripper enabled her to help thirteen of her relatives escape Nazi Germany, later went on to work alongside legendary ILWU leader Harry Bridges and serve as a delegate for the Culinary Workers Local 923.",Fight Like Hell: The Untold History of American Labor,Kim Kelly,B09842KDCW,,yellow,,location,4100,2024-09-20 04:56:00+00:00,

"In 2018, Backpage, a classified advertising website that many sex workers used to screen clients and advertise their services, was shut down by the FBI. Only days later, the Stop Enabling Online Sex Trafficking Act (SESTA) and the Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act (FOSTA) were signed into law and immediately began to impact sex workers, rather than helping the trafficked people the law was allegedly written to protect. A 2020 Hacking/Hustling study authored by Danielle Blunt and Ariel Wolf with advisement from Naomi Lauren of Whose Corner Is It Anyway found that the law drastically reduced workers’ ability to screen clients, and post-SESTA/FOSTA, 99 percent of the sex workers they surveyed felt less safe. One respondent characterized it as “a bill that is aimed to stop sex trafficking but is making the sex work industry more dangerous.” The nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century reformers who went around trying to “save” fallen women are reborn anew in each generation of powerful elites who believe that they alone hold the answer to an age-old question that journalist Melissa Gira Grant articulates in her book Playing the Whore: The Work of Sex Work as having shifted from “What do we do about prostitution?” to “What do we do about prostitutes?”",Fight Like Hell: The Untold History of American Labor,Kim Kelly,B09842KDCW,,yellow,,location,4171,2024-09-20 04:56:00+00:00,
