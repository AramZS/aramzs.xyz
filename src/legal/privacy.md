This site does not track you in any identifiable way. It leverages the service "[Plausible](https://plausible.io/)" for analytics. Plausible is a privacy-friendly alternative to Google Analytics. It also does not collect any personal data. You can read Plausible's privacy policy [here](https://plausible.io/privacy).

At the time of update, there is no other tracking activated on this site. If you are tracked by any service other than Plausible on this domain, it is initiated by third parties without my knowledge or consent and you should report it to me immediately. Send me a [HAR](https://toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/har_analyzer/) file at the email address below.
