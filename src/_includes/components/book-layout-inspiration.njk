        This books page layout was replicated from the work of <a href="https://photogabble.co.uk/antilibrary/" target="_blank">Simon Dann</a>. That page was inspired by the books pages of
        <a href="https://daverupert.com/bookshelf/" target="_blank">Dave Rupert</a>,
        <a href="https://www.markllobrera.com/reading/years/2020/" target="_blank">Mark Llobrera</a>,
        <a href="https://annualbeta.com/bookshelf/" target="_blank">SÃ¸ren Birkemeyer</a> and
        <a href="https://derekshirk.com/reads/" target="_blank">Derek Shirk</a>. They originally got the idea for a books page from
        <a href="https://maggieappleton.com/library" target="_blank">Maggie Appleton</a> and her Antilibrary. The first version of this page was inspired by
        <a href="https://www.coxchapman.com/books" target="_blank">Cox Chapman's Books page</a>. I was further hooked on a homepage for my own book activity by <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2020/04/15/library-json/" target="_blank">the library.json proposal by Tom Critchlow</a>.
