Here's a list of weird and fun websites that I've worked on, either for myself or others. 

## Site List

- [Song Obsessed](https://songobsessed.com) - A site that lets you find out what songs I'm obsessed with and listen to them within a Progressive Web App that combines [HTMX](https://htmx.org/) and 11ty static pages to create a persistent listening experience. 
- [Context Center](https://context.center) - A site for building lists of research, sources, and reference pages on different topics. 
- [Fight With Tools](https://aramzs.github.io) My engineering blog.
- [Fight with Tools.dev](https://fightwithtools.dev/) - A site for active note-taking on personal software development projects. 
- [Hack Text](https://hacktext.com/) - A site for writing about games and interactive experiences.
