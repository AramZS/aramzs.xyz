Going down the rabbit hole is in reference to Alice's adventures in wonderland and how every time I go debugging I feel as though I am falling down a very deep rabbit hole.

Popping on a blue dress and some [programming socks](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/programming-socks) to drop down a rabbit hole isn't mandatory, but it's also not entirely frowned against.
