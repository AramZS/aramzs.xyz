Richard Saul Wurman — the person who coined the term “information architect”, in his legendary book “Information Anxiety” wrote :

> “Information may be infinite, however… the organization of information is finite as it can only be organized by LATCH: Location, Alphabet, Time, Category, or Hierarchy. I’ve tried a thousand times to find other ways to organize, but I always end up using one of these five.”
