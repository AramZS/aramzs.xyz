"The belief that certain developments are impossible to avoid; determinism"

- [Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/inevitabilism)

> "These are some big names in the tech world, all framing the conversation in a very specific way. Rather than “is this the future you want?”, the question is instead “how will you adapt to this inevitable future?”. Note also the threatening tone present, a healthy psychological undercurrent encouraging you to go with the flow, because you’d otherwise be messing with scary powers way beyond your understanding."
