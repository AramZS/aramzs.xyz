`growthStage:` can be any of `stub, budding, seedling, evergreen`

- 👩‍🌾 [_Stubs_](/stubs/) are placeholders for pages I will be publishing soon.
- 📓 _Ephemeral_ for point in time updates that will likely not be updated such as Journal entries
- 🌱 _Seedlings_ are rough and early ideas, they need further work and are likely to change often
- 🌿 _Budding_ are ideas I've cleaned up and clarified. May still need refinement.
- 🌳 _Evergreen_ are ideas that I have invested a lot of work in. They are in a finished state and unlikely to change over time.

This hierarchy and its descriptions are entirely pulled from [Photogabble.co.uk](https://photogabble.co.uk/glossary/growth/).
