`growthStage:` can be any of `stub, budding, seedling, evergreen`

- Stubs are placeholders for pages I will be publishing soon.
- Seedlings are rough and early ideas, they need further work and are likely to change often
- Buddings are ideas I've cleaned up and clarified. May still need refinement.
- Evergreens are ideas that I have invested a lot of work in. They are in a finished state and unlikely to change over time.

This hierarchy and its descriptions are entirely pulled from [Photogabble.co.uk](https://photogabble.co.uk/glossary/growth/).
