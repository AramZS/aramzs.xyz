> When I envision the web, I picture an infinite expanse of empty space that stretches as far as the eye can see. It's full of fertile soil, but no seeds have taken root. That is, except for about an acre of it.
  -  Molly White, [[We can have a different web]]

The future of the internet seems up in the air. Not just because it is being consumed by rotting bemoliths but because the internet is part of our every-day life, our politics, our scoiaty, our communities and our frendships and all of those seem at risk. 

These things are connected. As we face down an endless series of political, social, and medical disasters on a melting planet there is no doubt that the internet is deeply integrated into everything that is going both right and wrong.

Today, at the moment, [we are actively discussing how to build a future for our shared global telecommunications network](https://aramzs.xyz/lists/a-future-for-the-web/). This is very good. We need this discussion. We also need to acknowledge that the wide open platform for infinite data, innovation and communication isn't a shelter from the disaster, it *is* at the heart of everything we do. The day we could go back from that, even if we wanted to, is long gone. That means [rewilding the web](https://www.noemamag.com/we-need-to-rewild-the-internet/) isn't **just** a matter of a better internet. It's the matter of being part of the making of a better world. 

With the problem so large, how do we approach a solution? If we want to plant a forrest how do we grow the ground cover? 

De-abstract the internet. The internet seems big, huge, infinite. What is it really? It's wires, and waves (and occasionally, joking aside, [pipes](https://www.windsystemsmag.com/the-latest-advancements-in-submarine-cables-protection/)) all put to the purpose of connecting people to each other. The internet then is the series of connections between people, at a huge scale. Not everyone is connected to each other, but if you're on the internet, you're connecting to *someone*. So it isn't so much a world wide web, it's world wide **webs**. The future core of the internet, if it is going to be [humane](https://humanewebmanifesto.com/) and if we are going to be able to use it to do the essential work of surviving this century, is a series of linked routes that stick us all together. In many ways, it is people being able to get through to each other effectively.

This is what the webs need to accomplish, how to we make that happen? How do we improve not just our telecommunication platform but leverage it towards a better world for all participants? I don't think there is only one solution, I suspect I don't even have them all in mind, but I have one approach that is behind why I launched this particular website (and some others). 

The thing about webs is they are failure resistent, one strand falling won't take the whole thing down. They can take bad weather, you can punch a whole through them, but webs are also rebuilt regularly, they can fail and come back quickly. 

We need to think of our connections and how we transmit information to each other in the same way. We need to think about how an important message goes edge to edge without interference and how the most important messages can make it from web to web succesfully. We need to think about *links*. Not just in the literal sense. 

I think what really put this into sharp focus for me is the long death of Twitter. Twitter is still a platform where, for professional reasons, I'm quite active, but its biggest utility--directing me to information that I'm interested in or that is important to me--that's gone. 

So how do we replace this chunk of essential function in a way that's wild, and not contained by monopolies or monopolist-wannabes? We need to be able to support, amplify, and extend the reach of good works on our webs.

We need to rethink how amplification works without requiring big tech or even a steady internet connection. I think there's two categories that are really important to consider while building how we move forward: 

1. Amplification through cross-linking between individual entities and feeds is essentially rejuvenating for the web. 
2. We [can't](https://ahrefs.com/blog/link-rot-study/) [take the life of those links for granted](https://www.pewresearch.org/data-labs/2024/05/17/when-online-content-disappears/) and an essential part of this rejuvenation process is archiving links that are important enough to amplify. 

## Principles of Amplification for better webs

- Aggregation is amplification 
- In a post-Twitter world, reach requires coordination. 
- If it has to query a backend to load it will one day die. 
- Amplification is power, use it responsibly. 
- Massive replication of your own work is good. Massive aggregation between members of a community is even better. 
- Amplification is a method to build community
- You can check out your work on other platforms and take ownership.

## Principles of Archiving for better webs

- Using the web downloads it to your computer, you should get to keep it for your use 
- Kill the app. 
- Everyone should support the Internet Archive, but no one should pretend it is invulnerable. 
- Own your own archive. 
- Single points of failure destroy innovation.
- Anything that can't fit on its own offline drive will die.

Connecting to each other connects our audiences and is the only way out of the walled gardens that hurt us and our society. 

We need to think about how we [[ENTER]] the wild web TK.
