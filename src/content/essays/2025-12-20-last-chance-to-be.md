It's 2026 now and the challenge is to fail at what the mechanisms of power desire of you. Everywhere we are asked to be incurious, uncreative, forgiving of the powerful, and cruel to the powerless. 

In this time, and especially in America, the people in charge want you to imitate their worst behavior. There is pressure at almost every digital surface of interaction to step back into Plato's cave, where you can chain yourself to the wall and amuse yourself only with shadows of reality. 

I ask you to consider an alternative. 

We must prioritize humans, our community, the people around us and what they create. There's no future in shadows. There are no choices that can be made when chained to cave wall. 

We still have to function in the here and now, acknowledging that is just one part of taking the real world head on.
