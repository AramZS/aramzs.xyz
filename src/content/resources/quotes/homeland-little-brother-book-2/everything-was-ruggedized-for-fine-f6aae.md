  Everything was ruggedized for the fine, blowing dust, mostly through the
  simple expedient of sticking it in a ziplock bag, which is what I’d done with

  walking past me was holding the string for a gigantic helium balloon a hundred
  yards overhead, from which dangled a digital video camera. Also, the man
  holding the balloon was naked.
