  What happened was that Parthia’s architect fell in love with Cleopatra, whom
  he married in-game and gave his login credentials. But Cleopatra turned out to
  be a catfish, and the dude behind the account leaked Parthia’s source code.
  Anyone could copy Malcolm’s empire and rule over it themselves.
