  it is misleading to think of the study of technology’s impacts on people and
  societies as an investigation of a stand-alone physical device—wires,
  hardware, and software. Rather, the object of study is the device construed in
  terms of key social interdependencies, as responsible for its features,
  function, and impact as for its physical characteristics.
