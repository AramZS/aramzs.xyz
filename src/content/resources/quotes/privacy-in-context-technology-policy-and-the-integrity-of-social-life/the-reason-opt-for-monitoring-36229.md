  The reason I opt for monitoring and tracking instead is that surveillance is
  usually associated with a set of political assumptions; namely, that
  monitoring is performed “from above” as subjects of surveillance are monitored
  by those in authority or more powerful than them for purposes of behavior
  modification or social control as sought or determined by those conducting the
  surveillance. Although surveillance studies are an important neighboring
  field, my initial goal here is to describe a range of technology-based systems
  and practices (“socio-technical” systems) without simultaneously theorizing
  about the uses to which they are put.
