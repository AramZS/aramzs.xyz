  Ms. Petrova’s case is being watched by thousands of young, highly educated
  Russians who, like her, fled the country after Russia invaded Ukraine. It has
  also caught the attention of prominent figures in Russia’s political
  opposition who warn that, for the United States, delivering a dissident
  scientist to President Vladimir V. Putin would be crossing an especially
  foreboding line.
