  But old people usually seemed pretty embarrassed to bring up such matters
  right in front of young people. Probably because of the inherent implication
  that the world’s old people were ecological criminals. Who probably ought to
  be hauled into court by a transgenerational tribunal and tried for atrocities
  against the biosphere. Not that old people would ever allow this to happen,
  though. There were shitloads of old people still running everything all over
  the world, and they were in no hurry to give up their power, despite the
  grotesquely stupid things they’d done with it.
