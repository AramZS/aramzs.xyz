  If you lost everything, it didn’t really ease your pain much to know that
  other people, somewhere else, might be hurting even worse. People who wanted
  to judge your pain by your privileges were mean-spirited people—the kind of
  people who thought it must be big fun to be an invalid, as long as you were
  rich.
