  It had been pretty damned stupid to dry up the aquifers in West Texas, but it
  didn’t really compare in scale with the planet’s truly monumental ecoblunders.
  Slowly poisoning the finest cropland in China, Egypt, and India with too much
  salt from irrigation, for instance. Clear-cutting the jungles in Indonesia and
  Brazil. The spread of the Sahara.
