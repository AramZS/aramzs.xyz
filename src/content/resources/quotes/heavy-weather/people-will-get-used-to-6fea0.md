  People will get used to anything, yeah, if they’re young enough! People used
  to scream their heads off at the thought of dying of stupid shit like TB or
  cholera, now you don’t even raise your voice, you just make it your own little
  secret, and you keep watching TV until you drop dead discreetly on the couch.
  People just put up with living in hell! They just ignore it all, and they’re
  sure the world is always, always gonna get worse, and they don’t ever wanna
  hear about it, and they’re just grateful they’re not in the relocation camp.”
