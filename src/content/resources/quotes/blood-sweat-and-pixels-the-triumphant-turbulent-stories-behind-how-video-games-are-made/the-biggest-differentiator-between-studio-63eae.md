  “The biggest differentiator between a studio that creates a really
  high-quality game and a studio that doesn’t isn’t the quality of the team,”
  said one person who worked on Destiny. “It’s their dev tools. If you can take
  fifty shots on goal, and you’re a pretty shitty hockey player, and I can only
  take three shots on goal and I’m Wayne fucking Gretzky, you’re probably going
  to do better. That’s what tools are. It’s how fast can you iterate, how stable
  are they, how robust are they, how easy is it as a nontechnical artist to move
  a thing.”
