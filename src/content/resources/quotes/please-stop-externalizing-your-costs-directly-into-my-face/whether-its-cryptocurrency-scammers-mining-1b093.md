  Whether it’s cryptocurrency scammers mining with FOSS compute resources or
  Google engineers too lazy to design their software properly or Silicon Valley
  ripping off all the data they can get their hands on at everyone else’s
  expense… I am sick and tired of having all of these costs externalized
  directly into my fucking face. Do something productive for society or get the
  hell away from my servers. Put all of those billions and billions of dollars
  towards the common good before sysadmins collectively start a revolution to do
  it for you.
