  It's embarrassing, honestly, to witness this very clear attempt to control the
  narrative surrounding a film's critical and financial journey by capitalizing
  on the loudest, cruelest people online, all of whom are practically frothing
  at the mouth for the chance to unleash baseless, disgusting character
  assassinations on the person who is the only reason the film works at all. The
  dogwhistles are starting to sound like air raid sirens, and the hilarious
  irony is that the undeserved ire has only made her defenders more passionate.
  If Rachel Zegler has no defenders, it means I'm dead.
