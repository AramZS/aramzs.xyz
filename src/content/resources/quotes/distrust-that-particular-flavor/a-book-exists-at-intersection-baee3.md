  A book exists at the intersection of the author’s subconscious and the
  reader’s response. An author’s career exists in the same way. A writer worries
  away at a jumble of thoughts, building them into a device that communicates,
  but the writer doesn’t know what’s been communicated until it’s possible to
  see it communicated.
