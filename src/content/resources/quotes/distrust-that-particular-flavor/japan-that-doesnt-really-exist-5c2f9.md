  Japan that doesn’t really exist. A Japan of the mind, where even toenail
  clippers and plastic coat hangers possess a Zen purity: functional, minimal,
  reasonably priced. I would very much like to visit the Japan that Muji evokes.
  I would vacation there and attain a new serenity, smooth and translucent, in
  perfect counterpoint to natural fabrics and unbleached cardboard. My
  toiletries would pretend to be nothing more than what they are, and neither
  would I. (If Mujiland exists anywhere, it’s probably not in Japan. If
  anywhere, it may actually be here, in London.)
