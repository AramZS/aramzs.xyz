  Fascism always fails.

  It is destructive and it is awful and not everyone lives to see the other
  side, but it always, always fails. It takes work. It takes fighting back. It
  takes throwing punches. It takes doing whatever it takes to beat it back, to
  protect those that are most vulnerable from its many attacks. And through it
  all, it feels impossible that we will win.

  But we will.

  Two years after he wrote that letter, George Dale became Mayor of Muncie. His
  first act was to fire all the cops. Over the weeks and months that followed,
  he stripped the Klan from Muncie.

  George Dale lost so much in his battle against the Klan. A battle that must
  have felt so lonely and so difficult so often. A battle that cost him his
  home, his savings, and, for a time, his freedom. But he won.

  And so will we.
