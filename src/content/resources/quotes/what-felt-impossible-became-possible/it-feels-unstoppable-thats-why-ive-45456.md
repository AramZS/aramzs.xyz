  it feels unstoppable.

  That's why I've spent so much time lately learning about those that lived
  under the thumb of the KKK in the '20s. The speed with which the group grew,
  the influence it held, the mainstream embrace it received, and the fear it
  spread—I think about how impossible it must have felt to imagine that their
  influence would ever ebb.

  And I think about people like George Dale—there were many like him—who,
  despite it feeling impossible, and despite paying incredible personal cost,
  kept fighting anyway.

  And they won.
