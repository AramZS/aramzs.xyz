  More than that, it’s possible because that’s how we designed the world. We
  designed the combustion engine that led to global warming (climate change
  deniers can just stop reading right now). We designed the guns that kill
  school children. We designed shitty interfaces to protect our private
  information. We designed the religions that pitted us against one another. We
  designed social networks without any way of dealing with abuse or harassment.
  We designed a financial incentives system that would lead Mark Zuckerberg to
  assert what’s good for the world isn’t necessarily good for Facebook; and lead
  Jack Dorsey to believe engagement was a more important metric than safety.
  Either by action or inaction, through fault or ignorance, we have designed the
  world to behave exactly as it’s behaving right now. These are our chickens
  coming home to roost.
