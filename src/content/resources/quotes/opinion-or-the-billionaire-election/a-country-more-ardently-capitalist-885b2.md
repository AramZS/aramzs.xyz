  A country more ardently capitalist than most is asking itself, as seriously as
  at any time in the modern era, whether the ultrarich, just because they are
  ultrarich, endanger democracy. And a country just as committed, contrarily, to
  its founding ideal of equality is asking whether to resign itself to a gilded
  revolving door in which you unseat billionaire leaders you hate by electing
  billionaires you don’t mind.
