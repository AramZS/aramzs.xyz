  Interestingly, the massive increase in weight given to domain authority over
  the past two to three years appears to be an attempt by the search engines to
  overrule potentially poor internal link structures (as designing websites for
  PageRank flow doesn’t always serve users particularly well), and to reward
  sites that have great authority, trust, and high-quality inbound links.
