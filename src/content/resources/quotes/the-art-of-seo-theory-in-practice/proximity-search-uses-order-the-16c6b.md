  proximity search uses the order of the search phrase to find related
  documents. For example, when you search for “sweet German mustard” you are
  specifying only a precise proximity match. If the quotes are removed, the
  proximity of the search terms still matters to the search engine, but it will
  now show documents whose contents don’t exactly match the order of the search
  phrase, such as Sweet Mustard — German.
