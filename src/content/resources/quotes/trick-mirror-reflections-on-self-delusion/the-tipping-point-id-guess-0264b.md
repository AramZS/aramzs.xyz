  The tipping point, I’d guess, was around 2012. People were losing excitement
  about the internet, starting to articulate a set of new truisms. Facebook had
  become tedious, trivial, exhausting. Instagram seemed better, but would soon
  reveal its underlying function as a three-ring circus of happiness and
  popularity and success. Twitter, for all its discursive promise, was where
  everyone tweeted complaints at airlines and bitched about articles that had
  been commissioned to make people bitch. The dream of a better, truer self on
  the internet was slipping away.
