  I’ve been thinking about five intersecting problems: first, how the internet
  is built to distend our sense of identity; second, how it encourages us to
  overvalue our opinions; third, how it maximizes our sense of opposition;
  fourth, how it cheapens our understanding of solidarity; and, finally, how it
  destroys our sense of scale.
