  This period of the internet has been labeled Web 1.0—a name that works
  backward from the term Web 2.0, which was coined by the writer and
  user-experience designer Darcy DiNucci in an article called “Fragmented
  Future,” published in 1999. “The Web we know now,” she wrote, “which loads
  into a browser window in essentially static screenfuls, is only an embryo of
  the Web to come. The first glimmerings of Web 2.0 are beginning to appear….The
  Web will be understood not as screenfuls of texts and graphics but as a
  transport mechanism, the ether through which interactivity happens.”
