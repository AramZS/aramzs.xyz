  The internet, in promising a potentially unlimited audience, began to seem
  like the natural home of self-expression. In one blog post, Megnut’s
  boyfriend, the blogger Jason Kottke, asked himself why he didn’t just write
  his thoughts down in private. “Somehow, that seems strange to me though,” he
  wrote. “The Web is the place for you to express your thoughts and feelings and
  such. To put those things elsewhere seems absurd.”
