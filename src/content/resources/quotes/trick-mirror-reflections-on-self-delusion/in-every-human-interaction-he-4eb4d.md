  In every human interaction, he wrote in The Presentation of Self in Everyday
  Life, a person must put on a sort of performance, create an impression for an
  audience. The performance might be calculated, as with the man at a job
  interview who’s practiced every answer; it might be unconscious, as with the
  man who’s gone on so many interviews that he naturally performs as expected;
  it might be automatic, as with the man who creates the correct impression
  primarily because he is an upper-middle-class white man with an MBA.
