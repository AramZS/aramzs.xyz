  In the run-up to the 2016 election and increasingly so afterward, I started to
  feel that there was almost nothing I could do about ninety-five percent of the
  things I cared about other than form an opinion—and that the conditions that
  allowed me to live in mild everyday hysterics about an unlimited supply of
  terrible information were related to the conditions that were, at the same
  time, consolidating power, sucking wealth upward, far outside my grasp.
