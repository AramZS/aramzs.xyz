  These deranged takes, and their unnerving proximity to online monetization,
  are case studies in the way that our world—digitally mediated, utterly
  consumed by capitalism—makes communication about morality very easy but makes
  actual moral living very hard. You don’t end up using a news story about a
  dead toddler as a peg for white entitlement without a society in which the
  discourse of righteousness occupies far more public attention than the
  conditions that necessitate righteousness in the first place.
