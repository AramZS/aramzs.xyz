  The presentation of self in everyday internet still corresponds to Goffman’s
  playacting metaphor: there are stages, there is an audience. But the internet
  adds a host of other, nightmarish metaphorical structures: the mirror, the
  echo, the panopticon. As we move about the internet, our personal data is
  tracked, recorded, and resold by a series of corporations—a regime of
  involuntary technological surveillance, which subconsciously decreases our
  resistance to the practice of voluntary self-surveillance on social media.
