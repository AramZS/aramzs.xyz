  When it was finished, RJR Nabisco had the Taj Mahal of corporate hangars,
  dwarfing that of Coca-Cola’s next door. The cost hadn’t gone into the hangar
  itself, but into an adjacent three-story building of tinted glass, surrounded
  by $250,000 in landscaping, complete with a Japanese garden. Inside a visitor
  walked into a stunning three-story atrium. The floors were Italian marble, the
  walls and doors lined in inlaid mahogany. More than $600,000 in new furniture
