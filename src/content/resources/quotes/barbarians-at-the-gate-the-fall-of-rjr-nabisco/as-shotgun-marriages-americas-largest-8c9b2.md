  As the shotgun marriages of America’s largest companies spurred Wall Street’s
  growth through the 1980s, one Wall Street firm initiated more major takeovers
  and created more tactical innovations than any other. First Boston, founded in

  the fore of major investment banks thanks largely to the brains and chutzpah
  of Bruce Wasserstein and Joe Perella.
