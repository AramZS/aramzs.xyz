  By the mid-1980s competitors such as Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch were
  thrusting into LBOs and, in efforts to compete with Drexel’s junk-bond
  capabilities, had begun lending their own money in interim takeover financings
  known as “bridge loans.” These loans were typically refinanced, or bridged, by
  the later sale of junk bonds. The trend was collectively known as merchant
  banking, a highfalutin term that basically meant investment banks were putting
  their money where their mouths had been for years.
