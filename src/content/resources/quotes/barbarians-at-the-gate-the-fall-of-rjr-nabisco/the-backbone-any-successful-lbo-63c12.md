  The backbone of any successful LBO is a set of projections: profits, sales,
  and, most important, cash flow. Because they dictate the amount of debt a
  company can safely repay, projections are the key to formulating a bid. And
  the right bid means everything to an LBO: The higher the price, the higher the
  debt. Too much debt can crush the healthiest companies.
