  Everyone in the room knew about leveraged buyouts, often called LBOs. In an
  LBO, a small group of senior executives, usually working with a Wall Street
  partner, proposes to buy its company from public shareholders, using massive
  amounts of borrowed money. Critics of this procedure called it stealing the
  company from its owners and fretted that the growing mountain of corporate
  debt was hindering America’s ability to compete abroad.
