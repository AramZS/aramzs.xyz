  The final run of Shearson’s raider express began on Black Monday, October 19,
  1987. As the market crashed, scores of pending takeovers unraveled, and Cohen
  and Sheinberg panicked. For the first time they realized that the firm could
  actually lose the hundreds of millions of dollars it was lending.
