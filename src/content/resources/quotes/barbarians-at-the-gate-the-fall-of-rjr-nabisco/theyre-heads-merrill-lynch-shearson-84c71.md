  “They’re the heads of Merrill Lynch, Shearson Lehman, and all the other big
  brokerages. In walks a hooker. It’s Milken. The debutantes wouldn’t have
  anything to do with a woman who sells her body for a hundred dollars a night.
  But this hooker is different. She makes a million dollars a night. Pretty
  soon, what have you got? Eleven hookers.”
