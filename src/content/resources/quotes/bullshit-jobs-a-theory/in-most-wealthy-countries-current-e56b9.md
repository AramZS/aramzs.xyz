  In most wealthy countries, the current crop of people in their twenties
  represents the first generation in more than a century that can, on the whole,
  expect opportunities and living standards substantially worse than those
  enjoyed by their parents. Yet at the same time, they are lectured relentlessly
  from both left and right on their sense of entitlement for feeling they might
  deserve anything else.
