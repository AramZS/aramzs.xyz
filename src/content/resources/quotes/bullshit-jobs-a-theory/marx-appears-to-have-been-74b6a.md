  Marx appears to have been right when he argued that a “reserve army of the
  unemployed” has to exist in order for capitalism to work the way it’s supposed
  to.7 But it remains true that “More Jobs” is the one political slogan that
  both Left and Right can always agree on.8 They differ only about the most
  expedient means to produce the jobs.
