  It seemed to me the answer had to lie in the mind-set of the political class.
  Almost all of those making the key decisions had attended college in the
  1960s, when campuses were at the very epicenter of political ferment, and they
  felt strongly that such things must never happen again. As a result, while
  they might have been concerned with declining economic indicators, they were
  also quite delighted to note that the combination of globalization, gutting
  the power of unions, and creating an insecure and overworked workforce—along
  with aggressively paying lip service to sixties calls to hedonistic personal
  liberation (what came to be known as “lifestyle liberalism, fiscal
  conservativism”)—had the effect of simultaneously shifting more and more
  wealth and power to the wealthy and almost completely destroying the basis for
  organized challenges to their power.
