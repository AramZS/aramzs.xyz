  I work in development. This part of the television industry has expanded
  exponentially in the last twenty years. TV used to be commissioned by one
  channel controller who would ask producers he liked to make whatever shows
  they wanted. There was no “development.” There was just making the show. Now
  every company in TV (and film, too) has its own development team, staffed by
  three to ten people, and there are more and more commissioners whose job it is
  to listen to their pitches. None of these people make TV shows.
