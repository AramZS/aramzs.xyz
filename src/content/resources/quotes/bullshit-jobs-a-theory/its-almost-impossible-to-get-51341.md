  It’s almost impossible to get accurate figures about exactly what proportion
  of a typical family’s income in, say, America, or Denmark, or Japan, is
  extracted each month by the FIRE sector, but there is every reason to believe
  it is not only a very substantial chunk but also is now a distinctly greater
  chunk of total profits than those the corporate sector derives directly from
  making or selling goods and services in those same countries.
