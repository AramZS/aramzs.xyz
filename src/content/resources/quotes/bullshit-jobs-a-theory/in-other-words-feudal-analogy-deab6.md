  In other words, the feudal analogy is not even really an analogy.
  Managerialism has become the pretext for creating a new covert form of
  feudalism, where wealth and position are allocated not on economic but
  political grounds—or rather, where every day it’s more difficult to tell the
  difference between what can be considered “economic” and what is “political.”
