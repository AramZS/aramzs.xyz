  I heard about similar things going on in law firms involved with asbestos
  compensation payments as well. Whenever a very large sum of money, in the
  hundreds of millions, is set aside to compensate an entire class of people, a
  bureaucracy must be set up to locate claimants, process claims, and portion
  out the money. This bureaucracy may often involve hundreds or even thousands
  of people. Since the money that pays their salaries is ultimately coming from
  the same pot, they have no particular incentive to distribute the spoils
  efficiently.
