  Even in those prisons where inmates are provided free food and shelter and are
  not actually required to work, denying them the right to press shirts in the
  prison laundry, clean latrines in the prison gym, or package computers for
  Microsoft in the prison workshop is used as a form of punishment—and this is
  true even where the work doesn’t pay or where prisoners have access to other
  income.6 Here we are dealing with people who can be assumed to be among the
  least altruistic society has produced, yet they find sitting around all day
  watching television a far worse fate than even the harshest and least
  rewarding forms of labor.
