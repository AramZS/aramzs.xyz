  In a classic study of Delta Airlines flight attendants, The Managed Heart:
  Commercialization of Human Feeling, sociologist Arlie Russell Hochschild
  introduced the notion of “emotional labor.” Hoschschild found air hostesses
  typically had to spend so much effort creating and maintaining a perky,
  empathetic, good-natured persona as part of their conditions of employment
  that they often became haunted by feelings of emptiness, depression, or
  confusion, unsure of who or what they really were.
