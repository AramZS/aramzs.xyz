  The real problem here is with the concept of a “service economy” itself. There
  is a reason I just put the term in quotation marks. Describing a country’s
  economy as dominated by the service sector leaves one with the impression that
  people in that country are supporting themselves principally by serving each
  other iced lattes or pressing one another’s shorts. Obviously, this isn’t
  really true. So what else might they be doing?
