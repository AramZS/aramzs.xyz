  A hundred years ago, many assumed that the steady advance of technology and
  labor-saving devices would have made this possible by now, and the irony is
  that they were probably right. We could easily all be putting in a twenty- or
  even fifteen-hour workweek. Yet for some reason, we as a society have
  collectively decided it’s better to have millions of human beings spending
  years of their lives pretending to type into spreadsheets or preparing mind
  maps for PR meetings than freeing them to knit sweaters, play with their dogs,
  start a garage band, experiment with new recipes, or sit in cafés arguing
  about politics, and gossiping about their friends’ complex polyamorous love
  affairs.
