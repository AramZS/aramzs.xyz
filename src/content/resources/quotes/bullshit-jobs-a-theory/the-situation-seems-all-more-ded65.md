  The situation seems all the more extraordinary when we consider the larger
  social consequences of this proliferation. If it’s really true that as much of
  half the work we do could be eliminated without any significant effect on
  overall productivity, why not just redistribute the remaining work in such a
  way that everyone is working four-hour days? Or four-day weeks with four
  months’ yearly vacation time?
