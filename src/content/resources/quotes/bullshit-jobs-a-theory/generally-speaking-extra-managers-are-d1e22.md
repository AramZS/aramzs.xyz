  Generally speaking, extra managers are hired with the ostensible purpose of
  improving efficiency. But in this case, there was little to be improved; the
  workers themselves had boosted efficiency about as much as it was possible to
  do. But the managers were hired anyway. What this suggests is that what we are
  really dealing with here has nothing to do with efficiency but everything to
  do with changing understandings of the moral responsibilities of corporations.
