  In fact, experiments have also shown that if one first allows a child to
  discover and experience the delight in being able to cause a certain effect,
  and then suddenly denies it to them, the results are dramatic: first rage,
  refusal to engage, and then a kind of catatonic folding in on oneself and
  withdrawing from the world entirely. Psychiatrist and psychoanalyst Francis
  Broucek called this the “trauma of failed influence” and suspected that such
  traumatic experiences might lie behind many mental health issues later in
  life.
