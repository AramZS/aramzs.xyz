  in hierarchical environments typically ended up locked in a kind of
  pathological variation of the same sadomasochistic dynamic: the (person on
  the) bottom struggles desperately for approval that can never, by definition,
  be forthcoming; the (person on the) top going to greater and greater lengths
  to assert a dominance that both know is ultimately a lie—for if the top were
  really the all-powerful, confident, masterly being he pretends to be, he
  wouldn’t need to go to such outrageous lengths to ensure the bottom’s
  recognition of his power.
