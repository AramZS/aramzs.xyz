  The answer clearly isn’t economic: it’s moral and political. The ruling class
  has figured out that a happy and productive population with free time on their
  hands is a mortal danger. (Think of what started to happen when this even
  began to be approximated in the sixties.) And, on the other hand, the feeling
  that work is a moral value in itself, and that anyone not willing to submit
  themselves to some kind of intense work discipline for most of their waking
  hours deserves nothing, is extraordinarily convenient for them.
