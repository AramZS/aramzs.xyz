  One might be tempted to conclude from these responses that there is at least
  one class of people who genuinely don’t realize their jobs are bullshit.
  Except, of course, what CEOs do isn’t really bullshit. For better or for
  worse, their actions do make a difference in the world. They’re just blind to
  all the bullshit they create.
