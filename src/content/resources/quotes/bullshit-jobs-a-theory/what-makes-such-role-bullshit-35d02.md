  What makes such a role bullshit is when the plan obviously can’t work and any
  competent architect should have known it; when the system is so stupidly
  designed that it will fail in completely predictable ways, but rather than fix
  the problem, the organization prefers to hire full-time employees whose main
  or entire job is to deal with the damage.
