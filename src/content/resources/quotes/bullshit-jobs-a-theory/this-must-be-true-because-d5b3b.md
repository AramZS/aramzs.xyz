  This must be true because the market is freedom, and freedom is always good.
  Putting it this way might sound like a caricature, but I have met libertarians
  willing to say exactly that, in almost exactly those words.17 Of course, the
  problem with any such argument is that it’s circular; it can’t be disproved.
  Since all actually existing market systems are to some degree state regulated,
  it’s easy enough to insist that any results one likes (say, high levels of
  overall wealth) are the result of the workings of the market, and that any
  features one doesn’t like (say, high levels of overall poverty) are really due
  to government interference in the workings of the market—and then insist that
  the burden of proof is on anyone who would argue otherwise. No real evidence
  in favor of the position is required because it is basically a profession of
  faith.
