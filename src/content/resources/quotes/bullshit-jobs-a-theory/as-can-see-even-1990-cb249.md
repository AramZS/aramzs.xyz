  As we can see, even in 1990, the proportion of the workforce made up of actual
  waiters, barbers, salesclerks, and the like was really quite small. It also
  remained remarkably steady over time, holding for more than a century at
  roughly 20 percent. The vast majority of those others included in the service
  sector were really administrators, consultants, clerical and accounting staff,
  IT professionals, and the like.
