  The entire enterprise of making and selling banner ads, he was convinced, is
  basically a scam. The agencies that sell the ads are in possession of studies
  that made clear that Web surfers largely didn’t even notice and almost never
  clicked on them. This didn’t stop them, however, from basically cooking the
  books and holding junkets with their clients where they presented them with
  elaborate “proof” of the ads’ effectiveness.
