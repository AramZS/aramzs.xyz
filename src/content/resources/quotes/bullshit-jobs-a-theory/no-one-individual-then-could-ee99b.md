  No one individual, then, could be said to be sleeping on the streets simply
  because he or she was morally reprobate; but even if everyone sleeping on the
  streets really was morally reprobate in some way, it would be unlikely to do
  much to explain the rise and fall of levels of homelessness in different
  decades, or why rates of homelessness vary from country to country at any
  given time.
