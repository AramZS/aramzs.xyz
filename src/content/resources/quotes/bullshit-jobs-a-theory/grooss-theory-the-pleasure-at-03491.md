  Groos’s theory of “the pleasure at being the cause” led him to devise a theory
  of play as make-believe: humans invent games and diversions, he proposed, for
  the exact same reason the infant takes delight in his ability to move a
  pencil. We wish to exercise our powers as an end in themselves. The fact that
  the situation is made up doesn’t detract from this; in fact, it adds another
  level of contrivance.
