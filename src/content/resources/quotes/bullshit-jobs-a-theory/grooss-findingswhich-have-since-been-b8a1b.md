  Groos’s findings—which have since been confirmed by a century of experimental
  evidence—suggested maybe there was something much simpler behind what
  Nietzsche called the “will to power.” Children come to understand that they
  exist, that they are discrete entities separate from the world around them,
  largely by coming to understand that “they” are the thing which just caused
  something to happen—the proof of which is the fact that they can make it
  happen again.
