  It is managerialist ideologies put into practice in complex organizations. As
  managerialism embeds itself, you get entire cadres of academic staff whose job
  it is just to keep the managerialist plates spinning—strategies, performance
  targets, audits, reviews, appraisals, renewed strategies, etc., etc.—which
  happen in an almost wholly and entirely disconnected fashion from the real
  lifeblood of universities: teaching and education.
