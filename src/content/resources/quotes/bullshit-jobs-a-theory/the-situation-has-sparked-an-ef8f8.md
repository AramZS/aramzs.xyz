  the situation has sparked an efflorescence of social media (Facebook, YouTube,
  Instagram, Twitter): basically, of forms of electronic media that lend
  themselves to being produced and consumed while pretending to do something
  else. I am convinced this is the primary reason for the rise of social media,
  especially when one considers it in the light not just of the rise of bullshit
  jobs but also of the increasing bullshitization of real jobs.
