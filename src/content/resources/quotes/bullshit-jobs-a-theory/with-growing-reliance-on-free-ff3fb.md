  with the growing reliance on free software (freeware), paid employment is
  increasingly reduced to duct taping. Coders are often happy to perform the
  interesting and rewarding work on core technologies for free at night but,
  since that means they have less and less incentive to think about how such

  reduced during the day to the tedious (but paid) work of making them fit
  together.
