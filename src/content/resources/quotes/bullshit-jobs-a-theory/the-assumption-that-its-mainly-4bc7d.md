  the assumption that it’s mainly women who end up in bullshit jobs is not only
  sexist but also represents, to my mind, a profound ignorance of how most
  offices actually work. It’s far more likely that the (female) administrative
  assistant for a (male) vice dean or “Strategic Network Manager” is the only
  person doing any real work in that office, and that it’s her boss who might as
  well be lounging around in his office playing World of Warcraft, or very
  possibly, actually is.
