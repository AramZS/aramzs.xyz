  But for those who had been the objects of unrequited love, it was quite
  another matter. Many still struggled with guilt and confusion. One major
  reason, researchers concluded, was precisely the lack of cultural models.
  Anyone who falls in love with someone who does not return their affections has
  thousands of years’ worth of romantic literature to tell them exactly how they
  are supposed to feel; however, while this literature provides detailed insight
  on the experience of being Cyrano, it generally tells you very little about
  how you are supposed to feel—let alone what you’re supposed to do—if you’re
  Roxane.
