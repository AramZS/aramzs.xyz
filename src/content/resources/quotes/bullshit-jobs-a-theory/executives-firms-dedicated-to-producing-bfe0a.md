  Executives in firms dedicated to producing breakfast cereals, or agricultural
  machinery, saw themselves as having far more in common with production-line
  workers in their own firms than they did with speculators and investors, and
  the internal organization of firms reflected this. It was only in the 1970s
  that the financial sector and the executive classes—that is, the upper
  echelons of the various corporate bureaucracies—effectively fused. CEOs began
  paying themselves in stock options, moving back and forth between utterly
  unrelated companies, priding themselves on the number of employees they could
  lay off.
