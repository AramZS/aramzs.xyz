  While neoliberal rhetoric was always all about unleashing the magic of the
  marketplace and placing economic efficiency over all other values, the overall
  effect of free market policies has been that rates of economic growth have
  slowed pretty much everywhere except India and China; scientific and
  technological advance has stagnated; and in most wealthy countries, the
  younger generations can, for the first time in centuries, expect to lead less
  prosperous lives than their parents did. Yet on observing these effects,
  proponents of market ideology always reply with calls for even stronger doses
  of the same medicine, and politicians duly enact them.
