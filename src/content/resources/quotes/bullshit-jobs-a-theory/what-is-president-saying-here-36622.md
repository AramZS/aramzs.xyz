  What is the president saying here? He acknowledges that millions of jobs in
  medical insurance companies like Kaiser or Blue Cross are unnecessary. He even
  acknowledges that a socialized health system would be more efficient than the
  current market-based system, since it would reduce unnecessary paperwork and
  reduplication of effort by dozens of competing private firms. But he’s also
  saying it would be undesirable for that very reason.
