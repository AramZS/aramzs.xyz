  Where you might least expect it, products of every sort are remade by the new
  economic requirements of connection and rendition. Each is reimagined as a
  gateway to the new apparatus, praised for being “smart” while traditional
  alternatives are reviled for remaining “dumb.” It is important to acknowledge
  that in this context, “smart” is a euphemism for rendition: intelligence that
  is designed to render some tiny corner of lived experience as behavioral data.
