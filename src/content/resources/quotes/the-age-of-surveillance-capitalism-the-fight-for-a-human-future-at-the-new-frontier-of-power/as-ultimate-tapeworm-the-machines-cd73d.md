  As the ultimate tapeworm, the machine’s intelligence depends upon how much
  data it eats. In this important respect the new means of production differs
  fundamentally from the industrial model, in which there is a tension between
  quantity and quality. Machine intelligence is the synthesis of this tension,
  for it reaches its full potential for quality only as it approximates
  totality.
