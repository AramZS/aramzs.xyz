  It catalogues public contest as the unfortunate but predictable outcry of
  foolish populations who exhibit a knee-jerk “resistance to change,” wistfully
  clinging to an irretrievable past while denying an inevitable future: Google’s
  future, surveillance capitalism’s future. The theory indicates that opposition
  must simply be weathered as the signature of the first difficult phases of
  incursion. It assumes that opposition is fleeting, like the sharp yelp of pain
  when a Novocain needle first pierces the flesh, before numbness sets in.
