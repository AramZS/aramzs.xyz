  We may yet see the founding of a new synthesis for a third modernity in which
  a genuine inversion and its social compact are institutionalized as principles
  of a new rational digital capitalism aligned with a society of individuals and
  supported by democratic institutions. The fact that Schumpeter reckoned the
  time line for such institutionalization in decades or even centuries lingers
  as a critical commentary on our larger story.
