  The price you are offered does not derive from what you write about but how
  you write it. It is not what is in your sentences but in their length and
  complexity, not what you list but that you list, not the picture but the
  choice of filter and degree of saturation, not what you disclose but how you
  share or fail to, not where you make plans to see your friends but how you do
  so: a casual “later” or a precise time and place?
