  Surveillance capitalism’s products and services are not the objects of a value
  exchange. They do not establish constructive producer-consumer reciprocities.
  Instead, they are the “hooks” that lure users into their extractive operations
  in which our personal experiences are scraped and packaged as the means to
  others’ ends.
