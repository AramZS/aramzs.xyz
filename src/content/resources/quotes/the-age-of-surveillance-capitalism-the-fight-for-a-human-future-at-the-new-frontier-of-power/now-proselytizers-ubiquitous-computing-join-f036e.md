  Now the proselytizers of ubiquitous computing join Marx and other modern
  utopianists in postulating a new phase of history, like Paradiso’s
  “revolutionary phase shift,” in which all of society is reassembled in a novel
  and superior pattern. Despite the fact that inevitability is the opposite of
  politics and history, apostles of the apparatus routinely hijack historical
  metaphors that lend a veneer of gravitas to their claims.
