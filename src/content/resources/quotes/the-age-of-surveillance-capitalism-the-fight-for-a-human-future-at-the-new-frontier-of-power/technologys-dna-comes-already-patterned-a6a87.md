  technology’s DNA comes already patterned by what the sociologist Max Weber
  called the “economic orientation.” Economic ends, Weber observed, are always
  intrinsic to technology’s development and deployment. “Economic action”
  determines objectives, whereas technology provides “appropriate means.” In
  Weber’s framing, “The fact that what is called the technological development
  of modern times has been so largely oriented economically to profit-making is
  one of the fundamental facts of the history of technology.”
