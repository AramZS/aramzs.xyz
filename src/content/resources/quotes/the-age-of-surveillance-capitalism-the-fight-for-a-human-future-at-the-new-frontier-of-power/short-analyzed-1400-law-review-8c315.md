  Short analyzed 1,400 law review articles on the subject of regulation, all
  published between 1980 and 2005. As the influence of Hayek and Friedman
  predicts, the dominant theme of this literature was “the coercive nature of
  administrative government” and the systematic conflation of industry
  regulation with “tyranny” and “authoritarianism.”
