  primitive accumulation wasn’t just a one-time primal explosion that gave birth
  to capitalism. Rather, it is a recurring phase in a repeating cycle as more
  aspects of the social and natural world are subordinated to the market
  dynamic. Marx’s “original sin of simple robbery,” she wrote, “had eventually
  to be repeated lest the motor of capital accumulation suddenly die down.”
