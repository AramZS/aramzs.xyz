  Telematics produce continuous data flows, so real-time behavioral surplus can
  replace the traditional “proxy factors,” such as demographic information, that
  had previously been used to calculate risk. This means that surplus must be
  both plentiful (economies of scale) and varied (economies of scope) in both
  range and depth.
