  Economies of scope also proceed along a second dimension: depth. The drive for
  economies of scope in the depth dimension is even more audacious. The idea
  here is that highly predictive, and therefore highly lucrative, behavioral
  surplus would be plumbed from intimate patterns of the self. These supply
  operations are aimed at your personality, moods, and emotions, your lies and
  vulnerabilities. Every level of intimacy would have to be automatically
  captured and flattened
