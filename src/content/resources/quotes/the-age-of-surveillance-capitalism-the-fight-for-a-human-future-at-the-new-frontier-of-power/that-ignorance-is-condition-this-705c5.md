  that ignorance is a condition of this ubiquitous rendition; that decision
  rights vanish before one even knows that there is a decision to make; that
  there are consequences to this diminishment of rights that we can neither see
  nor foretell; that there is no exit, no voice, and no loyalty, only
  helplessness, resignation, and psychic numbing; and that encryption is the
  only positive action left to discuss when we sit around the dinner table and
  casually ponder how to hide from the forces that hide from us.
