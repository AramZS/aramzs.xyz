  The transformation that we witness in our time echoes these historical
  observations as the division of learning follows the same migratory path from
  the economic to the social domain once traveled by the division of labor. Now
  the division of learning “passes far beyond purely economic interests,” for it
  establishes the basis for our social order and its moral content.
