  These claims to lawless space are remarkably similar to those of the robber
  barons of an earlier century. Like the men at Google, the
  late-nineteenth-century titans claimed undefended territory for their own
  interests, declared the righteousness of their self-authorizing prerogatives,
  and defended their new capitalism from democracy at any cost.
