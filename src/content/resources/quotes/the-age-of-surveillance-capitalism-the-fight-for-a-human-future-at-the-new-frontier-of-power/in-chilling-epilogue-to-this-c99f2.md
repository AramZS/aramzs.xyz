  In a chilling epilogue to this chapter in the history of surveillance
  capitalism, on March 28, 2017, a newly elected Republican Congress voted in
  favor of a resolution to overturn the broadband privacy regulations over which
  the FCC had struggled just months earlier. The rules had required cable and
  phone companies to obtain meaningful consent before using personal information
  for ads and profiling. The companies understood, and they persuaded Republican
  senators, that the principle of consent would strike a serious blow to the
  foundational mechanisms of the new capitalism: the legitimacy of unilateral
  surplus dispossession, ownership rights to surplus, decision rights over
  surplus, and the right to lawless space for the prosecution of these
  activities.146 To this end the resolution also prevented the FCC from seeking
  to establish similar protections in the future.
