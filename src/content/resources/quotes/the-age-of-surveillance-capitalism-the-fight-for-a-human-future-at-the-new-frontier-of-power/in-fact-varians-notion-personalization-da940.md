  In fact, Varian’s notion of personalization is the precise opposite of the
  relationships with trusted professionals to which he refers. Doctors,
  accountants, and attorneys are held to account by mutual dependencies and
  reciprocities dictated by the extensive institutionalization of professional
  education, codes of conduct, and procedures for evaluation and review.
  Violation of these rules risks punishment in the form of professional sanction
  and public law. Google and its brethren in surveillance capitalism bear no
  such risks.
