  In the composition of the shadow text, rendition is Step One: the concrete
  operationalization of the “original sin of simple robbery” that defined this
  market project from the start. Google rendered the Earth, its streets, and its
  dwelling places, bypassing our consent and defying our protests. Facebook
  rendered the social network and its limitless details for the sake of the
  company’s behavioral futures markets. Now the ubiquitous apparatus is the
  means to the ubiquitous rendition of human experience. We have seen the
  urgency with which surveillance capitalists pursue the elimination of
  “friction” as a critical success factor in supply operations. The prediction
  imperative makes boundaries and borders intolerable, and surveillance
  capitalists will do almost anything to eliminate them. This pursuit transforms
  “connection” into a commercial imperative and transforms individual autonomy
  into a threat to surveillance revenues.
