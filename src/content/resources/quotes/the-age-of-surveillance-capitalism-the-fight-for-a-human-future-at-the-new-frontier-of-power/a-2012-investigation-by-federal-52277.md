  A 2012 investigation by the Federal Communications Commission described the
  case as “a deliberate software-design decision by one of the Google employees
  working on the Street View project.”44 The engineer had been selected for the
  team because of his unique expertise in Wi-Fi “wardriving,” the practice of
  driving around using equipment to locate wireless networks.45 His design notes
  indicated that user traffic and location data would be logged along with
  “information about what they are doing” that would “be analyzed offline for
  use in other initiatives.” The notes identified but then dismissed “privacy
  considerations.”46
