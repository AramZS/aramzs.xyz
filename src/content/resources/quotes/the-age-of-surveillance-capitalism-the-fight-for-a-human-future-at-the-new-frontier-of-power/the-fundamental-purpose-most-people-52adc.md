  The fundamental purpose of most people at Facebook working on data is to
  influence and alter people’s moods and behavior. They are doing it all the
  time to make you like stories more, to click on more ads, to spend more time
  on the site. This is just how a website works, everyone does this and everyone
  knows that everyone does this.
