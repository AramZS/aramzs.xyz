  Surveillance capitalism’s ability to corrupt and control these texts produces
  unprecedented asymmetries of knowledge and power that operate precisely as
  Durkheim had feared: the relatively free rein accorded to this market form and
  the innately illegible character of its action have enabled it to impose
  substantial control over the division of learning outside of our awareness and
  without means of combat.
