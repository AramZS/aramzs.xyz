  Nikola Tesla, who died without ever benefiting financially from his
  inventions. “You need to do more than just invent things,” Page reflected.61
  Brin had his own take: “Honestly, when we were still in the dot-com boom days,
  I felt like a schmuck. I had an internet startup—so did everybody else. It was
  unprofitable, like everybody else’s.”62 Exceptional threats to their financial
  and social status appear to have awakened a survival instinct in Page and Brin
  that required exceptional adaptive measures.
