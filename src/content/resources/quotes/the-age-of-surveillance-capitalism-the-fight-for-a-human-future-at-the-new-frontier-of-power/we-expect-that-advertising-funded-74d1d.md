  “We expect that advertising funded search engines will be inherently biased
  towards the advertisers and away from the needs of the consumers. This type of
  bias is very difficult to detect but could still have a significant effect on
  the market… we believe the issue of advertising causes enough mixed incentives
  that it is crucial to have a competitive search engine that is transparent and
  in the academic realm.”
