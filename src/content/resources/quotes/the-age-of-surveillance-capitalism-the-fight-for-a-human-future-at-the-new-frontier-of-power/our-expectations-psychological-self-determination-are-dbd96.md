  Our expectations of psychological self-determination are the grounds upon
  which our dreams unfold, so the losses we experience in the slow burn of
  rising inequality, exclusion, pervasive competition, and degrading
  stratification are not only economic. They slice us to the quick in dismay and
  bitterness because we know ourselves to be worthy of individual dignity and
  the right to a life on our own terms.
