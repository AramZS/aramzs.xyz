  This new market form is a unique logic of accumulation in which surveillance
  is a foundational mechanism in the transformation of investment into profit.
  Its rapid rise, institutional elaboration, and significant expansion
  challenged the tentative promise of the inversion and its advocacy-oriented
  values. More generally, the rise of surveillance capitalism betrayed the hopes
  and expectations of many “netizens” who cherished the emancipatory promise of
  the networked milieu.
