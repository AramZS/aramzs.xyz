  your intentions and motives, meanings and needs, preferences and desires,
  moods and emotions, personality and disposition, truth telling or deceit—is
  summoned into the light for others’ profit. The point is not to cure but to
  render all of it as immeasurably tiny bits of behavior available for
  calculation so that each can take its place on the assembly line that moves
  from raw materials to product development, manufacturing, and sales.
