  Demanding privacy from surveillance capitalists or lobbying for an end to
  commercial surveillance on the internet is like asking Henry Ford to make each
  Model T by hand or asking a giraffe to shorten its neck. Such demands are
  existential threats. They violate the basic mechanisms and laws of motion that
  produce this market leviathan’s concentrations of knowledge, power, and
  wealth.
