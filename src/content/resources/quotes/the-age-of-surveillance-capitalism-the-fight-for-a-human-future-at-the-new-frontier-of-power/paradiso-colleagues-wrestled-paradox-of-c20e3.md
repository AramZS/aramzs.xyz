  Paradiso and his colleagues wrestled with the paradox of, on the one hand,
  proliferating sensor data in nearly every environment—from smartphones to home
  devices to streets to cameras to cars—and, on the other hand, the difficulties
  involved in integrating sensor-generated data flows and producing meaningful
  analyses. Their answer was “DoppelLab,” a digital platform for combining and
  visually representing sensor data.15 The idea is to transform any physical
  space, from the interior of an office building to an entire city, into a
  “browse-able environment” where you can see and hear everything going on in
  that space as it flows from thousands or billions or trillions of sensors.
