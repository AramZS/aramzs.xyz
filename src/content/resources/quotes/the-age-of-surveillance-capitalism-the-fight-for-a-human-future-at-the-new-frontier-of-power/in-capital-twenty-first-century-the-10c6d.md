  In Capital in the Twenty-First Century, the French economist Thomas Piketty
  integrated years of income data to derive a general law of accumulation: the
  rate of return on capital tends to exceed the rate of economic growth. This
  tendency, summarized as r > g, is a dynamic that produces ever-more-extreme
  income divergence and with it a range of antidemocratic social consequences
  long predicted as harbingers of an eventual crisis of capitalism.
