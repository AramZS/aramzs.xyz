  Vizio, one of the world’s largest manufacturers and distributors of
  internet-enabled smart televisions. Vizio’s supply operations appear to be
  even more aggressive than Samsung’s. Investigators discovered that “on a
  second-by-second basis, Vizio collected a selection of pixels on the screen
  that it matched to a database of TV, movie, and commercial content.” The
  company then identified additional viewing data “from cable or broadband
  service providers, set-top boxes, streaming devices, DVD players, and
  over-the-air broadcasts.”
