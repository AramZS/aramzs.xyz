  “Herding” is a second approach that relies on controlling key elements in a
  person’s immediate context. The uncontract is an example of a herding
  technique. Shutting down a car’s engine irreversibly changes the driver’s
  immediate context, herding her out the car door. Herding enables remote
  orchestration of the human situation, foreclosing action alternatives and thus
  moving behavior along a path of heightened probability that approximates
  certainty.
