  Skinner prescribed a future based on behavioral control, rejecting the very
  idea of freedom (as well as every tenet of a liberal society) and cast the
  notion of human dignity as an accident of self-serving narcissism. Skinner
  imagined a pervasive “technology of behavior” that would one day enable the
  application of behavior-modification methods across entire human populations.
