  The most remarkable effect of the division of labor is not that it increases
  output of functions divided, but that it renders them solidary. Its role… is
  not simply to embellish or ameliorate existing societies, but to render
  societies possible which, without it, would not exist.… It passes far beyond
  purely economic interests, for it consists in the establishment of a social
  and moral order sui generis.18
