  auspices of the US Department of Commerce. After weeks of negotiations,
  consumer advocates walked out in protest over the hard-line position of the
  tech companies and their lobbyists on the single most pivotal issue: consent.
  The companies insisted on their right to use facial-recognition systems to
  identify a “stranger on the street” without first obtaining the individual’s
  consent. As one lobbyist in the talks told the press, “Everyone has the right
  to take photographs in public… if someone wants to apply facial recognition,
  should they really need to get consent in advance?” Privacy scholars were
  quick to respond that there is no lawfully established right to such actions,
  let alone a First Amendment right.
