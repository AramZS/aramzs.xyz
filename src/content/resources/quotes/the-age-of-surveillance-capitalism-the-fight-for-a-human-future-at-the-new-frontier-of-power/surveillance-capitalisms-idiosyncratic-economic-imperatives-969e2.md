  surveillance capitalism’s idiosyncratic economic imperatives defined by
  extraction and prediction, its unique approach to economies of scale and scope
  in raw-material supply, its necessary construction and elaboration of means of
  behavioral modification that incorporate its machine-intelligence–based “means
  of production” in a more complex system of action, and the ways in which the
  requirements of behavioral modification orient all operations toward
  totalities of information and control, creating the framework for an
  unprecedented instrumentarian power and its societal implications.
