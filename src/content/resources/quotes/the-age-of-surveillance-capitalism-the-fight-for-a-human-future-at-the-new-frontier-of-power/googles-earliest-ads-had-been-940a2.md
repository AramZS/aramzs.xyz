  Google’s earliest ads had been considered more effective than most online
  advertising at the time because they were linked to search queries and Google
  could track when users actually clicked on an ad, known as the “click-through”
  rate. Despite this, advertisers were billed in the conventional manner
  according to how many people viewed an ad.
