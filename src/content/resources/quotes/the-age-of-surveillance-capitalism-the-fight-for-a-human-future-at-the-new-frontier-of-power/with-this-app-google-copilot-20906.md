  With this app, Google the “copilot” prompts an individual to turn left and
  right on a path defined by its continuously accruing knowledge of the person
  and the context. Predictions about where and why a person might spend money
  are derived from Google’s exclusive access to behavior surplus and its equally
  exclusive analytic capabilities: “Eat here.” “Buy this.”
