  Among these he included the opportunity for “continuous experimentation.”
  Varian noted that Google has its engineering and data science teams
  consistently running thousands of “A/B” experiments that rely on randomization
  and controls to test user reactions to hundreds of variations in page
  characteristics from layout to buttons to fonts. Varian endorsed and
  celebrated this self-authorizing experimental role, warning that all the data
  in the world “can only measure correlation, not causality.”3 Data tell what
  happened but not why it happened. In the absence of causal knowledge, even the
  best predictions are only extrapolations from the past.
