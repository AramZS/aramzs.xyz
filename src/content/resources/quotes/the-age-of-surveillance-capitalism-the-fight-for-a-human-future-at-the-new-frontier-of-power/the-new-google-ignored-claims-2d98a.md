  The new Google ignored claims to self-determination and acknowledged no a
  priori limits on what it could find and take. It dismissed the moral and legal
  content of individual decision rights and recast the situation as one of
  technological opportunism and unilateral power. This new Google assures its
  actual customers that it will do whatever it takes to transform the natural
  obscurity of human desire into scientific fact.
