  In effect, what we’re doing is replicating the digital experience in physical
  space.… So ubiquitous connectivity; incredible computing power including
  artificial intelligence and machine learning; the ability to display data;
  sensing, including cameras and location data as well as other kinds of
  specialized sensors.… We fund it all… through a very novel advertising model.…
  We can actually then target ads to people in proximity, and then obviously
  over time track them through things like beacons and location services as well
  as their browsing activity.
