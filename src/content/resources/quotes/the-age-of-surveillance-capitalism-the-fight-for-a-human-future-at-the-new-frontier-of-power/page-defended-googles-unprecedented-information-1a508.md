  Page defended Google’s unprecedented information power with an extraordinary
  statement suggesting that people should trust Google more than democratic
  institutions: “In general, having the data present in companies like Google is
  better than having it in the government with no due process to get that data,
  because we obviously care about our reputation. I’m not sure the government
  cares about that as much.”94 Speaking to the company’s shareholders the day
  after the court’s ruling, Eric Schmidt characterized the decision as a
  “balance that was struck wrong” in the “collision between a right to be
  forgotten and a right to know.”95
