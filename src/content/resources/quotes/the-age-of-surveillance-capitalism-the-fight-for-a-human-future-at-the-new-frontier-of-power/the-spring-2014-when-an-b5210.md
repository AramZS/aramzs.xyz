  the spring of 2014, when an article in Advertising Age announced the company’s
  move into mobile advertising. Verizon’s VP of data marketing argued that such
  advertising had been limited by “addressability… the growing difficulty of
  tracking consumers as they move between devices.” As one marketing expert
  complained, “There isn’t a pervasive identity that tracks users from mobile
  applications and your mobile browser.” The article explained that Verizon had
  developed “a cookie alternative for a marketing space vexed by the absence of
  cookies.” Verizon aimed to solve advertisers’ tracking needs by assigning a
  hidden and undeletable tracking number, called a PrecisionID, to each Verizon
  user.
