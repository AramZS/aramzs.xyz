  Apple was criticized for extractive pricing policies, offshoring jobs,
  exploiting its retail staff, abrogating responsibility for factory conditions,
  colluding to depress wages via illicit noncompete agreements in employee

  stewardship—just to name a few of the violations that seemed to negate the
  implicit social contract of its own unique logic.
