  The uncontract is a feature of the larger complex that is the means of
  behavioral modification, and it is therefore an essential modality of
  surveillance capitalism. It contributes to economies of action by leveraging
  proprietary behavioral surplus to preempt and foreclose action alternatives,
  thus replacing the indeterminacy of social processes with the determinism of
  programmed machine processes.
