  Contract in this context of perfect rationality is what Williamson describes
  as “a world of planning.” Such planning was the basic institution of socialist
  economics, where the “new man” was idealized as possessing “a high level of
  cognitive competence” and therefore, it was espoused, could design highly
  effective plans.14 Varian deftly swaps out socialism’s “new man” and installs
  instead a market defined by surveillance capitalism’s economic imperatives,
  expressed through a ubiquitous computational architecture, the machine
  intelligence capabilities to which data are continuously supplied, the
  analytics that discern patterns, and the algorithms that convert them into
  rules.
