  The big pattern here is one of subordination and hierarchy, in which earlier
  reciprocities between the firm and its users are subordinated to the
  derivative project of our behavioral surplus captured for others’ aims. We are
  no longer the subjects of value realization. Nor are we, as some have
  insisted, the “product” of Google’s sales. Instead, we are the objects from
  which raw materials are extracted and expropriated for Google’s prediction
  factories.
