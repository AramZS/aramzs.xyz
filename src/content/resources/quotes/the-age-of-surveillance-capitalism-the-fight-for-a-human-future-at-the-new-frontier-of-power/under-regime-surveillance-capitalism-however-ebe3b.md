  Under the regime of surveillance capitalism, however, the first text does not
  stand alone; it trails a shadow close behind. The first text, full of promise,
  actually functions as the supply operation for the second text: the shadow
  text. Everything that we contribute to the first text, no matter how trivial
  or fleeting, becomes a target for surplus extraction. That surplus fills the
  pages of the second text. This one is hidden from our view: “read only” for
  surveillance capitalists.
