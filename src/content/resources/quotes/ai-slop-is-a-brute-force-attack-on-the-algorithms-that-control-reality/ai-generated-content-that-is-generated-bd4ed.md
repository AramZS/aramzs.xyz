  AI-generated content that is generated directly on Meta's own platforms will
  have content tags, metadata, and prompting data that will more easily allow
  the algorithm to deliver cute AI-generated golden retrievers to golden
  retriever owners alongside pet food ads that have golden retrievers in them
  for the golden retriever owners and rat terriers in them for rat terrier
  owners. It will deliver AI-generated doomsday, conspiracy, and natural
  disaster content to people who linger on AI-generated videos of wildfires and
  hurricanes, interspersed with AI-generated ads for preppers. Brave teens will
  get AI-generated creepypasta and jumpscare content. Religious people will get
  AI Jesus, the devil, and the Pope. Trump fans will get Elon Musk inspiration
  porn interspersed with AI-generated ads for Trump coins.
