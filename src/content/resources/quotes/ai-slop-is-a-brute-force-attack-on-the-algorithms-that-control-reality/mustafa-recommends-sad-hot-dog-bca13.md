  Mustafa recommends the "'sad hot dog' method to going viral," likening both
  social media algorithms and users to hungry people going to 7-Eleven at 2 a.m.
  looking for anything to eat: "when you're hungry at 2am, even a sad-looking
  hot dog tastes BETTER than any Michelin meal that only gives you 2 bites.
  Well, TikTok works pretty much the same way. Your audience isn't expecting (or
  even wanting) perfectly polished videos."
