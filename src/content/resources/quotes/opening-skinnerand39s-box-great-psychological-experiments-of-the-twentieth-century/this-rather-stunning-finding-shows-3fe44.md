  This rather stunning finding shows, perhaps most clearly of all, how rats,
  when in a “friendly” place, will actually avoid anything, heroin included,
  that interrupts their normal social behaviors. The rats liked the sweetened
  water, so long as they didn’t get stoned. At least in rodents, opiates are
  actually, in favorable situations, distinctly undesirable, which is a far cry
  from our understanding of them as inherently tempting.
