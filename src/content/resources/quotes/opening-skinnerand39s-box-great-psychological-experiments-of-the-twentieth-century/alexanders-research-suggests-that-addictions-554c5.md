  Alexander’s research suggests that addictions are in fact quite subject to
  free will. Rats and humans pick up the proverbial pipe and then put it back
  down, no problem. And when they don’t put it back down, it’s not because
  there’s something inherently irresistible about the substance, but because the
  particular set of circumstances the mammal finds itself in offers no better
  alternatives than such destructive snacking. Addiction in Alexander’s world is
  a life-style strategy, and like all human-constructed strategies, it’s
  malleable to education, diversion, opportunity. It’s a choice.
