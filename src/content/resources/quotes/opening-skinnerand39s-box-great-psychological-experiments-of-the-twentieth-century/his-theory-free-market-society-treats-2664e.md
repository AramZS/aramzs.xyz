  His theory: a free-market society treats its people as products, to be
  uprooted, moved, altered, according to economic need. “At the end of the 20th
  century, for rich and poor alike, jobs disappear on short notice, communities
  are weak and unstable, people routinely change families, occupation, technical
  skills, languages, nationalities, software and ideologies as their lives
  progress. Prices and incomes are no more stable than social life. Even the
  continued viability of crucial economic systems is in question. For rich and
  poor alike, dislocation plays havoc with the delicate interpenetrations of
  people, society, the physical world and spiritual values that are needed to
  sustain psychosocial integration.” In the absence of these things, says
  Alexander, we, like rats in cages, turn to substitutes, not because the
  substitutes are alluring in and of themselves, but because our circumstances
  are deficient, we without our gods.
