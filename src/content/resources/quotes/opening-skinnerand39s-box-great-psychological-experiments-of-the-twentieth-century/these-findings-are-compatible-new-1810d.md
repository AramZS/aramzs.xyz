  These findings are compatible with the new “coping” interpretation of human
  opiate addiction if one keeps in mind that rats are by nature extremely
  gregarious, active, curious animals. Solitary confinement causes extraordinary
  psychic distress in human beings and is likely to be just as stressful to
  other sociable species, and therefore to elicit extreme forms of coping
  behavior such as the use of powerful analgesics and tranquilizers, in this
  case morphine.
