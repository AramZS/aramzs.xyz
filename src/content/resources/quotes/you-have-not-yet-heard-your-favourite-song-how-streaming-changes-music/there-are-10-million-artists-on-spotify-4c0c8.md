Of the top 1000 artists on Spotify when I last checked, only 38 of them were even nominally indie, as best I could determine. Most of those deserved asterisks for either turning independent after already becoming famous (like Radiohead) or being on a major regional label (like Eslabon Armado on the California regional-Mexican label DEL Records or Official HIGE DANdism on the Japanese label Pony Canyon)."
