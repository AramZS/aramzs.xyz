  machine learning, or ML for short. It has powers and drawbacks that we will
  discuss later, but it also has a bad name. Machines don’t learn any more than
  they know, so when a human tells you a machine is learning, you can safely
  infer that nobody is learning. Sometimes ML works despite this, and sometimes
  it causes chaos.
