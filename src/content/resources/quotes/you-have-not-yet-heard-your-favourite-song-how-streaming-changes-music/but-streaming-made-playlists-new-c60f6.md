  But streaming made playlists the new medium of exchange for musical ideas.
  People started making playlists for each other, or even for strangers.
  Streaming services hired human playlist curators and human writers of
  algorithms for algorithmically curated playlists. A streaming playlist isn’t
  just an organizational alternative to albums, it’s a format you can (and can
  afford to) skim.
