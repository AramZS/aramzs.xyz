And because most people’s listening is around the average amount, what effectively ends up happening is that the most active streamers get to say what happens to the money from people who are paying for subscriptions but not really using them."

> Thus, in system terms, the people who stream less control a smaller share of the payments, and the people who stream more control a larger share. And because most people’s listening is around the average amount, what effectively ends up happening is that the most active streamers get to say what happens to the money from people who are paying for subscriptions but not really using them.
