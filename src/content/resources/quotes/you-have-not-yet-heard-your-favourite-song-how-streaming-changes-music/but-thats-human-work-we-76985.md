  But that’s human work. We can’t compute our way to tolerance and belonging and
  love and awe. We have to get there ourselves. But that doesn’t mean tools
  can’t help. We can start by understanding that our prejudices, our impulses
  and our tools are not an unholy alliance of synergistic hopelessnesses, but
  pieces of ourselves, connected by sinews and circuits.
