  The ‘you’ in this case is not the abstract you or the specific me, it’s the
  people who do or don’t comprise the community, and this is the key difference
  I finally understood. The right to stewardship of a virtual community is
  entirely internal. This is the scary thing kids understand instinctively that
  people my age struggle to apprehend, maybe: the transfer of the whole concept
  of identity into self-determination.
