  In business-model terms, both of these ideas are betting that the CD era,
  which for a while now has looked in retrospect like a period of music-buying
  abundance, was actually doing a pretty bad job of getting most people to spend
  money in proportion to their true and hidden love, and a better experience
  could get the same people, with their same love, to spend more.
