  One of my other personal favorite rap songs is the Turkish hip hop duet
  'Microphone Show', by Joker and Ayben, which despite the English title is
  mostly in Turkish. Joker is part of the generation (or two) of young Turkish
  and Turkish/German rappers who liberated Turkish hip hop from German in
  Germany, and Ayben, whose older brother Ceza was also part of this, helped a
  subsequent wave of female Turkish rappers start to liberate Turkish hip hop
  from Turkish male dominance.
