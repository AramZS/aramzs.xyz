  You’re not really being surveilled, but that’s not due to teleological
  humility or ethical judiciousness, it’s just that invasive surveillance
  doesn’t address any business problem that isn’t at once more easily and more
  effectively solved by regression to the mean. Automated serendipity is a hard
  bet, but it’s also a bad bet.
