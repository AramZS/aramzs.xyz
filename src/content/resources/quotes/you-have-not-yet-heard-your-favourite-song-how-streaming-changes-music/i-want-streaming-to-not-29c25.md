  I want streaming to not just help difficult music survive, to not just help in
  the ways it is already helping, but to become a new living argument against
  the idea that any of this is ‘difficult’: the music, or the process of finding
  it, or the journey of self-awareness that begins inside yourself, with the
  belief that other people are out there, and they’re interesting precisely
  because they aren’t you, and they’re singing songs and you can go hear them
  without even moving.
