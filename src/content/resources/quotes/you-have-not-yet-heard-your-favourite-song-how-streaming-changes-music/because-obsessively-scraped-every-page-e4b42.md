  because we obsessively scraped every page of the web that was conceivably
  about music, we knew more about those words than anybody else. We disassembled
  every page we scraped to figure out what bands or artists it was talking
  about, and what it was saying about them, and put this all in a giant
  database. We not only knew what were the most common words people used to
  describe any given band, but we knew how commonly each of those words were
  used for all bands, so we could tell how important each word was for each
  band.
