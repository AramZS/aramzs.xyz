  I need to hear how younger generations face their fate in the world we gave
  them, and we both need to find ways in which we can all compose a single
  living generation together. Deleting things is a new power, but not a new
  solution. We need conceptions of rebellion and resistance that are
  collectivist, not cacophonous or insular. We need music to tell us stories
  about how we overcome the fears that keep us from joy.
