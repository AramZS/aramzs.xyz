  The lowest common denominator might sound like an aesthetic condemnation, but
  it’s exactly the goal of factoring. Night Ranger’s ‘You Can Still Rock in
  America’ isn’t what I want to hear right now, but it definitely was once, and
  the nostalgia might be lazy and ineffective, but it’s not offensive. I smile,
  and hum a little of that chorus to myself as I go off, clicking ambiguously
  and cheerfully, in search of Sámi yoiks or n’dehou fusion or cat-calming music
  or whatever it is I alone know I want to hear next.
