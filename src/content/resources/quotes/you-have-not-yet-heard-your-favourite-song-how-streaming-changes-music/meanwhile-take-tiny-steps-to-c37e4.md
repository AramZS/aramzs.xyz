blockquote: "Meanwhile, we take tiny steps to reduce inequality or democratize access. The less misery there is, the less of it\_can collect. The remedy for missing voices isn’t arguing with them about whether they’ve been erased, it’s realizing that if you hear one voice saying that it feels like it has been erased, there are others. It’s wanting to hear all of them at once."

The remedy for missing voices isn’t arguing with them about whether they’ve been erased, it’s realizing that if you hear one voice saying that it feels like it has been erased, there are others.
