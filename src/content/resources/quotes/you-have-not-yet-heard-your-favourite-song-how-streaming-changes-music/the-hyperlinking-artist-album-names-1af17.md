  The hyperlinking of artist and album names in a streaming playlist is so basic
  that we hardly discuss it as a feature any more, but it makes it radically
  easier to promote whole albums via individual songs, which in the playlist era
  can be any of the album’s songs, rather than just the ones the label picked.
