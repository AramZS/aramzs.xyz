  dansband turned out to be hilarious and awesome. It’s the secret Swedish
  prehistory behind ABBA, a guilelessly sentimental anti-elitist folk pop in the
  folkiest and poppiest senses of those words. It still exists, 50 years on, and
  exuberantly absorbs new styles into its graciously populist glamor. My
  personal favorite dansband group, Blender, is a little like Roxette
  moonlighting as the house band at Chuck E. Cheese, or maybe more accurately
  the other way around.
