  attributing media’s socially damaging effects to direct malice is
  misunderstanding the essential nature of current media technology. People
  could have wrecked a cookie company by pursuing profits over chewiness, too,
  but it would have taken cynicism and time. ML can do it without malice,
  quickly.
