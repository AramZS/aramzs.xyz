  Chaotic markets do not ensure economic freedom. An audience is not a reliable
  employer. There are middle-class musicians, and middle-class ballet dancers,
  and middle-class basketball players, but they didn’t get there by
  institutional training and predictable career progression, like a store
  manager or a computer programmer. They got there by entering a stardom lottery
  and getting some of the numbers right, but not enough to win the jackpot.
