  We build social structures to amplify joy. This is the eudaemonic moral
  imperative: away from misery towards joy. If laws against fear operate
  paternalistically, through the communicative frameworks of authority, the
  structures of joy are usually less literal and more personal, arising from
  what we allow more than what we prevent.
