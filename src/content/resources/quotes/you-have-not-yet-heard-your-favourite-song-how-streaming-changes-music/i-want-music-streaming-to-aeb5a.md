  I want music streaming to be available everywhere. When I came up with ideas
  for better ways to listen, I wanted to give them to everybody. It’s the world
  who listens, and thus I feel like it should also be obvious that the
  collective insights from this listening belong to the world. If there’s a way
  to bring more joy to more people, I want it for all of us, not portioned out
  by corporations according to secret treaties for the benefit of their
  stockholders.
