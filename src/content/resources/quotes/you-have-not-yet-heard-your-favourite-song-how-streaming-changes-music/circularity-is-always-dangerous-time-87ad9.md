  circularity is always dangerous, and time spent is a particularly weird
  metric. Sometimes people spend more time doing activities because those
  activities are engaging and rewarding. But sometimes they keep doing them out
  of addiction, or inertia, or fear. Sometimes they persist for tangible but
  inconsequential rewards, or in pursuit of withheld gratification, or to
  justify the sunk cost of frustration, or in ignorance of their alternatives.
