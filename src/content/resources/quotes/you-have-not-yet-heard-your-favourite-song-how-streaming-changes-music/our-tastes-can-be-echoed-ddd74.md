  Our tastes can be echoed back to us, almost indefinitely. But I also don’t get
  recommendations for whatever the next taste-shifting equivalent would be for
  me, today, the way Terri Nunn’s murmur was for me as a teenage American boy.
  Amapiano? Norwegian Americana? I had to find those wormholes on my own. The
  moments when you step outside of your own assumptions about yourself, and
  become somebody slightly new, are too rare and too singular to optimize for.
  It’s far easier, and far more reliable, to just feed you more of the
  already-familiar.
