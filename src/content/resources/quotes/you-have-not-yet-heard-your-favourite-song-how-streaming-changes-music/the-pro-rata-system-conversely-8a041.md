  The pro rata system, conversely, can’t really claim to be economically
  progressive by its structural definition, nor uniform in its effects. It’s
  slightly progressive in practical effect, redistributing a small amount of the
  wealthy’s wealth to the generally less wealthy, but not uniformly. What is the
  moral value of an erratic and marginal generalized advantage?
