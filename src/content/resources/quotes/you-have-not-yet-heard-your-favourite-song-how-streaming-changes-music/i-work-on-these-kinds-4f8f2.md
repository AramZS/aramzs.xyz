blockquote: "I work on these kinds of algorithms, and by working on them I assume responsibility for\_their actions and effects. They affect the way listeners spend their lives, and the way musicians support theirs. I believe that algorithmic mediation is necessary if making all the world’s music nominally accessible is to have any practical significance for individual listeners, and that this in turn is a laudable goal worth incurring both responsibility and risk."
