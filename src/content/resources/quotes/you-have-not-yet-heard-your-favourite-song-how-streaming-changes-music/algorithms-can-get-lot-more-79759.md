  Algorithms can get a lot more complicated than that, but they never get any
  smarter. They do not seek out challenges, they do not think flexibly, they
  don’t persevere to understand, and they don’t construct or critique arguments.
  They basically permanently fail at all the foundational Habits of Mind from my
  kid’s elementary school. They are not minds. They are, at most, symbolic
  machines. And more often than not, these ‘machines’ are just math. ‘Just’ is a
  mean-spirited word to use for this, though. Math is very useful. Symbolic
  machines can do extremely helpful symbolic work, and songs and fascinations
  are made of symbols.
