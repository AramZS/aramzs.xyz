  fan armies are their new online metastasis. There aren’t that many artists
  with enough global fans to constitute an army, but there are enough of them
  that they can’t all already be at the top of the streaming charts all the
  time. The fandoms of the teen-pop groups Fifth Harmony and One Direction both
  took this personally at different times and mounted substantial-enough
  group-looping campaigns to show up as statistical anomalies in the streaming
  data, but this wasn’t really perfected until the arrival of the BTS A.R.M.Y.,
  the online wing of K-pop septet BTS’s fandom, who were not only organized (and
  global) enough to orchestrate a lot of looping of each new BTS single, but
  also analytical enough to monitor multiple sources of data to track their
  progress.
