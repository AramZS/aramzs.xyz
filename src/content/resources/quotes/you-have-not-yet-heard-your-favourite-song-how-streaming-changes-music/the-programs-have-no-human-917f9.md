The humans whose data went into the programs might have had more intentional and nuanced advice for you, if you’d been talking to them individually and directly, but you aren’t, because they’re in Finland or Uruguay or Dagestan. And yet, their music is everywhere. The computers don’t actually know whether you will love\_it or not. The people don’t, either. But you still might."
