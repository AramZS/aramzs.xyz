  The front page of everynoise.com is a sprawling, scrolling sea of names of
  genres or other genre-shaped distinctions; a stack of nearly-infinite
  not-quite maps printed on infinitely thin internet velum so that you can fit
  them all into a phone or laptop-thin container and take them with you; a
  portal full of stars.
