  Thus Release Radar starts with artists you’ve followed, or have been listening
  to a lot, figuring that those are both solid hints that you might want to know
  if one of those artists has a new record. But if those two sets don’t provide
  enough new releases to fill the playlist, the system uses
  Discover-Weekly-style vector-embedding distances to find some more.
