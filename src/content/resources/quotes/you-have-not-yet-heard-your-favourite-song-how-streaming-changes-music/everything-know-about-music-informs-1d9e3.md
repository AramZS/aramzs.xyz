blockquote: "Everything we know about music informs it, every stream participates in its math. Exploration is not a degree of navigational complexity, it is a mode of observation. To explore is to try to experience things as they are. There are too many songs for you to hear them all, even if it made any sense to\_hear them at once. You can take this as a delightful challenge, or you can let it free you. You can plunge into the infinite, or you can float weightlessly on the surface of it. It remains infinite either way, the noises unending, more than you could ever hear but each one knowing that it could change you, that maybe you have not yet heard your favorite song."

To explore is to try to experience things as they are. There are too many songs for you to hear them all, even if it made any sense toÂ hear them at once. You can take this as a delightful challenge, or you can let it free you. You can plunge into the infinite, or you can float weightlessly on the surface of it. It remains infinite either way, the noises unending, more than you could ever hear but each one knowing that it could change you, that maybe you have not yet heard your favorite song.
