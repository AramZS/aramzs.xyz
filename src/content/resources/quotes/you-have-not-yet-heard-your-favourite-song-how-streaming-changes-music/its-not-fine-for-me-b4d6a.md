> it’s not fine for me. I want to hear everything. I want to hear things that make me uncomfortable at first, and maybe also at last. I want to hear things that are not extrapolations from what I’ve heard already. I do not want to hold still. I do not want to be delighted at. I do not consider 'effortless' to be an enticement. I don’t want solicitous robots bringing me monogrammed caramels. I want to try things that look weird and taste weirder. I’m willing to do work. I don’t want tools that assume what work I would have done, I want power tools that magnify the work I’m doing.
