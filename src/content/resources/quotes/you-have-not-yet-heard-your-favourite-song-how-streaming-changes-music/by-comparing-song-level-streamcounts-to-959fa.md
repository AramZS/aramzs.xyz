  By comparing song-level streamcounts to the ones in the Spotify charts they
  were able to see that, for example, the Spotify internal charts up until 2021
  intentionally reduced the effects of looping by counting a capped number of
  plays per day per song per listener. This wasn’t exactly secret, and even the
  actual cap-value of 10 was pretty-generally known, but it wasn’t prominently
  disclaimed, and it resulted in the heavily-looped BTS single 'Butter' losing
  out to Olivia Rodrigo’s 'good 4 you' on Spotify’s own charts during its
  release week, despite setting historic records for its total streams.
