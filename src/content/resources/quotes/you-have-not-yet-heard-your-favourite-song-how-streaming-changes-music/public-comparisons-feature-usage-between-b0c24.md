  public comparisons of feature usage between services have suggested that
  listener-created playlists represent over half of Spotify playlist streams
  (and 10-30% on the other major services), and if you search for any popular
  playlist topic you can usually find a few listener-curated playlists with
  hundreds of thousands of followers. That’s a lot of unmanaged cultural
  attention, set structurally free by the new powers despite, or perhaps as the
  price of, their centralized technical control.
