> I mean this collectively even more than I mean it individually. A song, once sung, is a gift to the world. It can be given withÂ strings of profitability attached, but morally speaking, I believe its existence becomes a matter of public good, and it should be recoverable from the air it once moved. We should never lose the ability to hear it again.
