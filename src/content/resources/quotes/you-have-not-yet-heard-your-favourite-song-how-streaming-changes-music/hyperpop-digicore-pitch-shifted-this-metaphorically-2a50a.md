  Hyperpop and digicore pitch-shifted this (metaphorically and/or literally)
  back up into a kind of processed half-voyeuristic evasiveness, cresting in
  fast-arriving miniwaves like AG Cook and SOPHIE’s PC Music, 100 gecs’s
  glittery electro-collage pop and glaive’s token emergence from early-pandemic
  Soundcloud/Discord scenes, all emphasizing how far some kids with computers
  can get, rhythmically and sonically, from punk’s sneakily neo-traditional
  minimalism despite starting with what we might be willing to think of as
  roughly the same feelings of socially-resistant exhibitionism.
