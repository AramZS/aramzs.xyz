  The idea that Laws of Robotics should be addressed to robots is
  tin-heart-warming. Asimov was a science-fiction writer, and wasn’t technically
  'proposing' those laws as much as speculating a future in which they would
  exist. The story that introduced them was written in 1942, and quoted them
  from a diegetic Handbook of Robotics published in 2058 in its '56th edition'.
  If those editions were annual, we would have had this book by now.
