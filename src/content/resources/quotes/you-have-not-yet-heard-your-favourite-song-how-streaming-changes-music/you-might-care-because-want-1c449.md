  You might care because you want more music, too. Or you might care because you
  know the world is big, but you feel stuck in the small parts you already know.
  Or maybe you’re a musician, and you care because these questions and their
  answers kind of determine how and whether you’re going to be able to make a
  living this way. Or maybe you work on technology, or it works on you, and some
  of these stories and lessons about applying algorithms to music-tastes are
  also stories about how computers and people coexist in general. Or maybe you
  agree with me that music is part of how we make a world of suspicious insular
  factions into a global community.
