  The occasional mail-order singles club flung itself melodramatically against
  this establishment over the course of the Album Era, perhaps most grandly in
  the form of the twee UK label Sarah Records, which set out to release 100
  numbered singles and then disband, and did that from 1987-1995, albeit along
  the way also putting out several compilations of the same songs and two
  shorter sequences of 10-inch and 12-inch LPs.
