  for people who listen to less popular music, or combinations of music that
  don’t always share an audience, the same fuzziness that works to find
  pleasantly unfamiliar indie-pop for indie-pop fans may instead take a fan of
  gothic symphonic metal and Uruguayan techno and give them Russian folk-dance
  music. Russian folk-dance music is awesome, and anybody who has already
  embraced gothic symphonic metal and Uruguayan techno should definitely give it
  a chance. It turns out that I particularly like lezginka, a clattery Caucasian
  6/8 sword-dance music, maybe even more than I like Uruguayan techno, although
  not as much as I like Nightwish or Flight of Icarus. One truly great thing
  about using computers for music recommendation, as opposed to for self-driving
  cars or actuarial forecasting, is that the thing at the end is always music,
  not turtles getting run over or refused life-insurance.
