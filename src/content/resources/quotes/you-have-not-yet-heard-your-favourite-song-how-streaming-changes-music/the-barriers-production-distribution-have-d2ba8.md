  The barriers of production and distribution have been lowered enough that
  indie success is now rare, but possible. I don’t know how many of the top 1000
  CDs in 1999 were independent releases, but I bet it was lot fewer than 25%,
  and probably fewer than 38. The new numbers for independent music are
  astonishing even if we don’t know what the old ones were.
