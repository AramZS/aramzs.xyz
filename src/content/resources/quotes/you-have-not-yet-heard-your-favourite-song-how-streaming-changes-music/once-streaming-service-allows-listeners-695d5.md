  once a streaming service allows listeners to make playlists themselves, and
  learns how to use algorithms to generate personalized playlists for them, then
  there’s effectively no constraint of scale. In the same way that streaming
  allows 10 million artists online, it allows 100 million fans to become
  curators of essentially the same format as RapCaviar, and 500 million fans to
  be audiences of the new minimum size of one.
