  But aspiring curators can dream, like aspiring rappers. The old world had no
  magic that could turn a record player into a radio station, but the moment
  your personal obsessively-assembled playlist of uplifting sung-chorus grime
  anthems, or ondes Martenot chamber music, clicks from one listener to two, it
  becomes obvious that that number could become anything at any moment.
