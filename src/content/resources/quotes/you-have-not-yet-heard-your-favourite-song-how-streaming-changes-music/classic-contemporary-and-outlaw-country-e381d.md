  Classic and Contemporary and Outlaw Country each also form distinct clusters.
  There is a Canadian country scene, and an Australian one, and even a Czech
  one, and American country gets you to Gothic Americana and Black Americana and
  Norwegian Americana, and Sertanejo is basically the Brazilian version of
  country music. Instead of granting implicit ownership of ‘Country Music’ to
  any one of these by virtue of popularity, it’s at least a start to try to
  understand this diversity for its own sake, and present it for the listener’s.
  ‘Recommendation’ is not just the wrong word, it’s the wrong idea. We don’t
  undo historical underrepresentation by picking different favorites, we undo it
  by disassembling the norms that pick favorites in the first place.
