  It would thus be insanely naive to imagine that capitalist structures like
  labels and streaming companies (especially public ones), which hoard power by
  their inherent nature, will automatically align with the collective human
  interest in the future of music by pursuing their individual commercial
  interests. That has generally not worked for anything. But self-interest can
  be marshaled into collective interest through laws. The music business
  probably needs more laws. And as a global structure, the music business
  probably needs world laws, and thus governments who are good at laws have an
  opportunity to lead by example. Laws operate by offering us excuses to act
  morally, in spirit as much as obedience, and thus we also need mores.
