  It tends to be singer-songwriterly, but some of it isn’t. It often sounds like
  its singers are musical fans, or at least think of modern musicals as a normal
  part of pop music. It’s alternative in the sense of not existing as function
  of the mainstream adult/commercial music apparatus. One of its pervasive
  lyrical themes is the idea of thinking of yourself as a character: as a
  villain or hero, as a protagonist or not a main character, as someone whose
  story will be told, as someone who thinks about their decisions as if their
  story might one day be told. It’s native to social media, because of course it
  is, but not allegiant to any specific brand. Its artists’ self-written Spotify
  bios usually go something like ‘hi. idk. maybe tomorrow I will delete this.’
  And maybe they will, but until then we are allowed to witness the scene that
  has formed around their ambivalence. Melanie Martinez’s Pity Party is its
  immediate precursor, and Olivia Rodrigo’s Sour is its pop crossover, but
  MOTHICA’s plaintively harrowing ‘forever fifteen’ is its definition, to me:
  fighting depression as if not at all sure of victory, but victorious by
  definition of the song’s narrative perspective; made out of small musical
  parts but vast emotional depth; kid and not-kid selves looking at each other
  across a table strewn with pieces of a life.
