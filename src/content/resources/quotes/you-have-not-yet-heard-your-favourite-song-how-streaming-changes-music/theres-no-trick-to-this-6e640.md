  There’s no trick to this, or there is but it’s the same obvious trick by which
  you overcome any fear that separates you from other people: you go instead of
  staying safely home. You conquer your fear by first realizing that fear isn’t
  an enemy to be conquered, it’s a reverse-mirage that makes it look like the
  place you are is the only inhabitable one.
