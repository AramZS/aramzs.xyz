  Recapitulating the way in which 80s hard rock embraced Yamaha DX7s, then,
  another revivalist wave emerged to re-follow that lineage, with The Midnight
  bridging the way from synthwave into what I call nightrun (after a 1985 UFO
  song called ‘Night Run’ that seems to me like the ur-text for this), and the
  Swedish group-of-convenience Gathering of Kings linking onwards from nightrun
  into the Swede-heavy revival of glam metal as (self-named) sleaze rock.
