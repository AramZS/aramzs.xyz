  On the whole, if more-active listeners listen to more-popular artists, then
  the pro rata scheme will be regressive in the economic (and social) sense,
  compared to the user-centric one, taxing the less-popular artists to
  consolidate wealth in the most-popular. Whereas if more-active listeners tend
  to listen to less-popular artists, then the pro rata scheme will be
  progressive, redistributing money from more-popular artists to less-popular
  ones. Thus this very basic question can be answered quantitatively by
  computing the average number of monthly streams per Spotify listener, and then
  calculating the average monthly total plays per artist of the artists played
  by listeners with fewer streams than that vs the ones with more. A ratio
  greater than 1.0 shows that pro rata is regressive, a ratio less than 1.0
  shows that it’s progressive, and either way it does so without revealing any
  remotely-proprietary actual counts or averages. When I monitored it at
  Spotify, it hovered around 0.83. More-active-than-average listeners play
  artists who are, on average, 0.83x as popular as the artists played by
  less-active-than-average listeners. The averages vary considerably across
  countries, and a little bit over time, and thus the ratio varies minorly in
  both dimensions as well, but not in magnitude or direction. Pro rata is
  progressive, and user-centric would be regressive.
