  The crash actually cut the industry to about a third of its size, not just a
  half, and 2021 is effectively level with 1991 and 2006, not the 1999 peak. Or
  1977-1979, for that matter. So if it feels to you like things in the music
  business are a lot worse than they were, that’s because they mostly are.
