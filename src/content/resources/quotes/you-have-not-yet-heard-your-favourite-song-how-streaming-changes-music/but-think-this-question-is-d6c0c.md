  But I think this question is not actually about geometry, it’s about love and
  time. It’s not idle actuarial curiosity. What we want to know is if we can be
  musicians, just because we want to, instead of getting some other job. If art
  is important, isn’t making art an important occupation? The social promise of
  the middle class isn’t just that it exists, it’s that you can reach it by
  earnest, unheroic effort. But if you want that, you want socialism. Not a
  partial simulation of socialism staged inside of the cash-flows of
  subscription music streaming. You want a Universal Basic Income so that
  everyone can choose how to spend their time, whether that’s writing songs or
  teaching middle-school history or growing raspberries. Neo-liberal capitalism
  doesn’t provide that. It doesn’t give music the economic support it humanely
  deserves, but that’s because it doesn’t make humane decisions. It makes market
  decisions, and those are not driven by social goals or moral truths, they’re
  driven by the unplanned and unforeseen interactions of micromotives and
  macrobehavior. A truly new economy could work any way we imagine. But we don’t
  have one yet. Streaming isn’t a new economy, it’s just a new market.
