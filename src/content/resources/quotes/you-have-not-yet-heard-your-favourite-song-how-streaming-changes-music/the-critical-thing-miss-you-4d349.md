  The critical thing you miss, if you go looking for punk that acts like the
  punk you know, is that the first punk wave tried to take over the culture
  rather than suffer it, but this wave realizes that it can just have its own
  culture to itself. ‘I’m gonna go over the Berlin Wall’, Johnny Rotten snarled,
  but the Wall has been down since before today’s kids were born. There’s a
  piece of it outside of a random business-school here in Cambridge where I
  live. The scary thing about the new music is that it doesn’t care if you know.
  It’s not trying to scare you, because it doesn’t care what you think, and it
  has given up on wondering what you’re going to do.
