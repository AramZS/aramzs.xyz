blockquote: "(Although, in this case it actually didn’t have a name of its own yet, it was basically just ‘the obscure gothic symphonic metal that only really devoted gothic symphonic metal fans would like’. Part of what genre-modeling allows us to do is find these communities that demonstrably exist but don’t yet have names for themselves, and lend them one to use until they think of their own. I made up ‘fallen angel’ for this one, because it was more descriptively\_evocative (and shorter) than ‘deep gothic symphonic metal’, and so far I haven’t had any complaints."
