  At Spotify we also had the ability to override release dates and release types
  (single/EP/album/compilation…), but that’s pretty much it. Any other kinds of
  errors, from audio glitches and song-order mistakes, all the way down to
  missing spaces after commas in song-titles, were neither our responsibility
  nor our right to fix.
