This was perfected as gothic symphonic metal by Nightwish, later popularized by the American band Evanescence, and still later exploded into the berzerk Japanese variation kawaii (Japanese for ‘cute’) metal in which teams of young female stardom-groomed J-pop idols are assigned metal backing bands instead of pop ones, an idea that still seemed novel when the early stars BABYMETAL were named, but quickly became just another vast subgenre."
