  The intro-level thing you learn by experiencing other cultures is that other
  people are neither the same as you nor frighteningly different. The
  advanced-level thing you learn is that 'other' is not a category, and the
  other people are not all united against you by their otherness, or at least no
  more than we are all united by our voices, whatever languages come out of our
  throats. Once you get curious about hearing what people have to say, you
  unlock all the languages at once.
