  Share your music. Send your friends songs they might like. Gush at strangers,
  post about discoveries, wear the band shirts you bought, find a couple songs
  in your vocal range so you aren’t terrified of karaoke. Take a vacation to
  someplace where they make music you like and eat their food. We can form
  ourselves into chords, but only if we sing out loud.
