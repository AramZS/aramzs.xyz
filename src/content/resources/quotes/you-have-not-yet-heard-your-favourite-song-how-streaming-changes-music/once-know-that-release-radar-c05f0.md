  Once you know that Release Radar is built this way, you can usually spot where
  the sections stop and start. First there are new songs by any artists you
  already follow. Then there are new songs by artists you don’t follow, but have
  played, in order by how much you’ve played them. When you stop recognizing the
  artists, you’re probably into the third section of extra guesses, and you
  should feel free to scan the rest of the list for any other familiar names.
