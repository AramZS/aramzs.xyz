  almost all the data and credits for streaming music comes from the licensors
  and isn’t up to streaming services to determine, validate or correct. Every
  streaming service has to do the work of turning artist credits in XML files
  into some number of split or combined artist pages, exactly because no one
  licensor necessarily controls the whole worldwide rights to any one artist’s
  music.
