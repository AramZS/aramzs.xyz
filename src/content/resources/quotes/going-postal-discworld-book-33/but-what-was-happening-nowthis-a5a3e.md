  But what was happening now…this was magical. Ordinary men had dreamed it up
  and put it together, building towers on rafts in swamps and across the frozen
  spines of mountains. They’d cursed and, worse, used logarithms. They’d waded
  through rivers and dabbled in trigonometry. They hadn’t dreamed, in the way
  people usually used the word, but they’d imagined a different world, and bent
  metal around it. And out of all the sweat and swearing and mathematics had
  come this…thing, dropping words across the world as softly as starlight.
