  AI is an ideological project to shift authority and autonomy away from
  individuals, towards centralized structures of power. Projects that claim to
  “democratize” AI routinely conflate “democratization” with “commodification”.
  Even open-source AI projects often borrow from libertarian ideologies to help
  manufacture little fiefdoms.
