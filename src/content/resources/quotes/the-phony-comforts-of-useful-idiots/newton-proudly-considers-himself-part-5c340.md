  Newton proudly considers himself part of the "real and dangerous" crowd, but
  as Marcus points out only vaguely gestures at dangers while ignoring those
  that already exist: "Covert racism? Deepfakes? Propaganda? Discrimination in
  employment, insurance, and housing?" Marcus also points out the dichotomy
  comes with a glaring analytical blindspot: "thinking that if an AI is stupid
  (or overrated) it can't be dangerous." Newton charges the “fake and sucks”
  camp with a blindspot that overlooks danger but Newton’s is arguably more
  dangerous: his immaterial analysis would likely overlook AI-powered deepfakes,
  propaganda, fossil fuel extraction, insurance tech, and assassination drones,
  if it meant that chatbots were being used by hundreds of millions of people.
