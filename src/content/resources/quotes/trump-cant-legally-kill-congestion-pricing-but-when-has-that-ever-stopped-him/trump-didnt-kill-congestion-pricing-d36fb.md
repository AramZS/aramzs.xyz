  Trump didn't kill congestion pricing in his first day blizzard of executive
  orders, and he hasn't done so since. It's probably not because he feels
  restrained by the courts. More likely, he enjoys having two neutered leaders
  in New York, or even more likely, he thinks it's better for Rep. Mike Lawler
  to have a shillelagh with which to club Hochul when he runs for governor next
  year because both men think the toll will be politically toxic enough to make
  for a winning campaign issue.
