  A credit default swap was confusing mainly because it wasn’t really a swap at
  all. It was an insurance policy, typically on a corporate bond, with
  semiannual premium payments and a fixed term. For instance, you might pay
  $200,000 a year to buy a ten-year credit default swap on $100 million in
  General Electric bonds. The most you could lose was $2 million: $200,000 a
  year for ten years. The most you could make was $100 million, if General
  Electric defaulted on its debt any time in the next ten years and bondholders
  recovered nothing.
