  the synthetic subprime mortgage bond–backed CDO, or collateralized debt
  obligation. Like the credit default swap, the CDO had been invented to
  redistribute the risk of corporate and government bond defaults and was now
  being rejiggered to disguise the risk of subprime mortgage loans. Its logic
  was exactly that of the original mortgage bonds. In a mortgage bond, you
  gathered thousands of loans and, assuming that it was extremely unlikely that
  they would all go bad together, created a tower of bonds, in which both risk
  and return diminished as you rose. In a CDO you gathered one hundred different
  mortgage bonds—usually, the riskiest, lower floors of the original tower—and
  used them to erect an entirely new tower of bonds.
