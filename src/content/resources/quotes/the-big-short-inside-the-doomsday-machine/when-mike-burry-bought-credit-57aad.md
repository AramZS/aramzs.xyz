  When Mike Burry bought a credit default swap based on a Long Beach Savings
  subprime–backed bond, he enabled Goldman Sachs to create another bond
  identical to the original in every respect but one: There were no actual home
  loans or home buyers. Only the gains and losses from the side bet on the bonds
  were real.
