  In Eisman’s view, the unwillingness of the U.S. government to allow the
  bankers to fail was less a solution than a symptom of a still deeply
  dysfunctional financial system. The problem wasn’t that the banks were, in and
  of themselves, critical to the success of the U.S. economy. The problem, he
  felt certain, was that some gargantuan, unknown dollar amount of credit
  default swaps had been bought and sold on every one of them.
