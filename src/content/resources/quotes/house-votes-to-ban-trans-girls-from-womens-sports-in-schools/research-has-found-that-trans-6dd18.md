  Research has found that trans women who undergo testosterone suppression
  through gender-affirming care have no clear biological advantages over cis
  women in elite sports. Trans athletes have also pointed out that athletic
  ability among trans people varies just as it does for cisgender people. The
  NCAA, the largest college sports governing body in the country, calls for each
  sport’s national governing body to set rules for transgender student-athletes.
