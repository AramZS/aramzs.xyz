  Jon Harris Maurer, Public Policy Director of Equality Florida, emphasized that
  the bathroom bans are just the latest attempt by the state’s GOP to eradicate
  trans people from public life. “These are hard working, tax paying individuals
  who are our family, neighbors, and colleagues,” he told Erin in the Morning.
  “Weaponizing bathroom access in a place like the State Capitol is an
  antidemocratic effort to block them from directly participating in government
  while simultaneously stripping their rights behind closed doors.”
