  In his dreadful lassitude and objectless rage, Cobain seemed to give wearied
  voice to the despondency of the generation that had come after history, whose
  every move was anticipated, tracked, bought and sold before it had even
  happened. Cobain knew that he was just another piece of spectacle, that
  nothing runs better on MTV than a protest against MTV; knew that his every
  move was a cliché scripted in advance, knew that even realizing it is a cliché
