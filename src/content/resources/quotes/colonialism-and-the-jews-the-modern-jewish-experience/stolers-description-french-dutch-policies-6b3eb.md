  Stoler’s description of French and Dutch policies and attitudes toward their
  colonial subjects can be easily mapped onto attitudes and policies toward Jews
  in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Europe. Emancipation was granted on a
  quid pro quo basis. Cultural and economic regeneration—that is, mastery of the
  host society’s language, the adoption of reigning cultural mores, and a
  movement from the traditional practice of peddling to livelihoods in crafts
  and agriculture—were considered either preconditions for citizenship (as in
  the German states) or immediate and necessary outcomes of the attainment of
  citizenship (as in France). For Jews in post-Napoleonic Prussian Poland, as
  for Indo-Europeans in colonial southeast Asia, citizenship was granted on a
  case-by-case basis, the result of a rigorous yet arbitrary examination
  procedure. Proposals made in the late nineteenth century by colonial officials
  to establish agricultural colonies for the regeneration of the Indo-European
  poor had their parallel in the era of enlightened absolutism, when reformist
  bureaucrats in Prussia, Austria, and Russia championed, and at times
  established, colonies to train Jews in productive labor.
