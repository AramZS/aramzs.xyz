  Jewish intellectuals in nineteenth-century Europe may have felt that time was
  on their side, but they were nonetheless engaged in a vigorous campaign to
  refashion Judaism, not merely to be accepted into European society but also to
  protect Jewish life from the blandishments of both Christianity and
  secularism, to engage in a carefully thought-out process of imitation in order
  to prevent assimilation. The material conditions of life for European Jews and
  Asians differed greatly, as did the relations of power with the European
  hegemonic powers, but the thought processes of Jewish and Asian intellectuals
  were similar, including those that led to the development of nationalist
  ideologies. It is no surprise, then, that aspects of Zionism resemble
  anticolonial national movements, although there were spectacular differences
  as well.
