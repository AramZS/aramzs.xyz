  Ashkenazi Zionists, in turn, considered their Middle Eastern brethren to be
  degenerate yet improvable “human material,” to employ the commonly used term
  from the interwar period.19 Those who had been least exposed to Western
  influences (for example, the Jews of Yemen) were seen as petrified exemplars
  of the ancient Hebrews (Galapagos Jews, as it were). Precisely because they
  were believed to be true Orientals, however, Yemenite Jews were also perceived
  as “natural laborers” who could compete successfully with Arabs, performing
  backbreaking agricultural work at low wages. (With this goal in mind, in 1912
  the ZO’s Palestine Office recruited Yemenite Jews to immigrate to Palestine; a
  contingent of them labored on the lands of the Kinneret training farm, only to
  be summarily expelled in 1930 when the land was needed for new immigrants from
  eastern Europe.20)
