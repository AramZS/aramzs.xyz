  After 1948 the young State of Israel, like many countries in Asia and Africa,
  translated the anticolonialist rhetoric of victimization into a triumphant
  postcolonial discourse of technical planning and state socialism. Yet
  colonialist elements were present as well in the treatment of Israel’s Arab
  minority and state confiscation of its land.
