  Although Zionism has been overwhelmingly bent on separation from Arabs,
  Zionism has not developed elaborate racial categorizations that in South
  Africa were known as theoretical apartheid. And finally, the Zionist project
  featured many distinct qualities among settler-colonial ventures, for example,
  the concept of return to an ancient patrimony; the mission to foster mass
  migration of persecuted and impoverished members of a single community; the
  top-down construction of a new polity, national economy, and culture; and a
  zealous secularism (at least in its formative decades).
