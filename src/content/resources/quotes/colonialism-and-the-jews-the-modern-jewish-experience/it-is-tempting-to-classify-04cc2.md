  It is tempting to classify Zionism as a form of settlement colonialism not
  only because of the large numbers of Jews who immigrated to Palestine but also
  because of the speed with which they indigenized, that is, became rooted in
  the land and came to think of it as their native land (as opposed to an
  abstract, distant object of desire, a “holy land” or “land of their ancestors”
  to which they would return in messianic days).
