  It is certainly possible to employ the term “colonial” to describe not merely
  physical domination but also cultural hegemony, not governmentality but
  collective mentality, but if we are to do so then we must be willing to apply
  this concept to the historic status of European, and not only Mizrahi, Jews as
  a colonized people. Only then can we understand why Zionism, even when
  espoused by an Ashkenazi elite and suffused with colonial motifs, represented
  the ultimate phase of a European anticolonial discourse that dated back to the
  early nineteenth century.
