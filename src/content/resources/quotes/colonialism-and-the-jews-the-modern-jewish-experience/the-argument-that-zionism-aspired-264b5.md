  The argument that Zionism aspired from the start to displace the local
  population points to the Zionist national institutions’ assiduous purchase of
  Arab-owned land and restrictive access to it to Jews alone. Indeed, there are
  many documented cases, from the turn of the century through the 1930s, of
  Jewish land purchases causing the displacement of Palestinian peasants; yet
  the overall dimensions of the phenomenon are difficult to determine, as is the
  overall importance of displacement as opposed to other factors in the movement
  of Palestinian laborers from the countryside to the cities during the mandate
  period.
