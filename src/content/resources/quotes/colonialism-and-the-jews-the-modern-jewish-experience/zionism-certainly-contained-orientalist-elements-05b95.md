  Zionism certainly contained orientalist elements, and it constructed elaborate
  moral justifications for its colonization project. At the same time, its
  discursive framework differed from that of European overseas colonialism in
  intriguing ways—for example, in its assertion of familial propinquity, however
  distant, with the Arabs. As opposed to Joseph Conrad’s nightmarish vision of
  the corruption of the white man who journeys into the heart of African
  darkness, Conrad’s contemporary, the Hebrew writer Moshe Smilansky, presented
  Jewish contact with the Bedouin and Druze of Palestine as literally an
  ennobling experience.
