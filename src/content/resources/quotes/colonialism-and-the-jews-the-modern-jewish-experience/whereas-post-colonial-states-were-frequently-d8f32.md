  Whereas post-colonial states were frequently the creation of nationalist
  movements, postcolonialism, according to Robert Young, one of the subject’s
  most eminent scholars, “always operates as a form of internationalism” because
  nationalism, in his view, is inherently oppressive, and new tricontinental
  (Asian/African/Latin American) states that adopt European nationalist
  sensibilities and practices have internalized the evils of the oppressor.3 I
  do not share this view, which robs the anticolonial nationalist movements of
  the power of judgment
