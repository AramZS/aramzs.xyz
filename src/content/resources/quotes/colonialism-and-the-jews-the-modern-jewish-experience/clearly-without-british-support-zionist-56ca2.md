  Clearly, without British support, the Zionist project would have died in the
  cradle. Yet Britain’s role was inconsistent, vacillating between promoting and
  throttling the Zionist project. Britain was more a stepfather than a
  biological parent of the Jewish state. Thus, even critics of Zionism such as
  Daniel Boyarin and Gershon Shafir have acknowledged that the Zionist movement
  lacked a “mother country” and therefore defies simplistic association with
  European settlement colonialism.
