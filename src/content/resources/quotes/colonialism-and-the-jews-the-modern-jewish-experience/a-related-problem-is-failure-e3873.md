  A related problem is the failure to include additional categories of analysis
  such as anticolonialism (Zionism as an act of resistance by a colonized
  people) and postcolonial state building (understanding Israel within the
  political and economic framework of twentieth-century Asia and Africa). This
  essay contends that the Zionist project was historically and conceptually
  situated between colonial, anticolonial, and postcolonial discourse and
  practice. Colonial and anticolonial elements coexisted in the Zionist project
  from its inception until the creation of the state in 1948.
