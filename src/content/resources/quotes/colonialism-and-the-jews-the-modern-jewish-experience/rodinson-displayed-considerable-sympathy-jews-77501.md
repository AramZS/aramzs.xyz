  Rodinson displayed considerable sympathy with the Jews’ historic attachment to
  the Land of Israel, and he believed that the aspiration to return to Zion was
  not, in and of itself, tainted by colonialism. Nor did he identify Zionist

  nationalists did exactly the same thing in order to realize their own
  political aspirations.
