  the show’s use of satire and ridicule set the stage for others to use those
  weapons against the Klan. In years to come, national news broadcasters would
  invite hooded wizards and dragons onto their interview shows and let their
  ridiculous outfits and convoluted logic speak for themselves. Comedian Dick
  Gregory would develop a stand-up comedy routine ridiculing the Klan. It
  included this line: “A Klanner is a cat [slang for man] who gets out of bed in
  the middle of the night and takes his sheet with him.”
