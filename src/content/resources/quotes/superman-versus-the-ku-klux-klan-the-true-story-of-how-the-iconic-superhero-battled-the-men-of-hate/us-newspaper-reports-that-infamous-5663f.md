  U.S. newspaper reports that infamous Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels
  exploded in a meeting over the Superman anti-Nazi crusades were almost
  certainly exaggerated if not outright false. But it is true that Das Schwarze
  Korps, the weekly newspaper of the infamous Nazi Secret Service, denounced
  Superman. In April 1940 the paper ran the proclamation, “Superman ist ein
  Jude!” (“Superman is a Jew!”)
