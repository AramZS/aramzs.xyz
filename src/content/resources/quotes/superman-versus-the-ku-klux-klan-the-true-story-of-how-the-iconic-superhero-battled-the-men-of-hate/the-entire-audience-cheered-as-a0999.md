  The entire audience cheered as the Ku Klux Klan rode to the rescue of white
  womanhood, white power, and white supremacy. Finally the crowd breathed a
  final sigh of relief as the robed avengers dispensed with the threat by
  castrating and lynching the black villain. And the show did not end with the
  final scene. As the audience filed out of the theater, a bonus scene awaited
  them on Peachtree Street. More than a hundred men in white robes and hoods
  stood in military-style formation, rifles raised into the air. Thanks to the
  Little Colonel, the Ku Klux Klan was back—and this was no movie.
