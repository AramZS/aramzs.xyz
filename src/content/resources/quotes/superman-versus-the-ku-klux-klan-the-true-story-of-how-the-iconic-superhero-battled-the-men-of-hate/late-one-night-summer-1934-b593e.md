  late one night in the summer of 1934, the answer hit Jerry like a lightning
  bolt. They had it backward. The world had no need for an evil superman. The
  world needed a good superman—a trustworthy and powerful ally who would come to
  the rescue of regular people by protecting them from ruthless criminals,
  cheating businessmen, and corrupt politicians. With millions of people out of
  work, the streets full of crime, the stock market in ruins, and a war brewing
  in Europe, readers were starved for hope, inspiration, and a sense of power. A
  good superman could provide all that.
