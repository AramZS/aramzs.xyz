  list from Negroes, Jews, and Catholics to include union organizers, liberal
  politicians, civil rights advocates, crusading journalists, and supporters of

  putting people to work. As tensions rose, new recruits came forward to join
  the nation’s most militant defender of white protestant rule. Although the KKK
  recruited only members who were white and protestant, it boasted of standing
  for the principle of “100 percent Americanism.
