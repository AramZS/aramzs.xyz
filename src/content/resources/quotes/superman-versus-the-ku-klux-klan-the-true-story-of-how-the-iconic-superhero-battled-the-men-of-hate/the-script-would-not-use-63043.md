  The script would not use dialect or accents to distinguish characters by race,
  religion, or geographic region. This was not about condemning southerners or
  stereotyping minority groups. This was about teaching tolerance to millions of
  young listeners—and showing just how destructive prejudice could be. Even
  Superman’s heroics would be scaled back to allow the human characters to play
  heroes too. This would teach young listeners that ordinary people can stand up
  to bigotry.
