  Remember this as long as you live: Whenever you meet up with anyone who is
  trying to cause trouble between people—anyone who tries to tell you that a man
  can’t be a good citizen because of his religious beliefs—you can be sure that
  the troublemaker is a rotten citizen himself and a rotten human being. Don’t
  ever forget that!
