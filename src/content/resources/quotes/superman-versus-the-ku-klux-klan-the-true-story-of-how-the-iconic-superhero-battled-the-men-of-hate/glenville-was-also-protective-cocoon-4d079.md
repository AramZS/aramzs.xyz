  Glenville was also a protective cocoon for those residents—a safe haven from
  the prejudice that lurked just outside its borders. Sure, there were plenty of
  good, hardworking Christian people out there, but some Christians called Jews
  insulting names like kike and hebe and instructed their children to stay away
  from those kinds of kids. The classifieds in the Cleveland Plain Dealer were
  filled with job ads bluntly stating “No Jews Need Apply.” Country clubs in
  exclusive neighborhoods refused to accept Jewish members. There were even hate
  groups that called for the kinds of mass-removal programs that the Siegels
  thought they had escaped when they left Europe.
