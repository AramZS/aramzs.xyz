  Grand Dragon Green was elated with the Stone Mountain coming-out party. More
  than 200 new recruits had been initiated that night, and more than a thousand
  spectators had trekked up the mountain to witness the event. Major newspapers,
  national wire services, and a nationally circulated magazine had covered it,
  and most reporters had used adjectives like “eerie,” “mysterious,” “awesome,”
  and “haunting” to describe the goings-on.
