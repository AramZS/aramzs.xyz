  The all-American superhero reflected many of the beliefs and values of Jewish
  immigrants of the day. Like them, Superman had come to America from a foreign
  world. Like them, he longed to fit in to his strange new surroundings.
  Superman also seemed to embody the Jewish principle of tzedakah—a command to
  serve the less fortunate and to stand up for the weak and exploited—and the
  concept of tikkun olam, the mandate to do good works (literally, to “repair a
  broken world”). Even the language of Superman had Jewish origins. Before
  Superman is blasted off the dying planet of Krypton, Superman’s father,
  Jor-El, names his son Kal-El. In ancient Hebrew the suffix El means “all that
  is God.”
