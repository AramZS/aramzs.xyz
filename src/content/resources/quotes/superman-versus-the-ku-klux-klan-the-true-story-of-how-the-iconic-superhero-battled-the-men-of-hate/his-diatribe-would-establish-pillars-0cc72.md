  His diatribe would establish the pillars of an anti-comic book movement that
  would grow in intensity for decades to come. North was joined by even more
  vocal critics, including child psychiatrists, psychologists, educators, and
  political mavericks. In time the anti-comic book crusaders would carry their
  cause even further. They called upon district attorneys to appoint decency
  committees that would ban the most offensive publications. The crusaders even
  incited communities to sponsor comic book burnings outside public schools,
  where children collected thousands of comic books from their friends and
  tossed them into roaring bonfires. As the symbol of the genre, Superman was
  usually the first to burn.
