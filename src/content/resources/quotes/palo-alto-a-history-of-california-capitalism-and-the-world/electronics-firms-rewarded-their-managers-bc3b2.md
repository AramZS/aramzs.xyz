  Electronics firms rewarded their managers for controlling labor costs. It
  seems counterintuitive to pay some workers not to pay other workers, but by
  using stock options and grants to align professional employees’ interest with
  ownership, firms could provide a paternalistic atmosphere for high-value
  engineers while keeping the aggregate wage low enough to generate double-digit
  profits even as prices fell.iii
