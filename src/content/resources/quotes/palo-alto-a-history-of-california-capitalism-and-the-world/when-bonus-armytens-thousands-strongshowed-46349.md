  when the Bonus Army—tens of thousands strong—showed up at the Capitol looking
  to redeem their service-bonus certificates for cash, Hoover saw a Bolshevik
  military plot. The certificates were earning interest until their 1945
  redemption date, but the Depression left some people unable to wait, and the
  troops formed a motley crew, staging an event that was half protest and half
  bank run. The Chief didn’t see anyone worth negotiating with on the other
  side, and the administration convinced themselves that they were under attack
  by armed communist forces looking to repeat the storming of the Winter Palace
  in the Washington summer.
