  Before he went back to the transistor, Shockley wrote one more memo, the
  ominous “On the Economics of Atomic Bombing,” for a Vannevar Bush working
  group on nuclear weapons that became the Atomic Energy Commission.19 He opens
  by talking about the restriction of proportional war, in which any side must
  spend man-months roughly equivalent to the months destroyed on the other side.
  “This type of limitation,” he writes, “has been largely overcome by strategic
  bombing,” which, properly applied, does five months’ worth of damage for every
  month spent. He figured that atomic bombs were 10 to 100 times as efficient.
  “This cheapness is a new factor and indicates that an unparalleled loss of
  human resources will accompany future wars.” Following the idea to its logical
  conclusion, he writes, “leads to the picture of one man being able to unleash
  forces which would destroy the world.” Still, he concludes with that big
  number: Given 100x efficiency, 500, maybe 600 man-months are destroyed for
  every one spent. At that ratio, you could rule the world with a button.
