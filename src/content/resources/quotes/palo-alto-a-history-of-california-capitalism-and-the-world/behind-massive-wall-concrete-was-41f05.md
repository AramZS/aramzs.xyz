  Behind the massive wall of concrete was an ad hoc coalition of relatively
  petty West Coast construction capital. They called themselves “the Six
  Companies” after the Chinese associations in San Francisco during the railroad
  days, but they were closer to the original Associates. Most prominent among
  their number were Warren A. Bechtel and Henry J. Kaiser, and Hoover’s dam
  turned them into famous industrialists. The new Six Companies earned their
  place, building the project during the Depression with modern techniques and
  an all-American white male labor force—no union required, but Asian workers
  were banned by contract. The companies kept costs comparatively low in part by
  efficiently managing their workers’ whole lives at the site, though it wasn’t
  until a few years later that Kaiser figured out a way to incorporate
  health-care costs into his rationalized production equations by moving
  employees to a company medical plan.
