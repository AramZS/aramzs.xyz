  U.S. chip manufacturers kept pace with Japan by recruiting a global workforce
  of women. Firms offshored the vast majority of fabrication work to Mexico,
  South Korea, Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand while filling local
  manufacturing roles with Vietnamese and Filipina women. Domestically,
  employers relied on the pseudoscience of racial difference: They believed
  Asian women were less likely to organize for higher wages than Chicanas, whom
  they feared were susceptible to the era’s revolutionary rhetoric. “Small,
  foreign, and female” is how one manager described the qualifications for
  semiconductor production jobs.
