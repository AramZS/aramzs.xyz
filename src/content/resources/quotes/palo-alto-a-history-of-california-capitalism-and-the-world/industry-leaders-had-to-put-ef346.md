  Industry leaders had to put the win-win-win tech-economy fantasies aside;
  that’s not what the internet was for. After their capitalist predecessors
  spilled blood around the world to get them out from under obligations to
  anyone except their shareholders, these fluffy web companies were being too
  responsible.
