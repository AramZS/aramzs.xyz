  I think this post, though a joke on most levels, captures an important truth
  about Roko’s Basilisk. There’s no emerging artificial superintelligence that
  will automatically arbitrate the thoughts and claims of all people. There is
  just capitalism, an impersonal system that acts through people toward the
  increasing accumulation of capital, the amassing of exploited value. It’s not
  precise enough to say that Thiel has been at the right place at the right
  time. For capital, he is the right place. The historical forces acting through
  Thiel are much larger than his intentions; if there’s anything that sets him
  apart from his peers it’s that he understands that fact better than they do.
