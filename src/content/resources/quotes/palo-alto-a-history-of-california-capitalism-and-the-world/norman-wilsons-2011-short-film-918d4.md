  Norman Wilson’s 2011 short film, Workers Leaving the Googleplex, focuses on
  the same ScanOps contractors. In the grand NorCal tradition of labor-market
  segregation, these laborers carried unique yellow badges, though that was
  hardly necessary to mark them, Wilson writes: “It was the same group of

  They entered and exited at their own special scheduled times—4:00 a.m. and
  2:15 p.m.—
