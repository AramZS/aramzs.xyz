  The newest inventions and advances were for unused missiles. Making missiles
  and database systems was, if not morally repugnant, at least boring and
  pointless. Journalist Steven Levy writes that computers were “loathed by
  millions of common, patriotic citizens” who saw them as a “dehumanizing factor
  in society.”i3 The dull technophile engineer with a new stereo became a
  stereotype, and the Japanese commodity-electronics industry threatened from
  across the Pacific.
