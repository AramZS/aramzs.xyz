  When confronted by a Playboy interviewer about the privacy implications of the
  Gmail model, Larry and Sergey pitched it as a win-win. “Our ads aren’t
  distracting; they’re helpful,” Brin said.24 Page conceded that seeing ads
  related to the content of your mail was “a little spooky at first,” but all
  that free space was too good to turn down and users did get used to it. An IPO
  later that year gave Google a market cap of more than $20 billion.
