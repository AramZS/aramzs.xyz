  These funds—the significant discovered portion of Asia’s entire gold wealth,
  systematically extracted by Japanese gangsters commissioned by the army—served
  the Hoover clique as an anticommunist slush fund.x The Seagraves write that
  Hoover held $100 million in Japanese war gold in an account under his own
  name.42 His enduring cabal used the money to finance right-wing politicians
  (particularly in Japan), pay bribes, and ensure capitalist governance
  throughout Asia without burdening the Treasury or incurring oversight.
