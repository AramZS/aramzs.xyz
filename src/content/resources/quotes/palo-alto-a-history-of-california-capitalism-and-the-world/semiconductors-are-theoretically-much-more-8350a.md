  semiconductors are theoretically much more stable than vacuum tubes. In
  vacuum-tube triodes, the electrons float as gas, pulled across the void by
  magnetism. They lose energy as heat. They are big and heavy and vulnerable to
  jostling and altitude shifts, and they break frequently. The warmth and light
  attracted moths, the original computer bugs.
