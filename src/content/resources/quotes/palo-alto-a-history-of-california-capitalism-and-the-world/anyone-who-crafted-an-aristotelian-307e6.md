  Anyone who crafted an Aristotelian tragic narrative out of the 2008 crisis
  would have seen it as a correction for 10 years or so of financial-engineering
  shenanigans and irrational exuberance. But it was the investors who never read
  any Greek, the ones who were ready to roll the dice on the newly cheap housing
  stock, who made the right call. Some of the most extravagant financial
  instruments were done for, but housing prices rebounded nearly as fast as they
  fell.
