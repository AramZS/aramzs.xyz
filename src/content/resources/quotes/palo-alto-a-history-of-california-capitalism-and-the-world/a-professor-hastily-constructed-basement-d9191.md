  A professor in a hastily constructed basement jail taking notes while he pays
  out of the defense budget for one group of college students to torture another
  was a natural result of the Terman postwar plan for Stanford. So was a campus
  hospital full of 1,000 very, very quiet veterans swallowing whatever they were
  given. So was the personal computer. And all of it was war work in the global
  struggle against communism.
