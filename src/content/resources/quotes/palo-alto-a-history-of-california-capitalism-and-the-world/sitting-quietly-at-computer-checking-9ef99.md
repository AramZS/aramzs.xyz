  Sitting quietly at a computer and checking off typing tasks with a low error
  rate was a crucial twenty-first-century job skill, and SCORE! taught children
  to race up the mountain for pats on the head. The individualizing Suppes
  software made sure no students actually reached the top, where they could
  stop.
