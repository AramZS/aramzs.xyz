  It’s not clear how much the particular work of Cambridge Analytica ended up
  helping the Trump campaign. All the psychometric targeting based on
  personality characteristics sounds like bunk to me. But the campaign certainly
  made use of Facebook, running on the platform like one of Max Levchin’s
  annoying but prolific Slide apps.
