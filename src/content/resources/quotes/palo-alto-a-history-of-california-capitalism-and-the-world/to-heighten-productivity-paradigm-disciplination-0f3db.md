  To heighten productivity, the paradigm of disciplination is replaced by the
  paradigm of achievement, or, in other words, by the positive scheme of Can;
  after a certain level of productivity obtains, the negativity of prohibition
  impedes further expansion. The positivity of Can is much more efficient than
  the negativity of Should. Therefore, the social unconscious switches from
  Should to Can. The achievement-subject is faster and more productive than the
  obedience-subject. However, the Can does not revoke the Should. The
  obedience-subject remains disciplined. It has now completed the disciplinary
  stage. Can increases the level of productivity, which is the aim of
  disciplinary technology, that is, the imperative of Should.
