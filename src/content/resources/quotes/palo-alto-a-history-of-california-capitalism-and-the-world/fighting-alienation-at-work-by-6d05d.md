  Fighting alienation at work by making the workplace more fun, more personal,
  was a flexible way to attract workers and keep labor organizers at bay—these
  freebies were easier to withdraw in lean times, such as the early ’80s
  downturn, which briefly reached the Valley in ’82, than wages and promised
  benefits.
