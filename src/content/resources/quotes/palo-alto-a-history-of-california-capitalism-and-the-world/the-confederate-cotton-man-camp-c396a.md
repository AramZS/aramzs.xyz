  The Confederate cotton man Camp, who served as both president and treasurer of
  the AFC, favorably compared it to the Reconstruction-era Klan, an organization
  to which his father proudly belonged. In his view, both existed for the same
  singular purpose: “All we were organized for and all we tried to do and did do
  was fight communists.”
