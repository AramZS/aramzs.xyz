  In a sequence that I find hard to interpret other than as an act of collective
  punishment for the uprisings of the 1960s and early ’70s, California’s
  informally segregated, formally choked-of-funds public schools no longer
  prepared black and Hispanic students for the tertiary education required for
  technology jobs of any collar. Assembly-line managers preferred foreign-born
  workers, who had fewer rights than their American-born colleagues. Members of
  the region’s black working class found themselves, like an increasing share of
  the population in general, boxed into the low-wage service and informal
  sectors of employment.
