  The path from the vacuum-tube triode to the silicon integrated circuit was
  historically short—a matter of a few decades—and geographically even shorter.
  Hewlett-Packard managed to bridge the two technologies cleanly, and that
  stability amid the churning start-up seas helped make it the region’s
  signature firm, even as its followers overtook it in size. Unlike Litton or
  Varian, HP made it from the tube to the computer age on its own terms. More
  than Shockley or even Fred Terman, H and P were suited to the era.
