  The Portuguese Azoreans, for example, settled almost entirely in the Bay Area,
  where they took up truck farming for fruits and vegetables, as well as the
  operation of small chicken coops and dairies. “They would work for wages for a
  while, then rent land, and then finally buy land,” writes one historian,
  describing the familiar white-immigrant mobility narrative as the Bay Area
  Azoreans encountered it.24, 25 It was a workable plan, and thousands of
  Azoreans moved to the area in the 1860s and ’70s, edging Chinese truck farmers
  into seasonal wage labor.iii
