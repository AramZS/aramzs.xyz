  I don’t know what possessed Hewlett-Packard vice president Bill Doolittle to
  submit to an interview with members of the Resolution film collective for
  their 1974 movie, Redevelopment: A Marxist Analysis. By today’s corporate
  communication standards, what results is a disaster. Doolittle delivers a
  smirking monologue on the virtues of offshoring, which the filmmakers intercut
  with scenes of workers in Singapore. The monologue is fantastically concise
  and candid, and it’s worth quoting at length:
