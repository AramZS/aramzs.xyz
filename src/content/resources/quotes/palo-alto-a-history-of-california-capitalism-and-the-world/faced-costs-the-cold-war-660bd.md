  Faced with the costs of the Cold War arms race and the domestic demand for
  more social spending, government debts mounted. In October of 1975, the city
  of New York nearly defaulted, saved only by the teachers union, which reached
  into its pension fund.1 This situation led to what geographer David Harvey
  calls the “solution of the ’70s”: the re-empowerment of owners relative to
  workers after the uprisings at home and abroad via “unemployment and
  deindustrialization, immigration, offshoring, and all manner of technological
  and organizational changes (e.g. subcontracting).”
