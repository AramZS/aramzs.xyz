  Instead, they bullied him until he died. A heart attack took Baran’s life in
  1964 at the young age of fifty-four. He never got to see his masterwork,
  Monopoly Capital, written with Sweezy, published. Earlier that year, he
  complained to his writing partner, “For next year I got a teaching load that
  is about twice as large as that of my ‘peers,’ with pay of about 60 percent of
  theirs, and all this with a broad grin: ‘Look at us, how democratic and free
  and tolerant we are!’”
