  They knew their antenna design was about to go into production, and they knew
  it required the precision motors they created, which no one else had for sale.
  If the two of them spun off a precision-motor company, they could supply the
  joint venture, avoid turning into Westinghouse employees, and start building a
  new pool of equity. Moseley put in $25,000; Poniatoff put in $5,000 and agreed
  to run it. They split the company 50-50
