  Computerization didn’t add enough efficiency to the country’s classic
  manufacturing processes to keep them competitive. The U.S. tech strategy
  failed miserably in Vietnam, particularly as it was applied in strategic
  bombing and in the military’s effort to use sensors to render the battlespace
  calculable—never mind the LSD. The rapid Soviet ascent in science and
  technology, culminating in Sputnik, proved that there wasn’t anything special
  or inherently faster about the capitalist developmental road.
