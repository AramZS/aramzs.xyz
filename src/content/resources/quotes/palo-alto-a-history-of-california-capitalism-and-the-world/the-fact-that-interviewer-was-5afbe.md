  The fact that the interviewer was another Quaker doctor assuaged the family’s
  concerns and probably helped young Herbert squeeze his underqualified way into
  the inaugural class of Leland Stanford Junior University—they’re not called
  Friends for nothing. In 1891, when the Governor invited the pioneer class to
  Palo Alto and bestowed his son’s fortune upon them, spreading the family curse
  for good or ill, he was speaking to Herbert Hoover.
