  Capitalist technology is still a (re)colonial tool, and though newer, bigger
  missiles no longer seem like the magic formula for U.S. world domination, arms
  proliferation takes new forms. Thanks to the continued rise of finance capital
  and the regulatory conditions of the B2K internet, it doesn’t take a state
  effort or a globally curated team of geniuses to found a new high-tech weapons
  firm. “We live in a world where people don’t think conspiracies are possible,”
  Thiel told journalist Ryan Holiday, the implication being that such a
  perception makes it easier for him to get away with it.
