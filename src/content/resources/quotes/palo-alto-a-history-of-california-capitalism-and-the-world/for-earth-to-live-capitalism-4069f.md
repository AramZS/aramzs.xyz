  “For the earth to live, capitalism must die,” Nick Estes concludes, and in
  retracing a materialist history of that system, it’s hard to disagree.19 And
  if, against the odds, the earth’s partisans win that battle, if through the
  rapid coordinated flapping of wings we butterflies bring this chilly display
  case to a shattering concrete end, we will have fought it in collective
  self-defense, as a last resort.
