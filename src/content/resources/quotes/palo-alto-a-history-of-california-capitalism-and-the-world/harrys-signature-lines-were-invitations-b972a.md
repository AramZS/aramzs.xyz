  Harry’s signature lines were invitations to compete, the kind you offer with a
  gun. In 1978, a right-wing member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors
  and ex-SFPD officer named Dan White assassinated the city’s liberal mayor,

  the city’s gay community. Smirking conservatives turned the murderer White
  into a mascot.
