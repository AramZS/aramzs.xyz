  This cycle sucked borrowing countries dry. Once on the hook, countries had
  only one thing to offer their creditor nations and institutions: sovereignty.
  Taxes went to servicing debt instead of social spending; leaders sold off
  state assets; and national economies switched to low-wage export models of
  development in order to keep needed loans and investment coming in.
