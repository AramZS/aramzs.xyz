  But if Packard couldn’t win the war, then at least he could get a new low-wage
  group of employees. It’s not a coincidence that the South Bay maintains the
  country’s largest concentration of Vietnamese immigrants to this day: Silicon
  Valley firms were ready to absorb thousands of refugee workers at the same
  time and for the same reason they were refugees in the first place.ii War
  spending jump-started the civilian electronics industry both by funding R & D
  and by bombing a new cohort of Asian workers onto the California production
  lines.
