  “By the end of the 1960s,” writes economist Harry Braverman in his study of
  postwar shifts in the composition of the labor force, “rising rates of
  unemployment among ‘professionals’ of various kinds once more brought home to
  them that they were not the free agents they thought they were, who deigned to
  ‘associate themselves’ with one or another corporation, but truly part of a
  labor market, hired and fired like those beneath them.”
