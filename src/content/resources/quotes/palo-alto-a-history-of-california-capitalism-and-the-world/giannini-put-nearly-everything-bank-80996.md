  Giannini put nearly everything the bank had back to work. He invested in farms
  of course, but he also invested in housing developments and the extremely
  early motion picture industry, putting $500 into a San Francisco cornershop
  nickelodeon in 1909 and spotting $250,000 ten years later for Charlie
  Chaplin’s debut, The Kid.
