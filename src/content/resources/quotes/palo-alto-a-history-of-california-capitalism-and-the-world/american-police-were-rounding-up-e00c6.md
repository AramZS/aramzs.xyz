  American police were rounding up Japanese leftists and shipping them back as
  undesirable aliens to face imperial justice. Domestic antifascists were, of
  course, enemies of the state, and thousands were held in Japanese jails,
  according to the fiery rhetoric of San Mateo comrade Hoko Hideo Ikeda. WE MUST
  EVACUATE, he telegraphed to the funeral of San Francisco labor legend Tom
  Mooney in 1942 after racist restrictions prohibited his attendance, BUT
  WHEREVER WE GO WE WILL CONTINUE TO FIGHT THE FASCISTS.30 The LAPD Red Squads
  targeted Japanese antiwar protesters as they staged a sympathy demonstration
  outside the Chinese consulate. When a Japanese training ship docked in Los
  Angeles in 1929, communists distributed anti-militarist flyers to cadets; the
  Red Squads seized them back. American elites had more in common with their
  friends in the Japanese elite than with Japanese labor organizers, and they
  never forgot that.
