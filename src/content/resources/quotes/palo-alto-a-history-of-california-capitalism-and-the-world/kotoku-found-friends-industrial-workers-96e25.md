  Kōtoku found his friends in the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), or
  Wobblies, a revolutionary coalition of unions open to all laborers, which was
  founded the same year he arrived, 1905. Like the ultra-left factions in
  Germany and Russia, their idealized tactics were the general strike and the
  bomb, but the IWW was more like a militant labor union with big dreams than a
  revolutionary conspiracy. They scrapped with hired thugs at mines and sawmills
  throughout the West in particular. Compared to the craft workers of the
  American Federation of Labor (AFL), IWWers were rough-and-tumble, noted for
  getting in fights, moving around, and changing their names to escape bad
  reputations.
