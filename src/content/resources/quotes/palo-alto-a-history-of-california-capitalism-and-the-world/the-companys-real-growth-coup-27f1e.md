  The company’s real growth coup came when it scraped users’ contact lists and
  spammed them with invites. We will catch up with Zuckerberg and Facebook
  later, but it’s important to put the project in the context of web scraping,
  the relatively simple set of tricks that let one well-placed coder reach
  through the keyboard and touch the whole world. What happened then depended a
  lot on what the coder (or small team) had to offer the powers that be.
