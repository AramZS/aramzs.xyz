  In 2001, Apple bit—demonstrating once again the value of an incumbent seat
  when the finance music stops for a minute—but the company didn’t bring him
  in-house at first. Instead it contracted with Fadell to build the iPod and the
  iTunes software, and he contracted with subcontractors to supplement his team.
  When the iPod launched, however, it was Steve Jobs alone on stage, white
  device contrasted against his black turtleneck.
