  Tanton kept spinning off more dedicated organizations, including Numbers-USA
  (a “grassroots” version of FAIR) and the Center for Immigration Studies (the
  policy arm). If there has been any anti-immigrant effort in the United States
  between 1980 and today, it’s a virtual certainty that some part of the Tanton
  complex is involved.68 He died in 2019, living long enough to see a new
  generation of mainstream bigots like Stephen Miller and Kris Kobach pick up
  the reins.
