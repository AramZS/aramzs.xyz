  There is a grain of truth to the techno-optimist version of Amazon’s rise. It
  is not, however, True, not in the ways that are important for our larger
  story. Unlike some of its peers, Amazon found real production efficiencies,
  but firms can reduce their labor costs in more than one direction, and the
  Bezos company wanted all of them. That meant equipping workers with the latest
  and greatest in hardware and software to maximize their output. But as workers
  have always been quick to understand, maximizing output tends to suck.
