  Bert’s model was to get the federal government to set flight paths, research
  weather patterns, license pilots, and otherwise facilitate development in a
  general way. After some hemming and hawing about the “Air Dictator,” Congress
  gave him the go-ahead in 1926 with the Air Commerce Act. He worked with the
  Guggenheim family—Hoover had almost turned down the cabinet seat offered by
  Harding to join them in a mining partnership—after patriarch Daniel Guggenheim
  offered a $2.5 million fund to train aeronautical engineers, improve the
  technology, and push the industry as a whole forward in full cooperation with
  the Commerce Department in light of the agency’s new powers.18 They were the
  airplane Gianninis, bankrolling the industry’s shared expenses out of a
  combination of public and private interest, no government coercion necessary.
