  it’s objectively mistaken to see the Black Panther Party as a failure. It
  synthesized political currents from the Civil War and the Cold War, and the
  model it produced took the world by fire. In the Panthers’ analysis, they
  combined the psychological heat of anticolonial struggle with an ice-cold
  understanding of capitalism as a worldwide impersonal system. That’s what
  allowed them to uphold the seemingly contradictory truths of Black Power and
  Marxist universalism at the same time.
