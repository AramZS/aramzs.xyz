  It seems like a jump from the bionomists’ peace advocacy to their employment
  as military contractors in a march that culminated in nuclear war, but not
  from the perspective of the American blood-nation, as Jordan conceived of it.
  In both cases they were trying to protect the country’s genetic future as best
  they saw fit, whether by peace or by bomb. But Terman and his team didn’t know
  anything about bombs. To win the wars of the future, they needed to find the
  American geniuses of tomorrow, today.
