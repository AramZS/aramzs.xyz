  Ellison lobbied for a total government information system of digital ID cards
  linked to a central database, with thumbprint and iris scans. Optional for
  citizens, mandatory otherwise. He met with Ashcroft and apparently convinced
  him, because the attorney general nearly pushed it through, thanks to
  bipartisan support from Ellison’s senator in California, Dianne Feinstein.
