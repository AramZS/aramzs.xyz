  The corporate press (a repentant Hearst in particular) became increasingly
  hysterical, trying its best to marginalize the Reds as enemies of America and
  its people. But the press was a relatively weak tool, as Hoover found out
  during the run-up to the stock-market crash. What the ruling class needed to
  do was the same thing its enemies in the working class were doing: organize.
  “The radicals almost, almost took over,” recalled Bill Camp. “That caused the
  Associated Farmers to [come to] be.”49 With a name that evokes both Stanford’s
  Associates and Hoover’s associative state, the Associated Farmers of
  California (AFC) was a standing committee of California capitalists that
  existed to coordinate extralegal anticommunist activities in the agriculture
  industry and beyond.
