  Silicon Valley’s biggest winners are the slack-limbed puppets who have nailed
  their hands to these historical forces. Butterflies pinning themselves to the
  most opportune spots in the glass display box. Not the Wozniaks or even the
  Bezoses but the Airbnbozos whose defining feature is an eagerness to unleash
  forces they don’t understand onto as many people as they can, as fast as
  possible.
