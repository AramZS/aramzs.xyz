  To get us there, the B2K deregulation precedents combined with Democrat
  enthusiasm for businesses that, not for nothing, were making some powerful
  Democrats very rich. Nancy Pelosi, congresswoman for San Francisco, has led
  the caucus from 2003 to the time of this writing in 2022, with no plans to
  step down. Her husband, Paul, is a VC, and the couple has accumulated a
  nine-figure fortune. California’s senior senator, Dianne Feinstein, and her
  San Francisco investment banker husband, Richard Blum, built a billion-dollar
  set of holdings. And while the Obama administration prided itself on
  attracting high-paid tech workers to public service, Silicon Valley got a nice
  return. Every serious tech firm recruited a high-level White House staffer.
  Airbnb, dealing with a host of compliance issues, hired the country’s top
  law-enforcement official, attorney general Eric Holder. Even President Obama
  himself got a tech job, signing on to pick out some new movies for Netflix.
  Nice work if you can get it.
