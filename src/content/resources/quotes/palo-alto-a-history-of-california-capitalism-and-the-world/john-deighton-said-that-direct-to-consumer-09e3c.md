  John Deighton said that direct-to-consumer internet advertising was here to
  stay, but “home-delivered groceries? Never.”58 There was no way to compete
  with supermarket efficiencies. Deighton’s prediction was—not to belabor the
  point—wrong. But whereas the conventional narrative was that dot-coms drowned
  themselves in wasteful spending, Deighton did see that it was the relation
  between the internet and the real economy that needed to change.
