  After Hoover arrived in South Africa in 1904, Bewick, Moreing began shipping
  in tens of thousands of Chinese “coolie” laborers under the auspices of the
  CEMC, where Hoover remained a member of the board. This kind of racial
  arbitrage was standard operating procedure for Hoover; the Chinese gold miners
  cost Bewick, Moreing 45 cents a day compared to 60 cents a day for black South
  Africans.
