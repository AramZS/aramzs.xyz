  San Francisco exclusionists attempted to segregate Japanese children out of
  the city’s schools, causing an international crisis necessitating the
  intervention of President Theodore Roosevelt, who got the school board to back
  down and negotiated a deal with the Meiji emperor to confine the immigration
  of Japanese laborers to Hawaii. “The infernal fools in California, and
  especially in San Francisco, insult the Japanese recklessly, and in the event
  of war it will be the Nation as a whole which will pay the consequences,”
  Roosevelt told his son, presciently, but California’s Anglos kept pushing.
