  In the words of Stanford anthropologist Philippe Bourgois, who compared his
  field experiences in El Salvador and East Harlem, authorities were able to
  transmogrify the direct political and structural violence of class struggle
  into the decentered, depoliticized everyday violence of capitalist terror,
  under which the strong and lucky are forced to outrun their own families just
  to survive.xvii This formulation is structurally similar to the domestic new
  ideological admixture the Hoover Institution strategized to exploit through
  Reagan: Confuse class relations by foregrounding the individual. Capital-gains
  tax cuts accomplish that, and so does shooting into a crowd of civilians with
  a helicopter gunship.
