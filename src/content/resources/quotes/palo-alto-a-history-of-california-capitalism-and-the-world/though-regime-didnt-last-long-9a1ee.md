  Though the regime didn’t last long, the Trump meeting was a culmination of the
  Palo Alto System. For the first time, the regional industry was more than
  emergent; it represented the world’s highest concentration of value. No other
  meeting could gather anywhere near the same bulk of capital—not agriculture,
  not real estate, not manufacturing, not transportation, not munitions. Silicon
  Valley claimed its place at the center of the capitalist world, and its
  leaders pledged allegiance, not to Trump the man—obviously a clown—not to the
  White House or even to America. They pledged their allegiance to the
  impersonal historical forces that Trump represented, which happened to be the
  same ones raising them to their present heights. They pledged allegiance to
  themselves, and they pledged allegiance to Peter Thiel most of all. If anyone
  was in touch with the Coherent Extrapolated Volition of the capitalist class,
  he was.
