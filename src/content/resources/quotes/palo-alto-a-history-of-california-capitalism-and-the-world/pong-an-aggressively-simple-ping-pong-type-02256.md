  Pong, an aggressively simple Ping-Pong-type game hacked together by the lead
  Atari engineer, Al Alcorn, a former television repairman who knew how to get
  the most out of analog hardware. “The whole idea is to get the maximum
  functionality for the minimum circuitry,” Alcorn recalls. “It worked. We had
  $500 in the bank. We had nothing and so we put it out there.”
