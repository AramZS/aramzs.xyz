  LBJ, running to win the presidency that fell into his lap, had a chance to
  seat the integrated delegation, a chance to anoint Freedom Summer’s peace
  militants as his party’s future. It would have been a perfect origin story for
  the modern Democrats, a clean break with the segregationist past in favor of
  young black-led organizers who risked and sometimes lost their lives to gather
  votes for a party they couldn’t be sure even wanted them. That’s not what
  happened. Instead, the Democrats stuck with the Dixiecrats, turning their nose
  up at the sacrifices in Mississippi. When Mississippi organizer Fannie Lou
  Hamer appeared on the television broadcast to testify about her struggles to
  register to vote, the president intervened to get the camera off of her. It
  was a clean stab in the back from the national Democrats, and the bitter
  meeting determined the shape of America’s own decolonization struggle.
