  In 1994, scholar AnnaLee Saxenian described the results of the previous couple
  of decades in her comparative study of Silicon Valley and the Massachusetts
  tech industry: “There are approximately 200,000 union members in the
  four-county [Bay Area] region, but virtually none work in high technology
  industries. No high technology firm has been organized by a labor union in
  Silicon Valley during the past twenty years, and there have been fewer than a
  dozen serious attempts.”16 It was a brutal period for workers and a
  correspondingly excellent one for the men who employed them.
