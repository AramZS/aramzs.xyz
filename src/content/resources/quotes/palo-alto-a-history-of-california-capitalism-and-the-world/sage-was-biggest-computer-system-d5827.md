  SAGE was the biggest computer system of the time: Operators fed punch cards
  coded with the planned air routes of the day’s flights into the giant
  computers, and if radar hit on something that didn’t match up, operators could
  deploy missiles or aircraft to intercept what they had to assume was a Soviet
  nuclear bomber. SAGE stations had computers that connected across the country
  by modem and telephone line, a first. The system was a PR coup for IBM, which
  produced a 12-minute advertising video called “On Guard! The Story of SAGE,” a
  truly exceptional piece of Cold War propaganda, complete with Mom and Dad
  standing watch over their sleeping daughter: the parental dyad, a SAGE system
  of the home.xx According to SAGE engineer Lester Earnest, it also didn’t
  work—at all.xxi No one claims America ever used SAGE in action, but Earnest
  maintains that we never could have. He compares the system to Forrest Gump:
  “It was very fast, financially successful, and incredibly stupid.”65 For one
  thing, SAGE couldn’t handle radar countermeasures, which the Soviets were
  already using. For another, ICBMs replaced bombers as the go-to nuclear
  delivery device, and those went above radar into space. At best SAGE was a
  glorified air-traffic control system; at worst it connected nuclear missiles
  to buggy code and unsecured phone lines.xxii
