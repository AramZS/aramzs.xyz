  After George Creel lost the California gubernatorial nomination to the wacky
  socialist writer Upton Sinclair, he and FDR knifed the populist author. First
  they rewrote Sinclair’s platform to moderate it, then they cut a deal with the
  Republican incumbent, Frank Merriam, anyway—the same Merriam who called the
  machine guns to the San Francisco waterfront. Merriam trounced Sinclair, who
  waited patiently for the Roosevelt endorsement that never came.
