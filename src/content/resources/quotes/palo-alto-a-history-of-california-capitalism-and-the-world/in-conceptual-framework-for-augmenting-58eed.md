  In his conceptual framework for augmenting human intellect, Doug Engelbart
  posed the question of whom to augment first. His unsurprising conclusion was
  that computer programmers should be at the head of the line—specifically,
  those working on human augmentation, because the more they self-augmented, the
  faster they could produce further augmentations. They are “developing better
  tools for a class to which they themselves belong,” he wrote.13 (Engelbart saw
  this cycle as obviously virtuous, but today’s reader can detect other
  possibilities.)
