  Students at Boston University and Loyola University in Los Angeles destroyed
  school computers in the spring of 1969, in Boston with acid and wire cutters,
  in LA with what quickly became the preferred method: bomb. Analog files
  weren’t safe, either: The Catonsville Nine Catholic activists burned hundreds
  of paper draft files in a Catonsville, Maryland, draft board parking lot.
