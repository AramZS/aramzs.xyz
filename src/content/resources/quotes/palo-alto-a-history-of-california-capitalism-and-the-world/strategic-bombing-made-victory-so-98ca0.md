  Strategic bombing made victory so comparatively cheap that political changes
  anywhere in the world became subject to internal American deliberation.
  Washington was the capital of the free world, and soon that would be the whole
  world, an ever-vigilant bald eagle tucking the grateful planet into bed. Just
  one problem: It wasn’t really working.
