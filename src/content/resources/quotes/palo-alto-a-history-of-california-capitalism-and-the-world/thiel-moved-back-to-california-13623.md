  Thiel moved back to California for good in 1995, the year of the Netscape IPO.
  It was an exciting time to be a money guy with connections in Palo Alto, and
  the twenty-nine-year-old persuaded friends and family to give him $1 million
  to create the simply descriptive Thiel Capital Management.
