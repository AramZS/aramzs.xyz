  Some had more to work with than others, and that diversity of inherent and
  immutable ability was important and, they believed, understudied. Without a
  way to test for superior ability, identifying it in students was haphazard and
  unscientific, and so was public education in general. If intellectual capacity
  were a single genetic trait—and they believed it was—then it should be
  testable. Terman set about making it so, adapting a French intelligence test
  used to identify students who were falling behind. Against the explicit
  warning of the test’s author, Alfred Binet, Terman and his Stanford team
  reformatted it into a measure of inborn general intelligence, expressed in a
  single number, the ratio of “mental age” to actual age multiplied by 100.10
  From there Terman and company were off to the races, marketing
  “Stanford-Binet” tests, estimating the IQs of famous dead people, and looking
  for geniuses.
