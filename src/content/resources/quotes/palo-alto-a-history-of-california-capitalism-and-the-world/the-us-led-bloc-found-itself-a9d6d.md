  the U.S.-led bloc found itself a consistent defender of the Third World’s
  archaic authorities: priests, landowners, kings, sheikhs, chiefs, husbands,
  fathers. Suddenly many white Americans felt they had a stake in the world
  struggle. They mourned not just the draw in Korea but the victory of the Mau
  Mau rebellion against British colonial control of Kenya, a fight the United
  Kingdom lost in the mid-1950s despite its use of asymmetrical airpower. And
  though this concern manifested itself in ways most Americans now recognize as
  hysterical (exemplified in Stanley Kubrick’s Strangelove cabinet), the Red
  Scared whites weren’t exactly wrong.
