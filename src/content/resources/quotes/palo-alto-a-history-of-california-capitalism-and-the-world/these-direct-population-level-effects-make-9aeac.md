  These direct population-level effects make a mockery of the prevailing “Just
  say no” state rhetoric on illicit drugs, as the top-down global process of
  gangsterization makes the individual pathologization of crime look childish
  and silly. From a historical point of view, which individuals sell lattes and
  which sell eighths does not matter nearly as much as the broader patterns that
  constrain and produce those choices in the lives of particular people.
