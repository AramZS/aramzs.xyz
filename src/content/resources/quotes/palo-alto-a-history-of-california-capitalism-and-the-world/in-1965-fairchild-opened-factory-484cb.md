  In 1965, Fairchild opened a factory on the Navajo reservation in Shiprock, New
  Mexico, taking advantage of high unemployment with a low-wage “trainee”
  program and $700,000 in loans from the Navajo Nation.52 Scholar Cedric
  Robinson calls sites like Shiprock “production enclaves,” places where
  corporations “could be guaranteed special privileges and higher rates of
  exploitation.”
