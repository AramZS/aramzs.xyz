  Stolaroff’s solution wasn’t to give them computers; he wanted to give them
  LSD. The rest of the management committee at Ampex did not think dosing their
  top men with a powerful and ill-understood psychedelic was a good plan, but
  Myron was a true believer, and he had plenty of success in casual settings
  turning on friends from the informal but powerful Stanford engineering
  fraternity, including employees from HP and SRI as well as Stanford professor
  Willis Harman.
