  Some incumbents, like Ticketmaster and the RIAA, were strong and centralized
  enough to negotiate compromises, but a number of firms—industries, even—were
  not so lucky, and they got scraped away. John Ashcroft’s free-market
  authoritarianism structured the bargain between scrapers and the state
  regulators tasked with protecting people’s rights: The feds gave the data
  brokers a boost up and over the law, and the data brokers pulled the state up
  behind them.
