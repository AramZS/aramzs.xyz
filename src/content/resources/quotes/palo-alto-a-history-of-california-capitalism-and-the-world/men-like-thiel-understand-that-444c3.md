  men like Thiel understand that perception is serious business—just look at
  Theranos. Fear, uncertainty, and doubt, known in tech circles as FUD, can be a
  death sentence. In an industry where things don’t work until they do and the
  promotional cart usually precedes the product horse, the stakes are too high
  to let the press run amok.
