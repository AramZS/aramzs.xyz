  In 1908, San Francisco Koreans demanded a meeting with Durham Stevens, the
  Oberlin graduate foisted on the Korean government as a foreign affairs adviser
  by the Japanese, who was on his way to Washington, DC, to explain the
  emperor’s position. Stevens refused to retract a statement he made about the
  necessity of paternal control over the peninsula, and when he told the four
  Korean representatives that they had been gone too long to know what was
  really happening, they beat him with their chairs.
