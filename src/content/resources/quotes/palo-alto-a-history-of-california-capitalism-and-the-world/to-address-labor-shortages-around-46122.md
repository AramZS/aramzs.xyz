  To address labor shortages around World War I, contractors imported Mexican
  workers by the thousands. A number of them brought revolutionary military
  experience with them, and the global Marxist current was at least as strong in
  Mexico as it was in California. American military intelligence tracked Mexican
  communists through the CAWIU, singling out men such as Frank Samora (union
  secretary), Francisco Medina (chapter founder), and Fred Martínez (YCL
  organizer).40 Behind them were the Chicana-led networks that ensured the
  strikers lived to see another day, financing the effort with sweat and
  discipline. Prominent radical Filipino labor organizers such as Carlos Bulosan
  and Larry Itliong cut their teeth in the same California 1930s farmwork
  milieu. The planters’ depiction of the CAWIU as Mexican and Filipino workers
  misled by communists is belied by the obvious fact that a handful of
  underfunded outside agitators couldn’t possibly have organized California’s
  Spanish- and Tagalog-speaking agricultural workers the way the CAWIU did.
  Rather, Party organizers like Darcy and Decker eschewed the top-down turn in
  Moscow and fit themselves to the diverse rank-and-file tradition of California
  communism.
