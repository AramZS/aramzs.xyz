  In a mere 25 years, Jordan’s plan transformed the town from a frontier
  university hamlet to a postindustrial center where men invented the tools that
  shaped the aerospace, communications, and electronics sectors and the era of
  American global domination they enabled. The university as led by Jordan
  nurtured industry with facilities, equipment, money, and, most important,
  human beings.
