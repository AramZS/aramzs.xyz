  What if, instead of stories about Oedipal family disputes and youthful
  self-expression, or even instead of legislative compromises arcing toward
  justice, we saw the interrelated U.S. campus, antiwar, and civil rights
  movements of the postwar period as part of the global struggle against
  domination by Western capital? A lot of things start to make sense, such as
  why the Black Panthers sold Mao’s little red book, trained in Algeria, and
  escaped to Cuba. And why campus radicals flew the North Vietnamese flag. And
  why Malcolm X wanted to take black people’s case to the United Nations instead
  of to the White House. For U.S. rebels in the third quarter of the twentieth
  century, decolonization started at home.
