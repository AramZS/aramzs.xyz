  “The easiest way for Americans to make sense of Chinese history is to compare
  everything to Jewish history,” writes Eddie Huang in his memoir Fresh Off the
  Boat, about growing up as the child of Taiwanese immigrants in the suburban
  America of the 1980s and ’90s.40 But the easiest way is probably not the best,
  and the striver story we get about Jews is already too simple.
