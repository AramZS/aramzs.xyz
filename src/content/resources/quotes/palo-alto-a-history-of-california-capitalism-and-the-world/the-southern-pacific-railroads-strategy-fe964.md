  The Southern Pacific Railroad’s strategy of importing vulnerable workers from
  abroad became integral to California’s particular mode of production. Growers
  paid their workers by race, segregating them according to pseudo-scientific
  ideas about capacity and the intricate matrix of legal rights allotted to
  Americans by race, ethnicity, gender, immigration status, and national origin.
  When new profit opportunities arose, growers gathered foreign laborers; when
  the profit rates attenuated, the state expelled them.
