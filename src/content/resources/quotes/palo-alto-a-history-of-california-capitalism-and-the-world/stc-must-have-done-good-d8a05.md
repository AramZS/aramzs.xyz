  STC must have done a good job, because soon after, in 1976, the company was
  approached by a man named Frank Terpil. He said he was an active CIA agent,
  and he was there for a job. An STC executive claims that the agency, when
  asked, didn’t say Terpil wasn’t an agent, and so the partnership hired him,
  and he brought on his fellow not-so-ex-CIA pal Ed Wilson. As a CIA affiliate,
  Stanford Technology expanded its business.
