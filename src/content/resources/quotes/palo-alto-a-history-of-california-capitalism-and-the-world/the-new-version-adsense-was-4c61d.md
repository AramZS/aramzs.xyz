  The new version of AdSense was so successful that the firm created a version
  that allowed third-party sites to post Google-run ads, too. Despite the host
  of exotic commercial fields Google has entered since, as well as the company’s
  reorganization under the Alphabet holding entity, Google advertising still,
  almost 20 years later, provides more than 80 percent of the conglomerate’s
  revenue.
