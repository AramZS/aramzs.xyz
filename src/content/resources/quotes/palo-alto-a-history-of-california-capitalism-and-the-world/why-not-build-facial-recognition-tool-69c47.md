  Why not build a facial-recognition tool for the Trump administration, one that
  the “deportation squads” could use to hunt undocumented immigrants? Johnson
  teamed up with Hoan Ton-That, a Vietnamese-Australian spam coder who was also
  a Gawker target. It was a long shot, a fascist troll fantasy. “It was a joke,”
  the silent partner, Johnson said, “but it became real.”84 Thiel gave them
  $200,000, and the team added Richard Schwartz, a conservative who went from
  attacking the New York City welfare system as a politician to running an
  employment contracting firm for welfare recipients. The new company was called
  Clearview AI, and the founders kept the ultra-right agenda under wraps while
  they scraped billions of photos from the web.
