  It was soon apparent to the Jordan administration that, despite the headline
  news of his hiring, Har Dayal was not a good fit for Stanford after all. The
  tipping point seems to have been Jordan’s receipt of notes from a Radical Club
  meeting on the topic of “heroes… who have killed rulers and dynamited
  buildings,” but apparently the decision to part was mutual. At that point
  Stanford classes were the least important part of Har Dayal’s work. A month
  after he left his position at the school, he launched the Fraternity of the
  Red Flag, an IWW-inspired revolutionary association committed to communism as
  well as the abolition of racism, patriotism, private property, marriage,
  government, religion, and metaphysics.
