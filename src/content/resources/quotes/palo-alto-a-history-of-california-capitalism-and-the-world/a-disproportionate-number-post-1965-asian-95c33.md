  A disproportionate number of post-1965 Asian immigrants gravitated toward
  small-business ownership for a whole slew of reasons: If they bought one,
  immigration rules permitted individuals to enter the country regardless of
  their point-system scores; small businesses allowed families to informally
  employ their own members at low wages, lending the enterprises a competitive
  advantage; as their own bosses, immigrants didn’t exaggerate the necessity of
  English language skills, as an anglophone employer might; members of a
  generation of white ethnic small-business owners were nearing the ends of
  their lives after having successfully assimilated their children into
  professional jobs and felt compelled to sell their shops; educated
  professionals who couldn’t traverse the American credentials system had access
  to modest loans and pooled capital from their community networks; suburban
  expansion in the South and West created demand for small concerns to fill out
  the new strip malls. Low-capital, labor-intensive businesses such as
  restaurants, doughnut bakeries, small groceries, auto-repair garages,
  newsstands, motels, nail salons, liquor shops, and convenience stores were
  viable enough, but small profit margins meant that self- and family
  exploitation was the only way to make any money. Ronald Takaki calls it an
  “opportune moment” to become a shopkeeper, and yet he also notes that a “study
  of Korean business owners showed that more than 90 percent of them worked
  harder and lived more frugally here than they had in Korea.”
