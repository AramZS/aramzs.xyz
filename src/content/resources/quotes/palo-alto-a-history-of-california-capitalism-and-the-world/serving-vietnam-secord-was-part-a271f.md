  Serving in Vietnam, Secord was part of a CIA apparatus that flew planeloads of
  gold into Laos and bribed tribal groups to join America’s efforts. To
  incorporate these groups into the world market as fast as possible, U.S.
  operatives helped expand regional opium production and hooked up smuggling
  lines, including avenues to American troops, who then directed the contraband
  into the United States, where it had a deleterious effect on U.S. city life.
