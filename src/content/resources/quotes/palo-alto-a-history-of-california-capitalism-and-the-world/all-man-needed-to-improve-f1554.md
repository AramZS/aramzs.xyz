  All a man needed to improve the world was an uncompromising dedication to
  profit and the capital to realize the necessary scale. Stanford had both, and
  he created Palo Alto to house them. The twin whips of science—data and
  control—sped money around its circuit like colts around the kindergarten
  track, accumulating valuable mass with every lap.
