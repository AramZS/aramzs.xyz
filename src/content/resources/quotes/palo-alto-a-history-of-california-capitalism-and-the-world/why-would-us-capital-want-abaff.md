  Why would U.S. capital want to go to Asia at the same time as Asian capital
  wanted to come to the United States?x One reason is that the very political
  stability achieved through immigration made the capitalist East safe for
  foreign investment. And for the ruling class in the various Yankee-aligned
  dictatorships, there were downsides to investing their extracted gains in the
  expansion of domestic production: It’s too easy to tax and confiscate, and
  it’s too hard to grab and run.
