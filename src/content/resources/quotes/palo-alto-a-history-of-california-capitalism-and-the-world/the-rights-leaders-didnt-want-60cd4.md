  The right’s leaders didn’t want a Herbert Hoover with strong new ideas about
  how the world should work; they wanted someone to sell the ideas developed in
  the think tanks, using marketing from the advertisers. They wanted a brand
  ambassador for free-market capitalism, individual rights, and anticommunism.
