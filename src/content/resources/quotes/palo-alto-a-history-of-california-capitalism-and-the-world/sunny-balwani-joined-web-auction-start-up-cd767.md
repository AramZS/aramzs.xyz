  Sunny Balwani joined the web-auction start-up CommerceBid in 1999 and it sold
  to bankruptcy-bound Commerce One the same year for a couple of hundred million
  dollars’ worth of stock, of which Balwani was entitled to a substantial
  chunk.4 It was a very lucky series of events, but as the reporter John
  Carreyrou writes, “Sunny didn’t see himself as lucky. In his mind, he was a
  gifted businessman and the Commerce One windfall was a validation of his
  talent.”
