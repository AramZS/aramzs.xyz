  a fable that capitalists adopted from the Stanford eco-racist anti-population
  milieu: the “tragedy of the commons.” In six pages published in the journal
  Science in December of 1968, the Stanford-trained ecologist Garrett Hardin
  asserted that the public “commons” was by its nature subject to abuse by
  maximizing actors. A bigot and cofounder of the anti-immigrant group FAIR,
  Hardin was worried about population specifically. “In a welfare state,” he
  begs the question, “how shall we deal with the family, the religion, the race,
  or the class (or indeed any distinguishable and cohesive group) that adopts
  overbreeding as a policy to secure its own aggrandizement?”18 One step away
  from neo-Nazism, this rhetoric wore the cloak of environmentalism during the
  Nixon years, but by the time of the Reagan administration, the musing
  philosophy paper that had no business in a scientific publication in the first
  place had ballooned to an existential truth that applied to public goods in
  general. As the economy advanced, the state had to “enclose” an increasing
  number of commons to make sure they weren’t misused, either by
  overexploitation or, just as concerning, underexploitation, since, as we know,
  capital is reluctant to enter new markets where it can’t protect its initial
  position. This represented a change in the ideology, from recognizing the need
  to build up an intellectual-property commons for new industries to creating
  the best investment climate possible by constraining the spread of new tech.
