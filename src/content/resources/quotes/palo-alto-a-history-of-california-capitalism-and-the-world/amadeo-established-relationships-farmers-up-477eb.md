  Amadeo established relationships with farmers up and down the state, mailing
  cold-call letters. He encouraged Lorenzo to make small loans to the farmers
  they worked with and to use the company’s knowledge of the urban market to
  nudge them toward profitable planting decisions. The more Scatena and company
  behaved like investors, the more they turned truck farmers into specialized
  suppliers, which allowed them to scale up their plots.
