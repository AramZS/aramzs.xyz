  Having expanded greatly in the previous decades, in the late 1970s the state

  New Left campus movement to an attack on students in general.98 Tuition and
  fees at the University of California system doubled in the ’80s, then tripled
  in the ’90s.99 Right-wing lawyers attacked affirmative action, posing
  individual white claims against black group claims. In the landmark Bakke
  ruling of 1978, the Supreme Court struck down the UC system’s racial
  admissions quotas—themselves a compromise with the open-admission demand from
  the Third World student movement—which steered liberation struggles toward an
  individual anti-discrimination orientation. Backed by campus reactionaries,
  school administrators relaxed their inclusion efforts.
