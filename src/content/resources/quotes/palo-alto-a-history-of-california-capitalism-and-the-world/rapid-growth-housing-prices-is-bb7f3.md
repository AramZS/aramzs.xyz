  Rapid growth in housing prices is a global phenomenon: It’s not a bet that
  people with good jobs will continue to want to buy their own homes; it’s a bet
  that capitalists won’t have anything better to do with their money than
  speculate on an intrinsically scarce resource such as land. That has been a
  very good bet.
