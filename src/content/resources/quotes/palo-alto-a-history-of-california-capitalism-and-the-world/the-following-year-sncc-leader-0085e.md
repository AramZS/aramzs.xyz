  The following year, SNCC leader Stokely Carmichael gave an inflammatory speech
  at Seattle’s de facto segregated Garfield High in front of a crowd of 4,000,
  calling for black people to resist the draft. “So you tell them they better be
  happy with Dr. King, ’cause when some of us get guns, we know who we going to
  kill,” he told the crowd. “Our guts and blood have been spilt for this country
  and we go to the worst schools this country can produce! We who have spilt our
  guts and blood for this country. Our guts and our bloods have been spilt for
  this country, it’s time we spill them for our people.”
