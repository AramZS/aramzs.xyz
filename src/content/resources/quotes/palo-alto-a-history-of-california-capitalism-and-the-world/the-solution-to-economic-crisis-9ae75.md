  “[T]he solution to the economic crisis of the end of the war turned out to be
  simply not letting the war end,” writes historian Walter Johnson.51 The Cold
  War was a real, long war, and millions of people died. To speak of the
  American “postwar” economy or state into the 1950s is not to talk about a
  country at peace, but a country finished with peace altogether, a nation that
  has embraced a permanent conflict.
