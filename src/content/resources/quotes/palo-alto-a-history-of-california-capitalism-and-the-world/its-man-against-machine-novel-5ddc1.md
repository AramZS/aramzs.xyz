  It’s man against machine, but the novel is politically clueless. Whereas the
  rebels are alienated white men (and one mute Indian), the proverbial Man is an
  overbearing nurse, backed up by her black “boy” orderlies. McMurphy’s uprising
  is about the men reclaiming their masculinity in the face of a castrating
  state authority.
