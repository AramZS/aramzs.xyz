  One of the factors that made military export deals like these so appealing was
  the corruption. Everyone in the chain marked up their costs and tucked
  something extra into their pockets, which was easy to do at electronics
  companies, whose products were high-margin and poorly understood by anyone who
  didn’t already have their own stake in the sales.xiii
