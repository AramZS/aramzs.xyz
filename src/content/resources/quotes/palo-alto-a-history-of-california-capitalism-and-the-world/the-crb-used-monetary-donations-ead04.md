  The CRB used monetary donations from the Allied governments to buy foodstuffs
  on the global market, ship them to Belgium, and distribute them to Belgian
  communal authorities, who then sold most of them to local shops, which in turn
  sold them to the customers who were still liquid enough to buy stuff under
  German occupation. The remainder went to canteens for the destitute. As
  before, Hoover’s team worked hard to maintain functioning markets above
  all—and with them a class structure—in the face of leveling catastrophe.
