  When two bureaucrats came to Palo Alto to tell Packard that the firm fell on
  the wrong side of regulations against excessive profits, he chewed them out
  about the free market, appealed above their heads, and got an agreement with
  “virtually everything we asked for.”4 Once again, Roosevelt’s agents and the
  social democratic agenda found themselves nullified in California’s
  Hooverville.
