  Despite his academic adviser’s denial, Hoover was extremely lucky by any sort
  of standard. The $20,000 a year (plus expenses!) he was making by age
  twenty-five is over $675,000 in 2022 dollars, and he was already used to the
  burden of command. Like Leland Stanford, Hoover stuck with a favorite title
  throughout his life, but it wasn’t President or Director; it was Chief, which
  is what miners traditionally called their bosses.
