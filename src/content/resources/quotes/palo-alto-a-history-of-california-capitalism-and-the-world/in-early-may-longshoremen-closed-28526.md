  In early May, the longshoremen closed the port of San Francisco; by the end of
  June, the city’s leaders and employers had had enough. On July 5, 1934, the
  bosses tried to break the picket under the guns of the city police and the
  National Guard, which Governor Frank Merriam called in. Open warfare erupted
  on the waterfront. Ignoring the informal rules of a picket fight, police
  attacked union headquarters, drenching the Embarcadero in tear gas. One
  policeman fired into the crowd, killing strikers Howard Sperry and Nick
  Bordoise.
