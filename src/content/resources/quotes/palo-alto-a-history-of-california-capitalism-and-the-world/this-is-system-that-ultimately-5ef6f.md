  This is the system that ultimately won the Cold War; it was guaranteed to turn
  any Third World country where the people were considering socialism into a
  massacre site, and at prices that weren’t about to trigger a domestic
  inflation spiral. It ultimately worked well enough in Nicaragua, but the
  strategy was more effective to the north, where Honduras and El Salvador
  suffered what were later categorized as human rights violations at the hands
  of right-wing soldiers and paramilitaries, which kept the countries in the
  United States’ sphere of influence.
