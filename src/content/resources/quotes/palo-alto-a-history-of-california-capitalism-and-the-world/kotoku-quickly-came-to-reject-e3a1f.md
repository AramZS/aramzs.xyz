  Kōtoku quickly came to reject ineffective parliamentarianism and embrace
  bomb-throwing anarchist insurrectionism as the only solution to the problem of
  empire. The Social Revolutionary Party wasn’t based on the Germans, it was
  based on the Socialist Revolutionary Party of Russia, whose members, called
  SRs, sought the overthrow of the czar and the redistribution of royal land.
