  It’s important to see Thiel as a product of Reagan’s reactionary California
  suburbs and the Hooverite intellectual conspiracy undergirding them, including
  organizations such as FEE, the AEI, the Mont Pelerin Society, and of course,
  the Hoover Institution. He came of age in the gentle arms of the cohort of
  active conservative donors that built on these foundations, the ones who
  funded the various Reviews, whose beneficiaries fought the campus PC wars,
  and, after graduation, sabotaged the Clinton administration. Like Dave Packard
  paying Hoover’s conspiratorial army of flying monkeys with their associations
  and foundations, Peter Thiel quietly funds a wide variety of ideological
  projects. His introduction to writing seven-figure checks to the ultra-right
  was a $1 million donation to Numbers USA, part of the openly racist,
  anti-immigrant Tanton network and an outgrowth of Ehrlich and company’s zero
  population growth.76 Thiel took the baton from generations of Stanford
  racists.
