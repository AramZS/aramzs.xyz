  A one-page essay in the seventh issue of Declassified makes the explicit
  argument for popular control over technology: “The university is deeply
  involved in production for private profit,” the authors write. “It produces,
  often at public expense, skilled labor and scientific knowledge. This
  university isn’t a temple of the intellect or a place where disinterested
  scholars examine the world. It is a center for the development of knowledge
  and resources for human use.”
