  Bannon was steering the boat, and he had grander aspirations. Republicans were
  at a severe data disadvantage compared to Democrats, and the Obama campaign
  extended that lead. Bannon wanted to close the gap and, by curating his
  clients, push a hard-right nationalist culture-war agenda within the GOP. The
  B2K world of online data could be his killer app.
