  Edwards helped organize his students so they could improve their treatment at
  the school, and they forced the cancellation of a football game—the ultimate
  act of university sabotage. Governor Reagan wanted to send in the National
  Guard to police the field; the RAM milieu offered Edwards its own guerrillas
  if need be. But the school had to face a hard truth: It couldn’t operate
  without the participation of black students. The game was not played. The
  “revolt of the black athlete,” to quote the title of one of Edwards’s books,
  that began in San Jose and spread across the country attracted international
  attention and embarrassed the American government, which from the state’s
  perspective defeated the whole point of international sport.
