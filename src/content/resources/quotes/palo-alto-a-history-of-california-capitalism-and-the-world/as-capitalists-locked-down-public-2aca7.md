  As capitalists locked down public resources through privatization, tax
  evasion, and austerity, the high-growth technology industry hardened its
  defenses, erecting literal and metaphorical walls between the people and
  computer power. “Such elaborate precautions may have appeared unnecessary up
  to now to the managers of most computer installations,” a security consultant
  told Computerworld in 1970. “But with the growing unrest in the country, the
  increasing sophistication of saboteurs, and the potential that computers offer
  for easily inflicted and costly damage, major precautions are necessary for
  data processing managers to fully protect their computers.”102
