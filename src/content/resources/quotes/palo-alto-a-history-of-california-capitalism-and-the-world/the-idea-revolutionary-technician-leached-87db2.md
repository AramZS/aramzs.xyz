  The idea of the revolutionary technician leached into the mainstream in
  unpredictable ways. Stephanie Rothman’s low-budget soft-core erotica The
  Student Nurses (1970) depicts a nursing student who falls for a Chicano
  militant and turns down a hospital job in order to bring medicine to the
  people. “Who’ve you been shacking up with, Chairman Mao?” her friends tease.
  “Where’s your gun?” “In the glovebox!” she answers. “Wanna see?” The girls
  walk away together, still laughing, but not joking. The film includes an
  extended anti-imperial street theater performance by El Teatro Popular, a real
  Valdez-inspired group from Los Angeles.
