  What might be a call for internationalist conciliation is nothing of the sort.
  Competition and domination, exploitation and exclusion, minority rule and
  class hate: These aren’t problems capitalist technology will solve. That’s
  what it’s for. In the proper language, they are features, not bugs. This was
  Jordan’s plan, Hoover’s plan, Shockley’s plan, and now it’s Thiel’s.
