  In 1982 in Detroit, two white auto-workers made headlines when they beat a
  young Chinese immigrant named Vincent Chin to death. In January of 1989, a
  gunman opened fire at a Stockton, California, elementary school, murdering
  five Cambodian and Vietnamese children and wounding dozens more. These
  shocking public instances stood for a deeper climate of order-maintaining
  white violence that crowded the full range between a lawful increase in
  imprisonment and individual hate crimes.
