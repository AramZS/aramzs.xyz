  President Hoover put the question in racial and political terms. “There can be
  no fear for a democracy or self-government or for liberty or freedom from
  homeowners no matter how humble they may be,” he told the 3,000 delegates,
  contrasting owners with renters and tenement dwellers, who have less to lose.
  “That our people should live in their own homes is a sentiment deep in the
  heart of our race and of American life.”
