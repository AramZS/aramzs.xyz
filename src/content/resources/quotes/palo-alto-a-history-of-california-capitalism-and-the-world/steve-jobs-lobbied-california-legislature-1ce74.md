  Steve Jobs lobbied the California legislature and the governor, Jerry Brown,
  for a bespoke tax credit: 25 percent of the purchase price for every computer
  donated to schools. In 1983, he offered each of the 9,250 eligible schools in
  the state an Apple IIe system, and almost all accepted.47 The company’s huge
  profit margin combined with the offsetting tax credit meant that Apple was
  paying an estimated 5 percent or less of the ostensible bill—and that’s just
  what the company said publicly.
