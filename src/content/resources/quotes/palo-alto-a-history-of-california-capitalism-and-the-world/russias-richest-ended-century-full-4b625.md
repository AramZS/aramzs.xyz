  Russia’s richest ended the century with a full counterrevolutionary reversal
  of their fortunes, propelling their income share above what it was before the
  Bolsheviks took over. To accomplish this, the country’s new capitalists
  fleeced the most vulnerable half of their society. “Over the 1989–2016 period,
  the top 1 percent captured more than two-thirds of the total growth in
  Russia,” found an international group of scholars, “while the bottom 50
  percent actually saw a decline in its income.”
