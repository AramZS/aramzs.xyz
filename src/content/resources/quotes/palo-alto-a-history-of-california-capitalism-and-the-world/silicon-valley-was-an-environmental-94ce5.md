  Silicon Valley was an environmental hazard, with workplace injury rates twice
  as high as they were in general manufacturing, mostly because of the
  prevalence of toxic chemicals.17 As members in an environmental justice
  coalition with local liberals (including a smattering of homeowners), labor
  organizers could pursue pro-worker ends without triggering the union alarms at
  the AeA. The Santa Clara Center for Occupational Safety and Health formed
  thanks to the efforts of three women: Robin Baker, Amanda Hawes, and Pat
  Lamborn, only one of whom was a production worker. The group leveraged new
  nationwide concerns about how pollution was affecting American families to
  lobby for safer labor practices.
