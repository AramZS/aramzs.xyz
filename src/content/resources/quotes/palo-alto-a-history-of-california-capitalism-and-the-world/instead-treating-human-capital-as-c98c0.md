  Instead of treating human capital as a national resource the way David Starr
  Jordan and company first planned it, America’s new leaders applied Garrett
  Hardin’s tragic-commons logic: If they were giving it away, people would go to
  school and, say, invent radical new theatrical art practices instead of
  building bombs like they were supposed to. With education enclosed, on the
  other hand, the market could properly value it and ensure its best use.
