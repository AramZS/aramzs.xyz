  CORROSIVE SOCIAL CEMENT. The flow of drugs into Silicon Valley completed a
  productive circuit: California exported microchips and imported drugs; the
  drugs powered the labor that went back into the microchips; and so on. With
  every circulation, capitalists strengthened themselves in relation to workers
  by peeling off a growing share. The drugs were part of the corrosive social
  cement, binding populations together in the acid embrace of dispossession.
