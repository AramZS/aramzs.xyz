  An enthusiast of life-extension technologies, Thiel will get full access to
  his Roth IRA and the tax-free billions inside it in 2032, barring any changes
  to the law (which he would surely fight tooth and nail). The statute is
  written the way it is because sixty-five is supposed to be the age of
  retirement; Thiel barely considers it middle age. He is playing the long game,
  but at a time of global upheaval, he knows he can’t afford to go too slowly.
