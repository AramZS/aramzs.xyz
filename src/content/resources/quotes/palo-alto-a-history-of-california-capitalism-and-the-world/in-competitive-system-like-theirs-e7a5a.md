  In a competitive system like theirs, restrictions only serve to help
  distinguish those who can figure out how to surpass them, people for whom Can
  and Should collapsed—men like Dave Packard, who wouldn’t accept state limits
  on his profits, and Steve Jobs, who wouldn’t accept anything at all he didn’t
  like. They’re the ones who set the pace, for the town, the country, and the
  world.
