  YAF brought the “disorder in defense of order” tradition to college campuses;
  a rejuvenated Klan claimed responsibility for patrolling the southern border;
  the ultra-right John Birch Society reveled in Reagan’s victory; a hard
  reactionary subculture polarized itself against nonwhites, leftists, women,
  and queers, claiming that compensatory demands and the rigged labor-state
  crowded out individuals—hard-working, skilled, yet humble white male
  individuals who only wanted a fair shot. The amount of power American whites
  were willing to surrender to their black compatriots was not sufficient to
  yield social peace, but the idea of their increased taxes going to fund social
  programs that paid and trained anti-American black communist revolutionaries—a
  genuine phenomenon in California, as you’ve read—was more than some patriots
  could handle.
