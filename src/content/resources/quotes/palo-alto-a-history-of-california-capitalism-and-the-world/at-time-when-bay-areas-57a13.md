  At a time when the Bay Area’s artists began toying with Japanese ideas and
  forms, artists of Japanese heritage were banned from the state. Asawa didn’t
  regret her path, but she ended up on the artistically fertile margins because
  of her race, and she had to do it while segregated out of her home state.
