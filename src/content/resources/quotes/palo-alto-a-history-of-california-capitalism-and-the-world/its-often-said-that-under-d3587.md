  It’s often said that under capitalism, relations between people appear as
  relations between things. The butcher, baker, and candlestick maker vanish
  into the Bed Bath & Beyond. But there’s a countertendency at work within the
  ruling class, among whom relations between things often appear as relations
  between people.
