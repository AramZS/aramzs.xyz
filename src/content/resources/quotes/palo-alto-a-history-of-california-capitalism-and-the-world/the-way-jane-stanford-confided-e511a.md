  The way Jane Stanford confided in Goebel made her lack of faith obvious, and
  by 1905 she was ready to act. William James was coming to campus, and if the
  president didn’t like it, then maybe it was time for the school to find its
  second leader. But Jane Stanford never got to administer her final remedy. On
  February 28, 1905, she was poisoned to death.
