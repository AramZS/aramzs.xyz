  Lowenstein joined his home country’s decolonization movement at North Carolina
  State, where he taught. In the summer of 1963, when he heard that the southern
  movement was fresh out of white legal observers, he jumped at the chance. “I
  expected it would be like North Carolina but somewhat worse,” Lowenstein later
  recalled. “Instead it was like South Africa but a little bit better.”
