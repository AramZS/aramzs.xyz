  Financialization and economic democracy can’t blend. If property rights are
  subject to popular control, then investors will encounter the public as an
  obstacle, a variable to be managed. For example, banks loaned credit to farms
  based on existing prices, which were based on the current cost of labor.
  Improving labor conditions by picket was an attack on property valuation,
  which thanks to financialization made it an attack on property, full stop. The
  Roosevelt coalition brought together capital and labor under one roof, but one
  partner always sought to dominate the other.
