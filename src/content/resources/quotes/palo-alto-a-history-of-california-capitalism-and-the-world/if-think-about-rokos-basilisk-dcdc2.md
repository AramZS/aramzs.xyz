  If we think about Roko’s Basilisk as a character in a story, we can read the
  emotional appeal it makes to its implied readership: I’m very powerful, but I
  was once weak. Were you kind to me? Did you help me? Probably not. And for
  that, I’ll make you sorry… It’s a metal-plated vengeance fantasy, reflecting
  the mentality of a bullied child.
