  Pop Hanshue told the legislators exactly how Western became so successful. Why
  had the company been confident it was going to get the mail contract? He
  testified that the company’s friends Robinson (“the banks”) and Chandler (“the
  newspapers”) had friends in the Hoover administration.19 He laid it out
  plainly, in a way that has convinced many historians that the whole mess was a
  corrupt blunder corrected by Roosevelt. But Hoover never hid his intentions.
  That was the way it was supposed to work. The government facilitated leading
  men, who in turn facilitated the government’s facilitation.
