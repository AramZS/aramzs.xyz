  He earned the ire of staple-farmer populists, the loyalty of the processing
  industries, and the admiration of anyone who believed what was printed in the
  corporate press. America won the war, and the boys came home with an
  appreciation for canned food and candy. Rather than scale down mass production
  when soldiers went back to their local food systems, the processors plowed
  their wartime profits into advertising designed to convince the country that
  processed foods from national companies were better and safer.
