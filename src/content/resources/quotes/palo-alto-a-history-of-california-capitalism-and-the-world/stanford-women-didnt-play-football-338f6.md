  Stanford women didn’t play football, but they did play sports, and the
  administration encouraged it. The school was designed to be coed, and Terman
  was interested in girl geniuses as well as boy geniuses, finding plenty of
  subjects worth his time. Relative to other colleges, Stanford seems
  enlightened with regard to gender equality, but within the bionomic framework
  women were meant for something different from men. “[S]ince women exist in the
  main solely for the propagation of the species and are not destined for
  anything else,” Jordan declared in one of his evolution lectures, quoting the
  philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer, “they live, as a rule, more for the species
  than for the individual, and in their hearts take the affairs of the species
  more seriously than those of the individual.”
