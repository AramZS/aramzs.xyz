  Wartime Department of Defense administrators were used to writing blank checks
  for research and development, and now they were writing a lot of those checks
  to peacetime contractors like Stanford. That meant the government paid for new
  and expensive building-size research machines, including particle
  accelerators, nuclear reactors, and computers.
