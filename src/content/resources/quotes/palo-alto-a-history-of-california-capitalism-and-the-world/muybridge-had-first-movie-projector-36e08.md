  Muybridge had the first movie projector. He gave it the ungainly name
  zoopraxiscope, making him the world’s only zoopraxographer. In January of
  1880, he gave the first of his many zoopraxographic performances, at the
  Stanford mansion in San Francisco for Leland and a select group of friends.
  The age of movies began in California, not in Hollywood but in the Bay.
