  Larry and Sergey wrote that crawlers let loose on the world could cause
  “unpredictable or incorrect behavior,” then they (and others like them) let
  them loose anyway, disregarding many centuries of folk wisdom about sending
  armies of automata to do your bidding. Now these men are among the most
  powerful people in the world. That also happens in the fables.
