  Thiel has a healthy respect for the importance of small media outlets; Andrew
  Granato’s article in Stanford Politics—the most detailed examination of
  Thiel’s Stanford Review network—reports that he bragged at a reunion of the
  paper that he was funding the Journal of American Greatness and American
  Affairs, two relatively small publications that emerged to promote Trump-style
  nationalist conservatism.77 According to Thiel’s minion Charles Johnson, he is
  also funding Quillette, a conservative culture-war publication based out of
  Australia with an intellectual aesthetic.
