  Wage theft, stock fraud, and tax evasion are serious crimes, and they
  escalated dramatically in this period, but those are not the traditional
  referents for the 1990s “crime wave” discourse, because we have come to see
  ruling-class violations as part of a system that encourages cheating and
  corner cutting rather than as individual acts of social antagonism.
