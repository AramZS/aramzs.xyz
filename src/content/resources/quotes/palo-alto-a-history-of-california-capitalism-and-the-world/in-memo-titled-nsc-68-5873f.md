  In a memo titled “NSC 68,” the secretary of state, Dean Acheson, and the chief
  of Truman’s Policy Planning Staff, Paul Nitze, suggested a way to spend novel
  amounts of government money without appearing to crowd out private industry:
  rearmament. By paying for peacetime arsenals in America and western Europe
  (and “on behalf of” Japan), they could prepare for war with the communists as
  Shockley theorized it and boost global demand without driving down prices,
  kick-starting what we now think of as capitalism’s twentieth-century golden
  age.
