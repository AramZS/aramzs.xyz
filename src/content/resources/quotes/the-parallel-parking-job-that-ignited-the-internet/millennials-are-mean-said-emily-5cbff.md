  “Millennials are mean,” said Emily Gorcenski, a data scientist and activist.
  “We’re mean because we’ve been raised to live in a world that doesn’t exist,
  and it doesn’t exist because the people who raised us for that world ensured
  it doesn’t exist. And we process our anger through all sorts of channels, from
  sarcasm to pure hatred and rage.”
