  As SNCC field coordinator Charles E. Cobb Jr. writes in his book This
  Nonviolent Stuff’ll Get You Killed: How Guns Made the Civil Rights Movement
  Possible, even the most committed Christian pacifists (including MLK) were
  armed and ready to defend themselves from white marauders. Nonviolence for
  most of the activists, Cobb told me in an interview, was a tactical choice,
  and a limited one: on all the famous marches, people still flung rocks at the
  police. “Nonviolent” just meant they weren’t trying to start a war, though
  most Americans didn’t even believe them on that point.
