  The federal government only uses data on students who default within the first
  two years of repayment, but its numbers have the default rate increasing every
  year since 2005. Analyst accounts have only 40 percent of the total
  outstanding debt in active repayment, the majority being either in deferment
  or default. Next year, the Department of Education will calculate default
  rates based on numbers three years after the beginning of repayment rather
  than two. The projected results are staggering: recorded defaults for the
  class of 2008 will nearly double, from 7 to 13.8 percent.
