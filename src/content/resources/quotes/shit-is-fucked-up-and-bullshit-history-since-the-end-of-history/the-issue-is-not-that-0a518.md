  The issue is not that the people are too apathetic or too distracted by
  Netflix. Movements that might have grown big or militant enough to pose a
  threat to the order we’ve seen built since 9/11 have been repressed by the
  state, even when they only comprise Americans peacefully exercising their
  right—duty—to influence the path of their society. It does not seem to matter
  whether the activists in question are law-abiding or not.
