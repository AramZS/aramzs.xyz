  Like everyone who cares at all, I’ve struggled with the question of what the
  hell I’m supposed to be doing if I can’t stand the few continuing to ratchet
  up their exploitation of the many. It has been amazing as a leftist in America
  over the past decade to see so many people shift in that direction, and at the
  same time we have to know it’s in large part because things have gotten harder
  for more of them.
