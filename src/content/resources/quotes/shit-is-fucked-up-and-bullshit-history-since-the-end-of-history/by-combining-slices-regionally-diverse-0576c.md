  By combining slices of regionally diverse loans and theoretically spreading
  the risk of default, lenders were able to convince independent rating agencies
  that the resulting financial products were safe bets. They weren’t. But since
  this wouldn’t be America if you couldn’t monetize your children’s futures, the
  education sector still has its equivalent: the Student Loan Asset-Backed
  Security (or, as they’re known in the industry, SLABS).
