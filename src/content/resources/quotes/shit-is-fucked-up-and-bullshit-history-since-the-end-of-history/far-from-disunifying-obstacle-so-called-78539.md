  Far from a disunifying obstacle, so-called identity categories helped
  structure the lines of attack on J20. Our problem was not the existence of
  distinct black and Black blocs—they fought side-by-side against the cops and
  MAGA hats—our problem was a militarized police force dedicated to order
  regardless of the law. Since 9/11, all left-wing dissent has run smack into a
  homeland security apparatus that was built in significant part to repress us.
