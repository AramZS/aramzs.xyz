  Dale A. Smith’s words as they struck her at a Berlin conference about Vietnam:
  “Protest is when I say I don’t like this and that. Resistance is when I see to
  it that things that I don’t like no longer occur. Protest is when I say I will
  no longer go along with it. Resistance is when I see to it that no one else
  goes along with it anymore either.”
