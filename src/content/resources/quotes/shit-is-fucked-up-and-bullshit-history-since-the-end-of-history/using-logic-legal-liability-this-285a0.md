  Using the logic of legal liability, this narrative erases the whole category
  of action between permitted protest and insurrection. Either you obey the
  commands of the police and pack up your protest whenever they tell you to, or
  you might as well be murderers. That’s a narrow, legalistic division applied
  to a category of action (resistance) that is meant to be a check on the law
  itself.
