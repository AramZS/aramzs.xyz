  increasing college costs mean students need to take out more loans, more loans
  mean more securities lenders can package and sell, more selling means lenders
  can offer more loans with the capital they raise, which means colleges can
  continue to raise costs. The result is over $800 billion in outstanding
  student debt, over 30 percent of it securitized, and the federal government
  directly or indirectly on the hook for almost all of it.
