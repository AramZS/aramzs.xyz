  With full access to the average person’s data trail, you can know a lot: where
  they’ve been when, what they talk about and with whom, what they wear and eat,
  the pills they take, whom they love, whom they hate, where they’ll be, and so
  on. With that knowledge and all the computing power companies can buy, people
  are reduced to infinitely manipulatable input-output functions.
