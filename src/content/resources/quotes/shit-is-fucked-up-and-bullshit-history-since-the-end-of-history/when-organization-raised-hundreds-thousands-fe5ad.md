  When the organization raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for
  anti-fascists injured in the Charlottesville battle, they found themselves
  trapped mime-like inside the tax code’s tiny checkboxes, unable to disburse
  funds to the wounded. I’ve spoken with left-wing DSA members around the
  country who complain they spend much of their time and energy on internal
  conflicts with conservative elements in their chapters, particularly around
  the kind of legalism that tripped up the organization’s Charlottesville fund.
