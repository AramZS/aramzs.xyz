  But it wasn’t just Trump’s unpopularity in DC that kept the National Mall
  sparse, at least not the way you might think. The Left was ready, and for more
  than protest.1 Different formations organized to block the various entrances:
  a feminist bloc, a queer “Qockbloc,” a Movement for Black Lives bloc, a
  climate bloc, a labor bloc, and a classic antifa/anti-capitalist black bloc.
  It was like a social justice Avengers movie: everyone united, overlapped, and
  coordinated to fight in our common interest and defense. Organizers framed the
  day as a “festival of resistance,” and it worked. The inauguration was
  inaccessible for much of the day.
