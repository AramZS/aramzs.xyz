  It didn’t matter that Aaron, precocious until his suicide at twenty-six,
  worked within the law’s loopholes and never for personal gain; the prosecutors
  treated him not just like a criminal, but like an enemy. He was the kind of
  brilliant, harmless gadfly that liberal democracies are supposed to celebrate,
  and the state bullied him to death.4 I don’t expect better treatment than
  Aaron got, I don’t think any of us should.
