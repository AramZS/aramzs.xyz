  Search engines can use semantic analysis to identify the collection of web
  pages that focus on the topic of dog grooming. The search engines can then
  determine which of these sites about dog grooming have the most links from the
  set of dog grooming sites. These sites are most likely more authoritative on
  the topic than the others.
