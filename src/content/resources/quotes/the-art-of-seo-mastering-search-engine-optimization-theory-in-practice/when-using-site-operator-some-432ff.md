  When using the site: operator, some indexed URLs might not be displayed (even
  if you use the “repeat the search with omitted results included” link to see
  the full list). The site: query is notoriously inaccurate. You can obtain a
  more accurate count of the pages of your site indexed by Google by appending
  &start=990&filter=0 to the URL of a Google result set for a site: command.
