  Much of what bad managers do is assume their job is simply to find new things
  to jam and new places to jam them into, without ever believing they need to
  understand how the system—the system of people known as culture—works. Much
  like the frustrated moron who slaps the side of a TV when it stops working,
  taking action without understanding the system rarely helps.
