  Between 1994 and 2001, American teens doubled both their antidepressant and
  stimulant prescription rates.14 But these numbers don’t reflect an increased
  national willingness to deal with young people’s mental distress. Over this
  period, the percentage of teen visits to the psychiatrist resulting in the
  prescription of a psychotropic drug increased ten times as much as visits
  overall.
