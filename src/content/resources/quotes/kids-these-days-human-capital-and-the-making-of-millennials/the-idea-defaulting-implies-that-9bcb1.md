  The idea of defaulting implies that the debtor is unable to, and therefore
  does not, pay off the loan. But that’s not how it works. At the time of this
  writing, the latest numbers are for loans issued in Fiscal Year 2014: The
  government expects to make a staggering $140 billion in student loans,36 of
  which around 17.5 percent are projected to default at some point in the
  future.37
