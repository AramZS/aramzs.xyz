  When given the choice, employers would rather pay only for the labor-time they
  need, rather than assuming long-term commitments to flesh-and-blood workers
  who might get pregnant or fall down or get sick or need to grieve a family
  member or maybe just become redundant or too expensive. It’s much cheaper to
  think of labor as a flow that can be spliced into hourly pieces to fit
  employer specifications, a production input like plastic or electricity, and
  just as subject to rationalization.
