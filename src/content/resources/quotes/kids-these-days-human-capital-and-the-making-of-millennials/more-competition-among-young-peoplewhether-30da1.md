  More competition among young people—whether they want to be drummers, power
  forwards, scientists, or just not broke—means higher costs in the economic
  sense, but also in the area of mental health and social trust. If Americans
  are learning better and better to take whatever personal advantage we can get
  our hands on, then we’d be fools to trust each other. And as the stakes rise,
  we are also learning not to be fools.
