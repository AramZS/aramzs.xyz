  Like consumer politics, the electoral system isn’t actually built to enact the
  will of the people. That’s why people don’t feel like the government acts in
  their interests: It doesn’t. American politics is a professional realm, and
  most people aren’t invited to do much more than raise their hands every couple
  of years.
