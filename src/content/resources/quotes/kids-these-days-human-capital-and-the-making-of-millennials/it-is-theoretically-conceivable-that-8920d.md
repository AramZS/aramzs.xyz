  It is theoretically conceivable that everyone will get together and decide
  only to buy products from companies that pay high wages, halting or reversing
  many of the trends I’ve described so far. It’s also theoretically conceivable
  that, as you read this, a large meteor is headed our way and will strike the
  earth and obliterate all life before you get the chance to finish this
  conclusion. A reasonable observer should conclude that the latter is much more
  likely.
