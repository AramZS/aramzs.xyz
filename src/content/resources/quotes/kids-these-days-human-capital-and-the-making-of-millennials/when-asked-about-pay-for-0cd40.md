  When asked about pay for student-athletes before the 2014 Final Four
  championship, University of Connecticut star Shabazz Napier told the assembled
  media, “Sometimes, there’s hungry nights where I’m not able to eat, but I
  still gotta play up to my capabilities.… I don’t see myself so much as an
  employee, but when you see a jersey getting sold… you want something in
  return.
