  The average college student does not live on campus—only around 15 percent of
  undergraduates do. Most do not attend selective institutions that accept fewer
  than half of their applicants.4 Only 19 percent of full-time undergraduates in
  four-year public degree programs graduate on time, and it’s 5 percent for
  two-year programs.5 Students from poor families who go to college will
  probably remain working-class—38 percent of people from low-income families
  will remain in the bottom two deciles regardless of their educational
  accomplishment.
