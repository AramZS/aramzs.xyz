  However, they do not remotely reduce their housework hour-for-hour for time
  spent in paid labor. And while their male partners increase their own time in
  housework, this is not nearly as much as working wives reduce theirs. The
  upshot is that rather less unpaid household labor gets done overall in the
  dual-earner household—but women’s total combined time in paid and unpaid
  household labor is substantially greater than is the typical nonemployed
  women’s in domestic labor alone….The working woman is much busier than either
  her male colleague or her housewife counterpart.
