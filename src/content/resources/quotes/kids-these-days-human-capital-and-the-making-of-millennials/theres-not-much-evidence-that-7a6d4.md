  there’s not much evidence that unpaid internships lead to favorable job
  outcomes. A 2013 survey by the National Association of Colleges and Employers
  (NACE)—an organization that exists in part to promote internships—found that
  graduates who had completed an unpaid internship were less than 2 percent more
  likely to get a job offer than the control group (37 and 35.2 percent,
  respectively), and their median starting salary was actually lower ($35,721
  versus $37,087).
