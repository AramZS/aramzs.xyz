  To pursue the case, NCAA Division I football and basketball players had to be
  certified as a class, a barrier many commentators feared they wouldn’t be able
  to clear. Judge Wilken’s ruling sets the stage for further litigation,
  including the nightmare scenario: A Fair Labor Standards Act class action on
  behalf of even a small number of highly profitable former college athletes for
  back wages could lay waste to the concept of amateurism and push the NCAA into
  the historical abyss.
