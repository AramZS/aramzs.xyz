  Schools have found a lot of ways to improve their scores, demonstrating the
  kind of innovation that happens when the state puts a gun to your head.
  They’ve reduced arts and music time in favor of tested subjects like math and
  reading. Teachers spend instructional time telling kids how to fill out
  bubbles correctly and how to narrow choices to make a better guess.
