  In fact, nonsupervisory workers’ productivity increased rapidly between 1972
  and 2009, while real wages dipped.8 Until the 1970s, both metrics grew
  together; their disjuncture is perhaps the single phenomenon that defines
  Millennials thus far. Since young workers represent both a jump in
  productivity and a decrease in labor costs, this means we’re generating novel
  levels of “surplus value”—productivity beyond what workers receive in
  compensation.
