  Before the 1970s, the plurality of surveyed Americans said the ideal family
  had four or more children, but ever since, the dominant answer has been two
  kids. But even if that is what parents want, a perhaps unanticipated
  consequence has been more parental attention (and investment) concentrated on
  fewer children.
