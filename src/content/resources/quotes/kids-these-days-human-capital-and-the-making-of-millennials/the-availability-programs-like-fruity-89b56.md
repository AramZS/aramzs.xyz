  The availability of programs like Fruity Loops opened up a whole new medium
  for kids. “If you didn’t work in a major recording studio, you couldn’t just
  be a kid that liked making beats, it didn’t work like that,” Mikey Rocks of
  the hip-hop duo the Cool Kids told Fader magazine. “Then Fruity Loops came and
  the Internet started cracking where you could get shit for free. Once you
  could download it, it was like, Let’s go.”
