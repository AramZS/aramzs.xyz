  But Boomers are their own special group of Americans, with their own
  predilections. The Wall Street Journal broke down the numbers on accidental
  drug overdoses over time by age and didn’t find a consistent pattern: In the
  early 1970s, fifteen-to-twenty-four-year-olds overdosed most, then it was
  young and middle-aged adults, and now the forty-five-to-sixty-four-year-olds
  have taken over.49 It didn’t make much sense, until they looked at how the
  Boomer cohort traveled through those numbers.
