  Higher education is, in addition to other things, an economic regime that
  extracts increasingly absurd amounts of money from millions of young people’s
  as-yet-unperformed labor. For anyone who takes out a student loan—and that’s
  two-thirds of students—succeeding at contemporary American childhood now means
  contracting out hours, days, years of their future work to the government,
  with no way to escape the consequences of what is barely a decision in the
  first place.
