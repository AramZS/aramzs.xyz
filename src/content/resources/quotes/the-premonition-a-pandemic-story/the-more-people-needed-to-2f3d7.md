  the more people needed to be infected before the herd was theoretically safe.
  Measles’ reproductive rate of 18, on the high end, implies that ninety-five
  percent of the population needs to be immune to measles before measles stops
  spreading. That’s why we have as our goal to vaccinate 95 percent of the
  population against measles. Before COVID-19 stopped spreading, two-thirds of
  Californians would need to become infected.
