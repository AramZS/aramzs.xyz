  The breaking point for Foege came in 1983, after the CDC’s researchers
  established a connection between aspirin and Reye’s syndrome in children. When
  given to children suffering from flu or measles, aspirin could trigger
  swelling in the liver and the brain and, in rare cases, death. Companies that
  manufactured aspirin petitioned the White House. “The White House called and
  told us to cease and desist,” recalled Foege. “Do a new study.” The aspirin
  makers had been able to force the CDC to scrap its findings and slow down
  science. Foege had resigned after that.
