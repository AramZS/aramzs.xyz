  In this new story she told herself about herself, she was never simply a
  victim. For whatever had happened she bore some responsibility. Whether she
  did, or did not, was beside the point: the new story had the very practical
  effect of shifting the focus from others onto herself, and from things she
  could not control to things that she could. In this story, she was put on
  earth for some purpose, and it was her job not just to figure out what that
  purpose might be but to make sure she did not allow herself to become
  distracted from its fulfillment.
