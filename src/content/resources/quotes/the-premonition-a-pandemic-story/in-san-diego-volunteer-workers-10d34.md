  In San Diego, volunteer workers had been picking migrants off the streets
  where United States immigration officers had dumped them and bringing them to
  Our Lady of Guadalupe Church, which had offered shelter. Inside the church,
  Charity found hundreds of tired, scared, and obviously unhealthy refugees.
  Each night, the church volunteers told her, she should expect between
  twenty-five and one hundred twenty-five new arrivals. “It felt like chaos,”
  said Charity. “The hallways are lined with families sitting on the floor.
  These are like mothers and babies, who, by the way, have been kept in cages.”
