  The San Quentin officials sent in one batch of samples, in April, but asked
  the Biohub to keep mum about it because they were worried that the private
  testing company that serviced California prisons would be upset. If Quest
  finds out, they are going to kill our contract, they’d said. That first batch
  contained no positives for COVID-19, but San Quentin sent no further samples.
  Later they explained that they didn’t have the time to do the paperwork.
