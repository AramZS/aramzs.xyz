  One intervention was not like the others, however: when you closed schools and
  put social distance between kids, the flu-like disease fell off a cliff. (The
  model defined “social distance” not as zero contact but as a 60 percent
  reduction in kids’ social interaction.) “I said, ‘Holy shit!’ ” said Carter.
  “Nothing big happens until you close the schools. It’s not like anything else.
  It’s like a phase change. It’s nonlinear. It’s like when water temperature
  goes from thirty-three to thirty-two. When it goes from thirty-four to
  thirty-three, it’s no big deal; one degree colder and it turns to ice.”
