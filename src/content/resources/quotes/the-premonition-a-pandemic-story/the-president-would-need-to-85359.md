  The president would need to issue an executive order to make an exception for
  medical privacy laws, but that seemed a small price to pay for a million
  American lives. Highly specific personal data would leave no room for people
  in any neighborhood to retreat into a private reality in which they could
  imagine that the virus either didn’t exist or was overblown.
