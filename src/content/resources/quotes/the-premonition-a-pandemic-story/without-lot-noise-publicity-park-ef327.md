  Without a lot of noise or publicity, Park had created three different
  billion-dollar health care technology companies, and then gone on to serve for
  three years under President Obama as the country’s chief technology officer.
  He had a reputation for fixing other people’s messes without drawing attention
  to himself, and so had made himself popular with public figures without ever
  really becoming one himself.
