  United States government had been drifting that way for some time—management
  jobs once done by career civil servants being turned into roles performed by
  people appointed by the president. One of the problems this created was
  management inexperience: the average tenure of the appointees fluctuated
  between eighteen months and two years, depending on the administration.
  Another was the kind of person the job now selected for. There would be
  exceptions, of course, but the odds favored the pleaser.
