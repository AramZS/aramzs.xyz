  It was not possible for a vaccine maker, or a society, to adapt to an evolving
  virus without genomic information. And yet nearly a year into the pandemic, in
  February 2021, the number of genomes being sequenced in the United States was
  trivial—less than a third of 1 percent of the virus in people who tested
  positive. (The UK was by then sequencing 10 percent of its positives; Denmark
  had set a goal of sequencing all of them.) The United States was sequencing
  fewer of its genomes than any other industrialized country, and the only
  reason it was sequencing as many as it was is that a bunch of nonprofits had
  stepped in to do it, haphazardly, for free.
