  The next day, Richard wrote to Carter with a question. As the head of CEPI,
  Richard had the power to direct hundreds of millions of dollars to companies
  with new ideas about how to make vaccines more quickly than they had ever been
  made. It was interesting to note, and Richard noted it, that the free market
  had no interest in funding these companies in their early stages.
