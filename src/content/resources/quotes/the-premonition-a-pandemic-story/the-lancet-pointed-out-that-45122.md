  The Lancet pointed out that if the COVID death rate in the United States had
  simply tracked the average of the other six G7 nations, 180,000 of those
  people would still be alive. “Missing Americans,” they called them. But why
  stop there? Before the pandemic, a panel of public-health experts had judged
  the United States to be more prepared for a pandemic than other G7 nations. In
  a war with a virus, we were not expected merely to fare as well as other rich
  countries. We were expected to win.
