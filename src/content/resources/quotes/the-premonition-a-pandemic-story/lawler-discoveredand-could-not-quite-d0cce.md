  Lawler discovered—and could not quite believe—that the CDC didn’t plan to test
  any of the new arrivals unless they had a fever. All of the foreigners being
  shipped home from Wuhan were being tested before they got on the plane, and
  the CDC felt that was adequate. The Germans and the Australians and the
  Japanese had tested all of their citizens after they’d flown home from Wuhan
  and discovered that 1 to 2 percent of them were infected, and that many of
  those had no symptoms: the tests in Wuhan hadn’t identified any of them.
