  Once she’d become a public-health officer, she’d imagined an entire career in
  public service. Now she did not believe that the American government, at this
  moment in its history, would ever do what needed doing. Disease prevention was
  a public good, but the public wasn’t going to provide anything like enough of
  it. From the point of view of American culture, the trouble with disease
  prevention was that there was no money in it. She needed to find a way to make
  it pay.
