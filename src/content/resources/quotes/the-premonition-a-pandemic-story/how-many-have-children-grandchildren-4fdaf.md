  How many of you have children or grandchildren? asked Marty. Nearly all hands
  went up. If there’s a pandemic anything like the one in 1918, how many would
  send your kids to school? One guy from someplace in Florida raised his hand,
  then saw that he was alone and quickly lowered it. “So it’s only poor kids who
  need school lunch who should risk illness and death to go to school,” Carter
  said. “Why don’t we just find another way to feed them so they can stay home,
  too?”
