  The airport was transformed. There were now lots of security people wearing
  masks. Passengers were required to step, one by one, inside an acrylic stall
  and be scanned for fever. “They weren’t fooling around,” said Joe. “I thought,
  What the hell is going on?” He’d never seen a fever box and, as he stepped
  inside, he had a feeling in the pit of his stomach. “I thought, These people
  know something we don’t.”
