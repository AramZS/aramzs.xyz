  In just five weeks in the fall of 1918, twelve thousand people died. Corpses
  were stacked like cordwood outside the city morgue; corpses rotted in the
  streets. Philadelphians closed schools and banned public gatherings and wore
  masks—and suffered the highest death rate in the country. That’s why everyone
  now thought that social distancing was a waste of time. But what struck Carter
  now was how slow Philadelphia’s leaders had been to respond, even after they
  knew a deadly virus was racing out of control in their city. Yet he also saw
  that other cities had had radically different outcomes.
