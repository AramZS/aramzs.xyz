  Santa Barbara County was both bigger and more complicated than it seemed. It
  had the highest rate of child poverty in the state. It sheltered maybe fifty
  thousand illegal immigrants in abject squalor. Plus all hell could break loose
  at any time: wildfires and mudslides and oil spills and mass shootings.
  Scratch the surface of paradise and you were plunged into the Book of Job.
