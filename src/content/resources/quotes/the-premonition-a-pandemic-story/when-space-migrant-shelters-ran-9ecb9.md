  When space in the migrant shelters ran out, ICE workers would drive these
  people into cities in the dead of night and just leave them there. “I’d heard
  that Trump was trying to create a crisis,” said Charity. “Trying to turn
  people against immigrants. It was just a rumor. But when I get there I find
  this is all true. They’re just dumping families on street corners at two in
  the morning. They were trying to create a disaster.”
