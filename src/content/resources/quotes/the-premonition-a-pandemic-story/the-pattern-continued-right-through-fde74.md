  The pattern continued right through the pandemic: the Trump administration
  would claim with fanfare that supplies were on their way to the states and
  leave it to the career civil servants whose job was to interact with state
  officials to reap the humiliation when those supplies failed to arrive. It
  would happen again with ventilators, with the drug Remdesivir, and, finally,
  with vaccines. Among other consequences of the White House’s strategy was that
  it gutted the credibility of the career federal officials.
