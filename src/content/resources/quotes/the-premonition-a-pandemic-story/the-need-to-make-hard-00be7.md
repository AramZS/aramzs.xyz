  the need to make hard decisions in public health didn’t just go away. It got
  pushed down in the system, onto local health officers. They had little social
  status and were thus highly vulnerable, but they also had little choice, if
  they hoped to save lives. Local health officers across the country paid with
  their jobs and more in their attempts to control a disease without the help of
  the Centers for Disease Control.
