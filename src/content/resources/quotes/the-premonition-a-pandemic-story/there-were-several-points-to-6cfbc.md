  There were several points to this story. One was how screwed up the incentives
  were inside the medical-industrial complex. It was possible to spend
  $1,000,100 on drugs to prevent you from dying without anyone’s having any idea
  if any of them would work; at the same time, inside of a few weeks but too
  late to save you, some ill-paid postdoc was able to find a cheap cure. Another
  was that even when you might have thought that problem was solved, it wasn’t.
  Two years after Joe and his postdocs published their findings on Balamuthia,
  the FDA had yet to approve Nitroxoline, long since cleared by European
  regulators, as a treatment. The CDC website continued to recommend an old
  treatment (another one of the 2,177 drugs) that the DeRisi Lab had
  demonstrated did nothing but create unpleasant side effects.
