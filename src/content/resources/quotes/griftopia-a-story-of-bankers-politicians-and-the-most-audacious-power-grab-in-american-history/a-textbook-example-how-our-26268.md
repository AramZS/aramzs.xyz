  a textbook example of how our national electoral politics and our media
  watchdogs are inadequate to address even the most glaring emergencies. When
  you have a system with an electorate divided up into two fiercely warring
  tribes, each determined to blame the country’s problems on the other, it will
  often be next to impossible to get anyone to even pay attention to a problem
  that is not the fault of one or the other group. Moreover it is incredibly
  easy to shift blame for the problem to one of those groups, or to both of
  them, if you know how to play things right—which happened over and over again
  in this case.
