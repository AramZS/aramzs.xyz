  Say you have the BBB tranche from that first deal Andy did. You lump it in
  with the BBB tranches from five, six, seven other deals. Then you just repeat
  the same tiering process that you started with, and you say, “Well, the first
  hundred thousand dollars of the revenue from all these BBB tiers that goes
  into the box every month, that goes to the AAA investors in this new CDO.”
