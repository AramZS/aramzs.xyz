  In bubble economics, actual human beings have only a few legitimate roles:
  they’re either customers of the financial services industry (borrowers,
  investors, or depositors) or else they’re wage earners whose taxes are used to
  provide both implicit and explicit investment insurance for the big
  casino-banks pushing the bubble scam.
