  A 2003 New England Journal of Medicine study found that administrative costs
  make up a full 31 percent of all health care spending in the United States.
  That’s compared to 16.7 percent in Canada. Moreover, the administrative costs
  in the United States are not only growing but skyrocketing: they were $450 per
  capita in 1991, but were up to $1,059 per capita in 2003. All that extra money
  is going to the one part of this whole deal that adds nothing to patient care:
  clerks fighting over claims.
