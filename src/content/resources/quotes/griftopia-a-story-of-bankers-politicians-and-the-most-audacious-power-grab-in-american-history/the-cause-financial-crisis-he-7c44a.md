  “The cause of the financial crisis,” he says, “was quite simply the commitment
  by the United States government to bring home ownership to the next group of
  people who previously had not been able to own their own homes.” There it is.

  financial institutions borrowing vast fuckloads of money and gambling it all
  away, knowing that the government would have to swoop in and rescue them if
  they failed. No, what sank the economy was poor black people who were pushed
  into buying houses they couldn’t afford by the government.
