  There probably isn’t a better example of how the Democratic Party thinks, or
  nonthinks as it were, than this. Instead of repealing a grossly
  anticompetitive law that was passed basically by mistake sixty years ago, the
  party decided to try to ensure private competition in the health insurance
  industry by creating a state-run insurance plan. “They basically didn’t want
  to pick another fight,” says Martin.
