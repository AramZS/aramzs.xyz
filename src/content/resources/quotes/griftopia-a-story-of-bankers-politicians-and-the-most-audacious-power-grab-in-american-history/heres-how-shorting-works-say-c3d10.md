  Here’s how shorting works. Say you’re a hedge fund and you think the stock of
  a certain company—let’s call it International Pimple—is going to decline in
  value. How do you make money off that knowledge? First, you call up a
  securities lender, someone like, say, Win Neuger, and ask if he has any stock
  in International Pimple. He says he does, as much as you want. You then borrow
  a thousand shares of International Pimple from Neuger, which let’s say is
  trading at 10 that day. So that’s $10,000 worth of stock. Now, in order to
  “borrow” those shares from Neuger, you have to give him collateral for those
  shares in the form of cash. For his trouble, you have to pay him a slight
  markup, usually 1–2 percent of the real value. So perhaps instead of sending
  $10,000 to Neuger, you send him $10,200. Now you take those thousand shares of
  International Pimple, you go out onto the market, and you sell them. Now
  you’ve got $10,000 in cash again. Then, you wait for the stock to decline in
  value. So let’s say a month later, International Pimple is now trading not at
  10 but at 7½. You then go out and buy a thousand shares in the company for
  $7,500. Then you go back to Win Neuger and return his borrowed shares to him;
  he returns your $10,000 and takes the stock back. You’ve now made $2,500 on
  the decline in value of International Pimple, less the $200 fee that Neuger
  keeps. That’s how short selling works,
