  If enough of Neuger’s securities-lending clients demanded their money back at
  once, suddenly there was a real threat that the parent company AIG would have
  to reach down and liquidate the assets of these mom-and-pop insurance
  companies, leaving those tens of thousands of people out in the wilderness.
  All in order to cover Neuger’s colossally stupid and unnecessary bets on the
  mortgage market.
