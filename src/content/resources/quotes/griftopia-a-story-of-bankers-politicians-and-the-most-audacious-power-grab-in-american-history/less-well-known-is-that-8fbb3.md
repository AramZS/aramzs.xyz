  Less well known is that the counterparties to Neuger’s securities-lending
  operations would receive a staggering $43.7 billion in public money via the
  AIG bailout, with Goldman getting the second-biggest slice, at $4.8 billion
  (Deutsche Bank, with $7 billion, was number one). How they accomplished that
  feat was somewhat complicated. First, the Fed put up the money to cover the
  collateral calls against Neuger from Goldman and other banks. Then the Fed set
  up a special bailout facility called Maiden Lane II (named after the tiny
  street in downtown Manhattan next to the New York Federal Reserve Bank), which
  it then used to systematically buy up all the horseshit RMBS assets Neuger and
  his moronic “ten cubed”–chasing employees had bought up with all their
  billions in collateral over the years.
