  Instead of talking about what to do about the fact that, after all the mergers
  in the crisis, just four banks now account for half of the country’s mortgages
  and two-thirds of its credit card accounts, we’ll be debating whether or not
  we should still automatically grant citizenship to the American-born children
  of illegal immigrants, or should let Arizona institute a pass-law regime, or
  some such thing.
