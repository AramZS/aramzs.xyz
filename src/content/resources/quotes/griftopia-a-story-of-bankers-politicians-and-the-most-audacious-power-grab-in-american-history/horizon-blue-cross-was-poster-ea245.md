  Horizon Blue Cross was the poster child for local health insurance cartels—it
  dominated the state of New Jersey, operating like a Mafia gang that insisted
  on its protection money, and it was a dangerous thing for any hospital to buck
  its power. In this case, Bayonne’s decision to drop out of the network
  inspired a serious reprisal: the insurer drowned Bayonne in paper and denials.
  It denied repayment in one case involving a patient who had come in to the
  hospital and received IV antibiotics; the grounds were that the patient had
  been a nurse twenty years earlier and should have been able to administer that
  care herself, in her own home. “I guess if your father’s a surgeon and your
  mother’s an anesthesiologist, lie down on the kitchen table and get your heart
  fixed there,” Kane quipped.
