  The Bayonne doctors in New Jersey—a state that had seen ten hospitals close
  since 2007, and another six file for bankruptcy, a little slice of the
  national hospital network that might easily be described as the front lines of
  the death of American health care—pointed this little issue out to the
  insurer, Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield. No soap. “We explained it, said, you
  know, we would have killed the guy if we’d operated. But their physician’s
  assistant upheld the denial,” Eileen Popola, the hospital’s case manager later
  explained.
