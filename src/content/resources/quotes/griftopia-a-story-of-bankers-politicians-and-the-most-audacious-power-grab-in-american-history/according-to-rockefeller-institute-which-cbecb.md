  According to the Rockefeller Institute, which tracks state revenue collection,
  the rate of growth for state taxes hit its lowest point in five years in the
  first quarter of 2008, which is when oil began its surge from around $75 to
  $149 a barrel. In the second quarter the institute reported continued
  slowdowns, and in the third quarter, the quarter in which oil reached that
  high of $149, overall tax growth was more or less flat, at 0.1 percent, the
  lowest rate since the bursting of the tech bubble in 2001–2. Obviously the
  collapse of the housing market around that time was a major factor in all of
  this, but surging energy prices impacting the entire economy—forcing business
  and consumer spending alike to retract—also had to be crucial.
