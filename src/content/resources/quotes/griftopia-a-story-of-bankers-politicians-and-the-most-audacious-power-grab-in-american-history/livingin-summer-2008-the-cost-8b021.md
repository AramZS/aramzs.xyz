  living—in the summer of 2008, the cost of energy almost certainly hit you
  hard. There was no serious attempt by either the national media or the
  national political establishment to explain the cause of the problem. Most
  people assumed it had to do with some combination of shortages and/or
  increased demand from the Chinese industrial machine, and most TV reports were
  more than willing to encourage that perception, despite the fact that there
  were no long lines at the gas stations, no seventies-style rage-fests while
  waiting for gas, no obvious evidence of scarcity.
