  The epic struggle to pass health care reform was at once a shameless betrayal
  of the public trust of historic proportions and proof that a nation that
  perceives itself as being divided into red and blue should start paying
  attention to a third color that rules the day in Washington—a sort of
  puke-colored politics that puts together deals like this one and succeeds
  largely through its mastery of the capital city’s bureaucracy.
