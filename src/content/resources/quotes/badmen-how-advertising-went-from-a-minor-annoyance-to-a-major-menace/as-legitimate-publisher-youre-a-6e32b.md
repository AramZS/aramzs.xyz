  As a legitimate publisher you’re in a double bind. You want to move
  advertisers from the “generic eyeball” market to quality sites where site
  reputation, not sneaky tracking, is the critical advantage. At the same time
  you have to play the existing game where you can’t sell an ad unless you agree
  to infest your site with trackers that are data-leaking your user data to the
  junk sites you’re competing with.
