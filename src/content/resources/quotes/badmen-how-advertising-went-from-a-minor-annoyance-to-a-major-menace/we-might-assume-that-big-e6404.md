  We might assume that the big gainers from online ad fraud are the criminals
  themselves. But according to the WFA, the group that gains the most is
  actually the legitimate marketing and advertising industry. The more skin an
  ad agency or agency holding company has in the ad tech money-flow chain (e.g.,
  agency of record; trading desk; DSP; ad tech provider, etc) the greater is its
  potential for revenue derived indirectly from ad fraud. In fact, as far as
  agencies and other marketing entities are concerned, fraud seems to add to
  their revenue stream.
