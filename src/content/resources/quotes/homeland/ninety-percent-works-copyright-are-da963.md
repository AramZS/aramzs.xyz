  Ninety percent of the works in copyright are orphan works: no one knows who
  owns the rights to them, and no one can figure out how to put them back into
  print. Meanwhile, the copies of them that we do know about are disintegrating
  or getting lost. So there’s a library out there, the biggest library ever,
  ninety percent of the stuff anyone’s ever created, and it’s burning, in slow
  motion.
