  The event was a tradition for all departing secretaries. They wanted a line of
  Pentagon personnel that stretched for a mile applauding Mattis as he left the
  Pentagon for the last time as secretary. It was going to be “yuge,” staffers
  joked, borrowing from Trump’s glossary. But Mattis would not allow it. “No, we
  are not doing that,” he told his aides. “You don’t understand the president. I
  work with him. You don’t know him like I do. He will take it out on Shanahan
  and Dunford.”
