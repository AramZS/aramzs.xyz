  Addressing the room, the commander in chief barked, “You’re a bunch of dopes
  and babies.” For a president known for verbiage he euphemistically called
  “locker room talk,” this was the gravest insult he could have delivered to
  these people, in this sacred space. The flag officers in the room were
  shocked. Some staff began looking down at their papers, rearranging folders,
  almost wishing themselves out of the room. A few considered walking out. They
  tried not to reveal their revulsion on their faces, but questions raced
  through their minds. “How does the commander in chief say that?” one thought.
  “What would our worst adversaries think if they knew he said this?”
