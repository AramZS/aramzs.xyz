  When Alexander Hamilton wrote the two essays in The Federalist devoted to the
  idea of impeachment, Trump was the kind of president he had in mind—a populist
  demagogue who would foment frenzy, pander to prejudices, feed off chaos, and
  secretly betray the American people in the accumulation of power—according to
  Hamilton’s biographer Ron Chernow. Two hundred thirty-two years after Hamilton
  put pen to paper, Trump’s pressure campaign on Ukraine forced a reckoning.
  Would the system the Founding Fathers imagined withstand the pressures of this
  moment? Or would Trump prevail yet again, another pursuit of justice stymied
  by his sheer political force and the fealty of his followers?
