  In March, McMaster was in the Oval Office briefing Trump on the visit of the
  German chancellor, Angela Merkel, a favorite foil for the president. Trump got
  so impatient that he stood up and walked into an adjoining bathroom, left the
  door ajar, and instructed McMaster to raise his voice and keep talking. It was
  unclear if the strange scene was a reflection of Trump’s feelings about
  McMaster or Merkel or both.
