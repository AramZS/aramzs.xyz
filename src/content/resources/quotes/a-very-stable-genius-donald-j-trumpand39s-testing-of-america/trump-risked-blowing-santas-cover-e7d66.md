  Trump risked blowing Santa’s cover when he was patched through to a
  seven-year-old girl, Collman Lloyd, calling from her home in South Carolina.
  “Are you still a believer in Santa?” Trump asked. “Yes, sir,” Lloyd replied.
  “Because at 7, that’s marginal, right?” the president said. Lloyd later told
  The Post and Courier that she had never heard the word “marginal” before.
