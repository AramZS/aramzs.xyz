  Marines revered Mattis, and the guard was no exception. The general had earned
  his reputation the slow and steady way. A bachelor who never married, the
  commander made it a tradition that he would volunteer to take a junior
  officer’s shift on Christmas Day so his subordinates could spend the holiday
  with their families.
