  As the group discussed a possible bipartisan immigration deal that would
  protect migrants from Haiti, El Salvador, and African countries, Trump grew
  frustrated. “Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come
  here?” the president asked. He specifically denigrated Haiti, an impoverished
  Caribbean nation made up mostly of descendants of African slaves, and said the
  United States should instead allow migrants from Norway, a Nordic country that
  is one of the world’s whitest and wealthiest, and other countries.
