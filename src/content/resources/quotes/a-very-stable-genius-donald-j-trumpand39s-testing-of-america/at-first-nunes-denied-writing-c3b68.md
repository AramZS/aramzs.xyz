  At first, Nunes denied writing any letter to the White House with sensitive
  intelligence. Then one of Rosenstein’s deputies showed him the letter with his
  signature. Nunes said nothing. The Justice Department team members found that
  puzzling. They wondered if Nunes’s staff had written it and not told him. For
  a short portion of the meeting, the conversation turned testy.
