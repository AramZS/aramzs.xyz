  Modi tried to keep the conversation on an elevated plane, hoping to follow the
  path Tillerson had laid out for them in the previous weeks to work together to
  protect India and fend off China’s Belt and Road Initiative. But each time
  Modi tried to get Trump to engage on the substance of U.S.-India relations,
  the American president veered off on another non sequitur about trade deficits
  and the endless war in Afghanistan.
