  By 1992, I felt the need to begin my transition. So, I contacted a therapist
  who had helped some of my friends begin. After a few visits, she gave me an
  extensive test of over 500 questions called an MMPI, which stands for the
  Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory. The creators of this test
  designed it to give a therapist a fairly accurate breakdown of a person’s
  personality. If questions are answered truthfully, it can tell a lot about a
  person, including their gender identity. However, the questions on the test
  relating to gender identity are so blatantly obvious that a person could
  easily manipulate their answers to show the identity they want the therapist
  to see. I have heard of that happening, so I don’t personally hold much stock
  in the test’s validity in that area.
