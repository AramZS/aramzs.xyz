  term has become a phrase to scare employees into thinking they have no right
  to complain if they get fired in a right-to-work state. In reality it means
  that if a shop or facility has a union in it, employees don’t have to join the
  union to work there, yet they nevertheless still receive all the benefits the
  union has to offer. In a non-right-to-work state, a person has to join the
  union in order to work at a shop or facility that has a union present.
