  Transgenderism is about identity, rather than sexual orientation. A trans
  person doesn’t change gender in order to better sleep with the sex they are
  attracted to, instead they transition because their body doesn’t match their
  true gender. Moreover, the gender a trans person is attracted to doesn’t
  normally change because of their transition.
