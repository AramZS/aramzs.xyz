  The design I’d subconsciously come up with had five equal-sized stripes going
  horizontally across the flag. The top and bottom stripes would be light blue,
  the traditional color for baby boys. The two stripes inside of the blue
  stripes were pink, the traditional color for baby girls. The center stripe
  would be white for those either in transition, those who have a neutral or
  undefined gender, or those who identify as bigender or agender.
