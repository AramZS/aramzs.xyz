  I decided not to reproduce the directive here in my book because it is too
  long. I also understand that the Trump Administration is doing its best to
  destroy it and send healthcare for trans veterans back to the Stone Age. It is
  my fervent hope that responsible and patriotic people will stop this from
  happening. Trans veterans deserve better.
