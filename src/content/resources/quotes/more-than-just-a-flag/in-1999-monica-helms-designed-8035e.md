  In 1999, Monica Helms designed the transgender flag, the original of which now
  resides at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. She is best known
  for that, but she did much more than create a flag. She served honorably as a
  submariner in the U.S. Navy, married and fathered two sons, had a career as a
  telephone operator, and is now married for a second time.
