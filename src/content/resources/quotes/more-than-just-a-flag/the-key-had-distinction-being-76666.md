  The Key had the distinction of being one of the Navy’s top-of-the-line, 1970s
  high-tech, Fleet Ballistic Missile (FBM) submarines, also called Boomers. The
  term Boomer comes from the tremendous explosive power carried by FBM
  submarines, with their 16 multi-warhead missiles. When fully loaded and ready
  for sea, she carried more destructive power than all the explosives released
  in World War II combined.
