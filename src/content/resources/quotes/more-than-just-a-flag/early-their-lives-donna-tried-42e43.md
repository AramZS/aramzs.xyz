  Early in their lives, Donna and I tried to convey the complex concept of love
  to our boys in a way they would understand. Telling a three-year-old you love
  them can be confusing, even when you follow that with a hug. Instead we said,
  “I want you and I’m so happy you are in my life.” In my opinion this statement
  conveys to the child that they are wanted and needed. This meant that when
  they were older, they truly understood the strength and meaning of the word
  love.
