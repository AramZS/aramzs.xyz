  I placed the hood over my head, stepped into the water from the escape trunk
  and swam to the top hollering “Ho, ho, ho” all the way up. The design of the
  hood allowed the expanding air in the vest to blow into the hood so the wearer
  could breathe. To ensure that the person rising from the trunk released
  depressurizing air from their lungs, they had to say “Ho, ho, ho.” If anyone
  didn’t do so, divers stationed at various levels would stop the person and
  make them release air from their lungs.
