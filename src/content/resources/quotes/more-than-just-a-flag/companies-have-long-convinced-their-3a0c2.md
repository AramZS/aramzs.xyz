  Companies have long convinced their employees that they can fire any one of
  them for any reason if they are in a right-to-work state. They fail to tell
  you that a person can also be fired for any reason in a non-right-to-work
  state as well. Just ask any trans person fired in states like New York,
  California or Massachusetts, or any of the other 25 non-right-to-work states.
  A union in any state can provide you with a bit more protection than you would
  otherwise have without one. And, as far as gender identity and gender
  expression goes, more and more unions are adding provisions to their contracts
  to protect trans workers. The AFL-CIO now has a strong constituency group
  called Pride at Work, which can help in this area. They can be found on the
  Internet at www.prideatwork.org.
