  Michelle would lie and cheat to get the hormones, or anything else, she
  wanted. One time, I even caught her stealing hormones from me. She felt like
  the whole world owed her a living for being a trans woman. Cindy, on the other
  hand, believed that a person changing from male-to-female isn’t really a
  transsexual unless they have surgery. She held on to the notion that unless
  you “go stealth” and blend in, you’re not a true transsexual. I hate that term
  and find this attitude nearly as repulsive as Michelle’s.
