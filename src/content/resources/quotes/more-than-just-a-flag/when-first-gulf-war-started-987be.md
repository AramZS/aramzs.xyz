  When the first Gulf War started, they called Wendy to Strategic Air Command
  Headquarters because of her knowledge of Middle East targets. After she
  arrived, the Commander looked at her then said, “Welcome back Lt Cdr Keiser. I
  see you’ve changed a little since we last saw you. Please make sure you get a
  new photo on your security badge.” Wendy did so well during that war that she
  received a promotion to Commander.
