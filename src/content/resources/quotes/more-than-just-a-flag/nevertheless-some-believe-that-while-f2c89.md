  Nevertheless, some believe that, while trans activists say they want equality
  for all trans people, in reality they are only working to advance the rights
  of trans people who have surgery. Some famous trans women think that in order
  to be considered a ‘true transsexual’ you have to get SRS. This is wrong. To
  these ‘purists’ the pain in starting transition, losing family, friends,
  places of worship and jobs means nothing, in spite of the fact that,
  unfortunately, these days such experiences go hand in hand with
  transgenderism. The idea that you have to have a vagina or you aren’t
  committed to being a woman is, in my humble opinion, ridiculous.
