  Tucker Carlson showed himself to be an ass once again when he commented on us
  being at the convention, calling us names. He even tried to make light of us
  being there by having Jerry Springer on his show, but Springer, a Democrat,
  shut Tucker down by pointing out that the Republicans were nothing more than a
  party of rich, white men and the Democrats had true diversity.
