  name was Alexander Goodrum, a local activist. I later discovered that
  Alexander’s involvement in the LGBT community in Tucson resulted in the city’s
  new non-discrimination policy having gender-identity-specific language written
  into it. This unassuming man had done so much for trans people in the state of
  Arizona. I found myself really admiring him.
