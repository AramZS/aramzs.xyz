  In a year when the religious-right vilified LGBT people more often than they
  changed their underwear, the Democratic Party wanted to play it safe and
  pander to the Republicans’ hate-mongering. This meant down-playing their
  support of sexual orientation and ignoring trans issues altogether. In the
  interest of party unity, but not in the interest of trans people, the Platform
  Committee told us that if we pushed our amendment, they wouldn’t pass it and
  we would lose any access to the DNC’s leaders.
