  The idea that a “full name” can constitute a dox represents an understanding
  that in some contexts, the publication of a legal name serves as an incitement
  to drop a full dox. Through Google and other databases, a full name can lead
  to other details—a revealing social media account, pictures of one’s children,
  a work address, even a home address. Information like addresses, phone
  numbers, and place of work has been publicly available for a long time. But as
  sociologist and writer Katherine Cross points out, “the unique
  force-multiplying effects of the Internet are underestimated. There’s a
  difference between info buried in small font in a dense book of which only a
  few thousand copies exist in a relatively small geographic location versus
  blasting this data out online where anyone with a net connection anywhere in
  the world can access it.” The context in which the publicly information gets
  posted matters.
