  social networks are a natural monopoly. Individual users stay even if they
  don’t like the platform or the user interface, because it’s where the
  conversation is happening. A social media platform is like the only mall or
  the only church in a small town. You might not like the mall, and you might
  not be a Christian, but you have to go meet with your neighbors somewhere.
