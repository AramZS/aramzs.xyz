  “Traveling around Tunisia, I kept being introduced to bloggers … [but] it
  turns out very few of them were actually blogging. … Instead, the ‘bloggers’
  were people who were active on Facebook. … People are on Facebook not because
  they prefer it for any ideological reason, but because it offers the ability
  to reach the right people, with minimal effort, and maximum replicability.”
