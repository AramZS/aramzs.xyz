  Large-scale sustained campaigns also resemble tiny, crude, handmade botnets.
  At the center is an orchestrator, who perhaps engages in harassment from
  multiple “sockpuppet” accounts—the corollary to the burnable domains and email
  addresses that are so highly sought after by spammers. But the really bizarre
  phenomena are all the low-level mobbers, who have little-to-no real investment
  in going after the target, and would not manifest any obsessions with that
  particular target without the orchestrator to set them off. Here they resemble
  the zombie nodes of spam botnets,
