  Targets of harassment tend to silence themselves for fear of further abuse.
  Their fears are not unfounded—a consistent pattern is that the harassment
  ramps up the more you talk about it. And so the worst of what they receive
  remains hidden from the public eye. But when someone is so publicly doxed,
  it’s easy to guess what they’re dealing with.
