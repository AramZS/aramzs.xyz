  Yet lurking beneath the thorny legal and doctrinal issues is the great
  paradigm shift of the present digital age, the rise of the conscious and

  recourse to threats online. It’s how Cris Armenta wanted to frame her
  argument, and it is no doubt an important motivating factor to the 2014
  Kozinski decision.
