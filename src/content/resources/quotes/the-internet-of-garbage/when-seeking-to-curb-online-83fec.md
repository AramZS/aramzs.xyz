  When seeking to curb online abuse, reducing anonymity can actually exacerbate
  it. Any anti-harassment policy that looks to “unmask” people is not just a
  threat to, say, anonymous political speech in countries with repressive
  governments; it’s actually counterproductive as an anti-harassment measure in
  the first place.
