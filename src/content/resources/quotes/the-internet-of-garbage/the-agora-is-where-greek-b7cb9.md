  The agora is where Greek democracy begins. And Greek democracy by definition
  excluded women, slaves, and foreigners. When we seek to build truly equal
  platforms and marketplaces of ideas fit for the 21st century, we are trying to
  create things that have never existed and cannot be constructed by mindlessly
  applying principles of the past.
