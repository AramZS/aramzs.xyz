  The Wikimedia Foundation is building new tools that it hopes will help
  Wikipedia editors stay anonymous in part to avoid harassment and legal threats
  as Elon Musk and the Heritage Foundation ramp up their attacks on people who
  edit Wikipedia. Some of the tactics have been pioneered by Wikimedia in
  countries with authoritarian governments and where editing Wikipedia is
  illegal or extremely dangerous.
