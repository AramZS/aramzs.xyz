  The sight of the very same people who routinely demand more police and harsher
  criminal sentences competing to scream the loudest about the injustice of
  convicting a blatant crook for a blatant crime does not really require any
  ornamentation from me. It all speaks for itself. These people are not
  interested in justice; they are interested in oppression. That is the project
  they are enthusiastic about. From that point of view, the whole spectacle
  makes perfect sense.
