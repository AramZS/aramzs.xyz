  the LIBOR affair at the heart of the UBS settlement was, numerically speaking,
  probably the biggest financial scandal ever. At the time, it was both the
  biggest antitrust case and the biggest price-fixing case ever to surface (some
  serious competitors have since reared their heads). By working together to rig
  global interest rates through their manipulation of the London Interbank
  Offered Rate—a projection of the rate at which banks charge one another to
  borrow and lend money—banks like UBS, Barclays, the Royal Bank of Scotland,
  and perhaps as many as six other companies (according to British regulators)
  impacted the price of hundreds of trillions of dollars of financial products,
  everything from mortgages to credit cards to municipal bonds to swaps and even
  currencies.
