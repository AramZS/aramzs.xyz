  “You’re not going to see any change in tactics overnight,” promised Mayor Mike
  Bloomberg. But the fact that Bloomberg was put in the position of having to
  fight back—and that his successor, Bill de Blasio, won in part by running
  against those tactics—shows that public pressure can work. Just trying to do
  the right thing legitimizes the entire system. We don’t do it often enough.
