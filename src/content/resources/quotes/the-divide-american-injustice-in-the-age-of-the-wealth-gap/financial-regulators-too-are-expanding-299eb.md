  Financial regulators, too, are expanding their range of targets. Once HSBC and
  Barclays and UBS and Chase and Goldman and the rest of the Collateral
  Consequences All-Stars secured their status as unprosecutable, too-big-to-jail
  institutions, the margin of regulatory error suddenly became that much smaller
  for the giant subset of All Other Businesses. The SEC tells Congress it makes
  about 735 enforcement cases a year,*1 and it needs to hit or surpass that
  number every year to expect its budget to keep flowing. But if the SEC has a
  powerful disinclination to make those cases against the Lloyd Blankfeins and
  Jamie Dimons of the world, it’s going to start looking at everyone else’s
  books far more closely. It’s going after smaller businesses more aggressively
  than before. It’s profiling, except it’s expanding the profile. And on the
  flip side, it’s doing the same thing, only in reverse.
