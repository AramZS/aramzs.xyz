  Because shorting a stock becomes more and more expensive the longer the short
  bet is on. Remember, in order to bet against a company, you have to borrow
  shares of that stock. But so many people may be clamoring to short a certain
  stock that the number of shares available for borrowing may not be sufficient
  to meet the demand. In that case (and it can happen for other reasons as
  well), a stock becomes “hard to borrow,” and the cost to borrow a single share
  for any length of time can become exorbitant. Short sellers talk about the
  price of “the borrow” when they figure their costs. And in the case of
  Fairfax, the borrow was through the roof. Between 2003 and 2006, the cost to
  borrow Fairfax stock skyrocketed, to the point where a short seller had to pay
  a surcharge of 30 percent or more just to borrow a share.
