  In point of fact, the average balance in the thousand cases was about a
  thousand dollars—meaning that Chase was really only forgoing about a million
  dollars in collections. In other words, Linda Almonte’s whistle-blowing
  odyssey—a journey that had cost her all her savings, nearly wrecked her
  marriage, and reduced her kids to dependence on food stamps—had ultimately
  cost JPMorgan just a few minutes in profits. From the bank’s point of view,
  Linda’s defection was very nearly a worst-case scenario. And even the worst
  case, it turns out, isn’t all that bad.
