  It’s become a cliché by now, but since 2008, no high-ranking executive from
  any financial institution has gone to jail, not one, for any of the systemic
  crimes that wiped out 40 percent of the world’s wealth. Even now, after
  JPMorgan Chase agreed to a settlement north of $13 billion for a variety of
  offenses and the financial press threw itself up in arms over the government’s
  supposedly aggressive new approach to regulating Wall Street, the basic
  principle held true: Nobody went to jail. Not one person.
