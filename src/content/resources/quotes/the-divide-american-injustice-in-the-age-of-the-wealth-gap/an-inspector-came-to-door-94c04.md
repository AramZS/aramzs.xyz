  An inspector came to her door, barged in, and began rifling through her
  belongings. At one point, he reached into her underwear drawer and began
  sifting around. Sneering, he used the tip of the pencil eraser to pull out a
  pair of sexy panties and looked at her accusingly. If she didn’t have a
  boyfriend, what did she need these for? That image, of a welfare inspector
  sneeringly holding up panties with a pencil end, expresses all sorts of things
  at once. The main thing is contempt. The implication is that someone broke
  enough to ask the taxpayer for a handout shouldn’t have sex, much less sexy
  panties.
