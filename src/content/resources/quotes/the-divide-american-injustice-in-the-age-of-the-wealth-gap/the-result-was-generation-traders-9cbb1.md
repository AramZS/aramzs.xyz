  The result was a generation of traders who exemplified an ethos completely
  opposite that preached by Buffett, Graham, and, well, Prem Watsa: people who
  didn’t invest in companies for the long haul but instead invested in stock
  positions and sometimes held those positions for just a few seconds. These
  people did not think of themselves as part owners of companies. They boarded
  this or that ship only for a few minutes, raped and robbed as much as possible
  from the hold, and then took off back out into the open ocean.
