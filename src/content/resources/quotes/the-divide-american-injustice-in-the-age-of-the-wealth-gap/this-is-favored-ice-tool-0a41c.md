  This is a favored ICE tool called a stipulated order of removal. The usual
  pitch of an ICE official waving a stip order in front of an immigrant is that
  the result, deportation, will be the same as it will be if you contest the
  case, only you’ll spend less time in ICE detention and get to your home
  country faster. This waiver of rights was used to deport 160,000 people
  between 2000 and 2010. Its use exploded after Obama’s election, moving from
  fewer than 5,000 orders a year in 2004 to more than 40,000 in 2008.
