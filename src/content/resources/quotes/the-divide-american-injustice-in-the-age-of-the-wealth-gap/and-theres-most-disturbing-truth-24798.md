  And then there’s the most disturbing truth of all. People assume that a system
  that favors the rich likes rich people. This isn’t true. Our bureaucracies
  respond to the money rich people have, and they bend to the legal might the
  rich can hire, but they don’t give a damn about rich people. You can be rich
  and still fall into any one of a dozen financial/legal meat grinders, from an
  erroneously collapsed credit score to a robo-signed foreclosure to a stolen
  identity to a retirement account vaporized by institutional theft and fraud.
  The system eats up rich people, too, because it’s not concerned with
  protecting any individuals, even the rich ones. These bureaucracies accomplish
  just two things: they make small piles of money smaller and big piles of money
  bigger. It’s a system that doesn’t care whose hands end up holding the bag, or
  how long those hands get to hold the bag. It just relentlessly creates and
  punishes losers, who get to sit beneath an ever-narrowing group of winners,
  who may or may not stay on top for long.
