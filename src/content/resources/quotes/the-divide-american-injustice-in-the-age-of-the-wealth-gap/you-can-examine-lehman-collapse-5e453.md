  You can examine the Lehman collapse and the LIBOR scandal and see the same
  glaring enforcement problems in both narratives. Major regulators like the Fed
  and the SEC knew of frightening problems within both companies and elected (a)
  not to launch criminal investigations and (b) not to tell the investing
  public. You see the state making moves like warning other banks of problems
  within a firm like Lehman, or using public funds to help protect other banks
  from damage caused by Lehman’s collapse. But the public, in the end, gets
  nothing. No justice, and not even a bake sale.
