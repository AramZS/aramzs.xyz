  Obama was echoing the main mantra that continued to emanate from Wall Street
  after the crash, in which high-level executives involved in this or that
  scandal repeatedly insisted that what they had done was not actually against
  the law. The thing that’s interesting about this claim isn’t that it’s
  factually wrong, which incidentally it almost always is, often to a humorously
  enormous degree. What’s interesting is that the people who make this claim
  usually believe it to be true. Even Barack Obama, despite the fact that he’s
  almost universally understood to be an outstanding lawyer and should know
  better, probably believes it to be true. This weird psychological kink is
  where the Divide lives.
