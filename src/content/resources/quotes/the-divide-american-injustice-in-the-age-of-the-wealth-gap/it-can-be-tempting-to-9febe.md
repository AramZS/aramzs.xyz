  It can be tempting to tangle with prominent institutions. But chasing
  headlines and solving problems are two different things. The question is what
  will do most good—where our focus should be. And the record seems to suggest
  that we can do most to protect smaller, unsophisticated investors by focusing
  more attention on smaller entities. In other words, we’ve got a limited
  budget, and there’s a bigger degree of difficulty in going after big banks
  with powerful lawyers. Therefore the SEC shouldn’t give in to the “temptation”
  of tangling with big banks because, rhetorically speaking, those shots are
  harder to make. Better to go for uncontested dunks and lay-ins than heave deep
  threes at the buzzer. This is coward’s language.
