  How many bodies has the state even assigned to gather evidence for these
  difficult cases? How much money has it been willing to spend for that kind of
  justice? It never put together a task force to concentrate on this corruption,
  never had a coordinated strategy. In fact, it barely even studied the problem.
  Fun fact: When the economy crashed in 2008, the federal government formed an
  investigatory group to look into the causes. That Financial Crisis Inquiry
  Committee was given a budget of $9.8 million. Committee chairman Phil
  Angelides acidly noted that this was “roughly one-seventh of the budget of
  Oliver Stone’s Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps.” Meanwhile, that same year the
  federal drug enforcement budget leaped from $13.275 billion to $15.278
  billion. That meant that just the increase in the national drug enforcement
  budget for the year of the biggest financial crisis since the Depression was
  roughly two hundred times the size of the budget for the sole executive branch
  effort at formally investigating the causes of financial corruption.
