  The Bank of England fined Barclays $453 million and essentially demanded that
  Diamond resign, which he did, in the spring of 2012. On his way out, Diamond
  released emails and other documents suggesting that the Bank of England not
  only knew about these manipulations but had actually encouraged them during
  the fall of 2008, right around the time of the Lehman bankruptcy. The
  ostensible justification for the BOE wanting banks to suppress LIBOR at that
  time is that it made banks look healthier and prevented a worldwide panic. But
  there was no excuse at all for the manipulations that Barclays had engaged in
  prior to 2008, the “bottle of Bollinger” manipulations, which were done purely
  to make more money for Barclays and its traders.
