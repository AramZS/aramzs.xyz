  Patrick’s arrest was the essence of stop-and-frisk, which itself was the
  perfect symbol of the new stats-based approach to city policing. You throw a
  big net over a whole city region, bounce some heads off sidewalks, then throw
  back the little fish. Almost as important (and this aspect of it is little
  discussed), you gather intelligence with each catch. The thing is, this
  particular ocean, to push the metaphor a bit further, is getting overfished.
  So they’re trawling more remote waters, the nets being cast are wider. Which
  is a fancy way of saying that it’s not just blacks from Bed-Stuy or Hispanic
  workers in rural Georgia or Mexican single moms living out of vans who are
  getting the treatment. Being white and middle class never meant your kids
  breezed into Yale with a C average. That kind of privilege was always reserved
  for a special kind of wealth. But it did once mean that police would think
  twice before bouncing your head off a sidewalk. Not anymore.
