  Specifically, this was a massive criminal fraud scheme, something akin to a
  giant counterfeiting operation, in which banks mass-produced extremely risky,
  low-quality subprime mortgages and with lightning-quick efficiency sold them
  off to institutional sucker-investors as highly rated AAA bonds. The hot
  potato game targeted unions, pension funds, and government-backed mortgage
  companies like Fannie Mae on the secondary market. It was a modern take on the
  Rumpelstiltskin fairy tale. Big banks took great masses of straw (i.e., the
  risky home loans of the poor, undocumented, and unemployed) and spun it,
  factory style, into gold (i.e., AAA-rated securities). They used a technique
  called securitization that allowed banks and mortgage lenders to take vast
  pools of home loans belonging to underemployed janitors and immigrants and
  magically convert them into investments that were ostensibly as safe as
  Microsoft corporate bonds or the sovereign debt of Luxembourg, but more
  lucrative than either. The sudden introduction of these magic mortgage bonds
  into the marketplace pushed most every major institutional investor in the
  world to suddenly become consumed with the desire to lend money to American
  home borrowers, even if they didn’t know to whom exactly they were lending or
  how exactly these borrowers were qualifying for their home loans. As a result
  of this lunatic process, houses in middle- and lower-income neighborhoods from
  Fresno to the Jersey Shore became jammed full of new home borrowers, millions
  and millions of them, who in many cases were not equal to the task of making
  their monthly payments. The situation was tenable so long as housing prices
  kept rising and these teeming new populations of home borrowers could keep
  their heads above water, selling or refinancing their way out of trouble if
  need be. But the instant the arrow began tilting downward, this rapidly
  expanding death-balloon of phony real estate value inevitably had to—and
  did—explode. In other words, it was a Ponzi scheme, no different than the
  Bernie Madoff caper, only executed on an exponentially huger scale. The scheme
  depended upon the ability of a nexus of large financial companies to
  factory-produce and sell these magic home loans fast enough, and in big enough
  numbers, to continually keep more money coming in than going out.
