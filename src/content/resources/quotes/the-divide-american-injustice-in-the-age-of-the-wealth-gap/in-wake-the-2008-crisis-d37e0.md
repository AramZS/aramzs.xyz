  In the wake of the 2008 crisis, Clinton is most frequently criticized for
  overseeing two radical changes to our regulatory structure: the repeal of the
  Glass-Steagall Act to allow the mergers of investment banks, commercial banks,
  and insurance companies, and the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000,
  which deregulated the burgeoning derivatives market. Less commonly understood
  is that Clinton, Greenspan, Rubin, and Summers also oversaw the collapse of
  what are known as “selective credit controls,” the tools used to rein in
  irresponsible lending. Rules like the Federal Reserve’s Regulations X and W,
  which mandated minimum down payments for things like home and automobile
  loans, were watered down if not eliminated completely during the Clinton
  years, and regulators under Clinton likewise refused to insist that banks and
  financial companies at least jack up their reserve capital to match all the
  crazy lending they were doing.
