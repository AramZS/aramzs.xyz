  The two hard-luck cases were a mid-level GE executive and, wait for it, his
  kung-fu instructor. The two had conspired to make a $157,000 trade ahead of
  the merger. You can look it up: United States v. Anthony Chrysikos and Michael
  Martello, filed in 2002. These two idiots realized a total profit of
  $157,259.09. Chrysikos, the GE exec, ended up getting fifteen months in jail
  for the crime. Samberg, meanwhile, made $18 million on his Heller trade, and
  Mack made about $10 million through the seemingly linked Lucent deal. But Mack
  got off scot free and was not even interviewed until right after the statute
  of limitations expired.
