  Then came Arthur Andersen. The venerable accounting firm was swept up in the
  Enron scandal and charged criminally by the Bush Justice Department for
  destroying files and perhaps collaborating in Enron’s accounting schemes. The
  government offered the company a deferred prosecution agreement, one that
  would have required an admission of wrongdoing. Arthur Andersen wanted no part
  of that.
