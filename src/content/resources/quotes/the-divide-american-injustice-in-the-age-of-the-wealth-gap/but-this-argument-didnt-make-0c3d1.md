  But this argument didn’t make sense with regard to individuals, and if you
  thought about it, it didn’t make sense with regard to companies, either. “You
  can’t just say, ‘We can’t indict because they’re too big’ and then just throw
  up your hands,” says Barofsky. “If a bank’s size is the only thing preventing
  you from indicting, making the bank smaller should be a condition of the
  settlement, so it doesn’t happen again. If you’ve got them by the short hairs,
  you’ve got to make them break up.”
