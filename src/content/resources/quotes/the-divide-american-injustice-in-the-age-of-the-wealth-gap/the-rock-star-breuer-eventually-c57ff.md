  The “rock star” Breuer eventually hired to run the Fraud Section was Denis
  McInerney of the white-shoe defense firm Davis Polk, whose main claim to fame
  was—get this—defending Arthur Andersen in its obstruction-of-justice case.
  McInerney hadn’t prosecuted a case in over fifteen years at the time of his
  hire.
