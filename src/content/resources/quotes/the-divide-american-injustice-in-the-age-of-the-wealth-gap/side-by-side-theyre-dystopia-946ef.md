  side by side they’re a dystopia, where common city courts become factories for
  turning poor people into prisoners, while federal prosecutors on the
  white-collar beat turn into overpriced garbage men, who behind closed doors
  quietly dispose of the sins of the rich for a fee. And it’s evolved this way
  over time and for a thousand reasons, so that almost nobody is aware of the
  whole picture, the two worlds so separate that they’re barely visible to each
  other. The usual political descriptors like “unfairness” and “injustice” don’t
  really apply. It’s more like a breakdown into madness.
