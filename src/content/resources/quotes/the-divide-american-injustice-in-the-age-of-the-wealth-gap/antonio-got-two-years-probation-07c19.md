  Antonio got two years of probation and 180 hours of community service. Nobody
  is saying people like this aren’t guilty, or that there shouldn’t be a
  punishment for deceiving the government and for making taxpayers pay the
  medical bills for her and her husband’s three kids. But if her crime gets
  punished, someone else committing the same crime has to receive the same
  punishment. This stuff isn’t brain surgery. But there just aren’t cases of
  bankers or mortgage lenders doing jail time or lengthy community service
  stints for dumping bad loans into mortgage pools. Nobody from a bank or a
  ratings agency is losing his or her kids or housing because he or she sold or
  helped sell bad loans to, say, King County, Washington, or the Iowa Student
  Loan Liquidity Corporation. It just doesn’t happen. The method for dealing
  with that kind of offender increasingly involves fines and noncriminal
  sanctions. Responsibility for the fraud redounds to the institution, which
  takes the punishment. The only thing that changes is that as the economy
  stagnates more and more, and the wealth divide gets bigger, it becomes less
  and less possible for law enforcement to imagine the jail-or-garbage option
  for the Collateral Consequences crowd, and more and more possible to imagine
  it for an ever-expanding population of Everyone Else.
