  So how do you collect money from a cardholder who doesn’t answer his or her
  summons? That’s easy: you take it! The laws are different from state to state,
  but in most places in America, once the bank or debt buyer has that default
  judgment in hand, it can legally do just about anything to the cardholder. It
  can put a lien on his property, it can attach her salary, it can even take his
  car or her office furniture. A bank or debt buyer’s collection powers aren’t
  as elaborate as, say, the federal government’s powers to reseize money owed by
  student borrowers. But they’re a lot broader than you would think.
