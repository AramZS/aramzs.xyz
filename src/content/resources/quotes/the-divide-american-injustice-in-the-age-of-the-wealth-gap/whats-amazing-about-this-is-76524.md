  What’s amazing about this is that the Fed saw fit as early as January 2008 to
  warn Chase about Lehman’s instability. But nobody ever warned the public.
  Nobody stepped in after the bank cooked its books in Repo 105, or misreported
  taxes, or made fake disclosures, or lied outright to investors. Nothing was
  done. The government merely sat back and watched the catastrophe unfold,
  allowing new victims to pour money into the walking-dead bank right up until
  its collapse.
