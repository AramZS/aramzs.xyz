  As one government source explained it, “The FBI went ape-shit” when they saw
  the Boyd piece. The sheer embarrassment of having a prank-calling Matchstick
  Men wannabe like Contogouris claiming in public to be a deputized FBI
  operative was a terrible black eye for the Bureau, which was eventually forced
  to answer questions about the incident in a Senate Judiciary Committee
  hearing. Asked about the Post story, and Contogouris specifically, FBI
  director Robert Mueller answered icily, “The FBI does not deputize members of
  the general public.”
