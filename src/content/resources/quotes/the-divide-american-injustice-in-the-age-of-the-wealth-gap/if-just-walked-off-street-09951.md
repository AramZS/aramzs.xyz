  If you just walked in off the street and watched that scene, you wouldn’t
  think much of it. But to people who do this for a living, the decision by a
  haggard and probably homeless streetwalker to pay a fine for a bad arrest
  comes down to an elaborate series of mathematical calculations, most of which
  the public has no conception of. In a vacuum, that prostitute’s case probably
  would have been tossed out. There was something wrong with the arrest, and if
  it were somehow to go all the way to trial, the state would probably lose, a
  fact seemingly recognized by all sides in their brief, ten-second
  deliberation. But the state doesn’t have to win at trial, a truth captured in
  another common expression in this courtroom: “The punishment is the process.”
