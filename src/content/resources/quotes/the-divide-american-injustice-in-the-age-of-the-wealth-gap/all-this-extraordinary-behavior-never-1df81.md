  All this extraordinary behavior never took place a few decades ago. Credit
  card companies almost never sued delinquent cardholders, particularly those
  with small balances. It simply wasn’t economical for companies to devote any
  resources at all to chasing after a thousand dollars here and there. But as
  time passed, and the machinery of collections became more streamlined and
  brutal, we reached the current state of affairs. Now a Chase bank executive
  can sit in an office in San Antonio and with a few brief keystrokes transfer
  the right to seize the salary and automobile of a stranger in Chicago or
  Newark to some random company in Louisiana. At one point in time that process
  also required significant legal due diligence and the transfer of
  documentation, but executives soon realized that in the overwhelmed modern
  court system, simply attesting to having the right documentation works just as
  well as really having it. This is the same realization that struck Bank of
  America when it found that saying it had foreclosure documents was almost as
  good as having them—and the same one that touched process servers at American
  Legal Process, who found that claiming to have delivered a summons was almost
  as good as (and certainly cheaper than) actually doing it.
