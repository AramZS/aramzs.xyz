  Since the great welfare reforms of the mid-1990s, when Bill Clinton broke up
  the traditional welfare state and introduced reforms like workfare and the end
  to permanent cash aid, the entire welfare apparatus has gone through a
  transformation, wherein thousands of people who were caseworkers previously
  became fraud investigators under the new system. “Sometimes, they even kept
  the same offices,” says Gustafson. “They would take a welfare caseworker,
  retrain him or her to be a fraud investigator, and put him or her back in the
  same desk.” In many places (and San Diego is one such place), the welfare
  caseworkers and fraud investigators working for the DA’s office actually work
  out of the same building, wing, or office.
