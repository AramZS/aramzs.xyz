  Her seven children and her husband will almost certainly stay here in America.
  So she has a year left with her family. All because she got her fender nicked
  on the way to pick up some milk. The number of stories like this boggles the
  mind. Three hundred ninety-six thousand, nine hundred and six people were
  deported from the United States in 2011.
