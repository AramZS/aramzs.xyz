  So we’ve built a massive and ruthless police apparatus for the ordinary
  immigrant population, complete with a sprawling, essentially extralegal
  detention complex, to catch and detain people who have not committed any
  actual crimes. This gigantic, menacing complex of bars, chains, buses, and
  airplanes built to deal with the immigrant poor stands in stark contrast to
  the tiny, disorganized confederation of perhaps a few hundred lawyers policing
  transnational financial companies. We don’t have special jails for foreigners
  or executives from foreign firms who steal by the million or billion.
