  All the collectors have, typically, is a complaint and the assertion of an
  owed balance. But in the vast majority of cases, that’s enough. Two-thirds of
  the time, the defendant doesn’t show and loses automatically. Others get the
  summons, assume they really do owe the balance stated, and either agree to pay
  or settle, never forcing the bank to prove its claims.
