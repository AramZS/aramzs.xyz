  In May 2012, Mary Schapiro testified before the House Appropriations Committee
  about the SEC whistle-blower program. She told the House that the program was
  “already providing high-quality information,” but when asked how many awards
  had actually been paid out, she admitted—none. The program was just under two
  years old, and not a single whistle-blower case had been made.
