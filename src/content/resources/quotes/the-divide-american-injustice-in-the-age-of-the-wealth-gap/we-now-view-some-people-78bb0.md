  we now view some people as having no rights at all. They can be assassinated
  or detained indefinitely outside any sort of legal framework, from the Geneva
  conventions on down. Even here at home, that concept is growing. After the
  Boston marathon bombings, there was briefly a controversy where we wondered
  aloud whether the Chechen suspects would be read Miranda rights upon capture.
  No matter how angry you were about those bombings—and as a Boston native, I
  wanted whoever was responsible thrown in the deepest hole we have—it was a
  fascinating moment in our history. It was the first time when we actually
  weren’t sure if an American criminal suspect would get full access to due
  process of law. Even on television, the blow-dried talking heads didn’t know
  the answer. We had to think about it.
