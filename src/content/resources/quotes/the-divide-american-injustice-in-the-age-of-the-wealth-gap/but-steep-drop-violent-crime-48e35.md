  But the steep drop in violent crime presented police with a problem. If making
  arrests is the only way to advance in your career, but crime is dropping, what
  do you do? Furthermore, what to do if the only way to make a living wage is to
  rack up as much overtime as possible? In the Safir era, NYPD starting salaries
  were on the low end for professional police forces in America, beginning at
  about forty thousand dollars. How do you add hours in an era when crime is
  dropping? The answer turned out to be, you simply create arrests.
