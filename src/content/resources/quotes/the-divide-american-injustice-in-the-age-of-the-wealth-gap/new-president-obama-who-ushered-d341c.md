  new president Obama, who ushered in a herd of Ivy Leaguers and high-powered
  corporate defense lawyers to be his top crime-fighting officials. This new
  crowd of bookish lawyers was headlined by the Columbia University/Covington &
  Burling duo of Holder as attorney general and Lanny Breuer as head of
  Justice’s Criminal Division, essentially the top crime-fighting job in the
  country. This new crew, derided as “tourists” by two different ex–DOJ
  officials I spoke with, attacked their posts with the attitudes of corporate
  lawyers, stressing risk avoidance above all and insisting that senior-level
  officials have their fingers in the smallest of pies.
