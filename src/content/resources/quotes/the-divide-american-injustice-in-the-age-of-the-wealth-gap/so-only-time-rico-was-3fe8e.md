  So the only time RICO was used to fight mortgage fraud was when the criminal
  was a black gang member and the victims were banks. (Ironically, nobody
  thought to wonder how it was possible for a Lincoln Park gang member to buy
  222 houses with no money down. Heading into that particular rabbit hole would
  have led to the larger crime, but nobody did.)
