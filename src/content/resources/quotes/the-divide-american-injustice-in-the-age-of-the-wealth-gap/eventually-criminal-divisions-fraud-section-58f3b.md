  Eventually, the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section would be entirely
  deemphasized in favor of a shiny new Obama-created institution called the
  Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force, which was created around the same time
  that McInerney was hired. Morale at the Justice Department plummeted after
  that, thanks to a series of strange decisions. For one thing, Holder decided
  not to retry Stevens, continuing a pattern of backing off big cases after
  setbacks.
