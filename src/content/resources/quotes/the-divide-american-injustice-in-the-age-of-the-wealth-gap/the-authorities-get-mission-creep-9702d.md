  the authorities get mission creep. Convictions are so easy, the police
  eventually stop waiting for the actual crime to be committed. Instead of
  waiting to watch a sex act for pay actually take place, the police, even
  better, will simply arrest a woman for “loitering for the purpose of engaging
  in a prostitution offense.”
