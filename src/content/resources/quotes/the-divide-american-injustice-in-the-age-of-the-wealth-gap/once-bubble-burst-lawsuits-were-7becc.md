  Once the bubble burst, lawsuits were filed everywhere and whistle-blowers
  emerged by the dozen, showing, in graphic documentary detail, how nearly every
  major financial company in America had chosen to participate in this enormous
  fraud. It was the very definition of systemic corruption, but curiously,
  despite what looked like mountains of evidence, almost nobody with any
  connection to the crisis was even threatened with criminal prosecution. For
  instance, court filings showed that Bank of America—a Covington & Burling
  client, remember—had teamed up with the unscrupulous, now-defunct mortgage
  lender Countrywide to sell more than a billion dollars’ worth of questionable
  loans to Fannie and Freddie. They had done so through a special mortgage loan
  program that, unbelievably, was named “Hustle” in internal bank documents.
  Under “Hustle,” Bank of America intentionally removed underwriters and
  compliance officers from the loan origination process, explicitly aiming to
  make sure that loans “moved forward, never backward.”
