  Clinton understood that putting the Democrats back in the business of banging
  on black dependency would allow his party to reseize the political middle that
  Democrats had lost when Lyndon Johnson threw the weight of the White House
  behind the civil rights effort and the War on Poverty. If you dig deeply
  enough in America, the big political swings always have something to do with
  race. And Clinton’s vacillating but cleverly packaged campaign to “end welfare
  as we know it” was a brilliant ploy by the man Toni Morrison called the “first
  black president” to take back the southern white voters the Democrats had
  seemingly lost forever when they sent the FBI into Alabama and Mississippi in
  the 1960s. That, and a little rolled-up-newspaper training session with rapper
  Sister Souljah, allowed Clinton to take four of the eleven Confederate states,
  seizing ground no Democrat had won for more than two decades.
