  instance, opined that people who demonstrate low self-control in “a wide
  variety of criminal and analogous behaviors”—people who have issues with
  drinking or drugs, or have problems with school, interpersonal relationships,
  and keeping a job—“will not specialize in some [crimes] to the exclusion of
  others.” In other words: Low-class people do low-class things. This same
