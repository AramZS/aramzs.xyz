  There would come a time when the Lehman creditors would be able to see the
  contours of the whole heist. They would have documents, emails, admissions
  even. But almost precisely at that moment of evidentiary victory, they were
  politically and legally checkmated. The creditors were thrust face-first into
  the immovable principle that underlies everything modern that Wall Street
  does: if a crime is complicated enough, and sanctified by enough “reputable”
  attorneys and accountants, then American law enforcement will inevitably be
  too slow or too weak to stop it.
