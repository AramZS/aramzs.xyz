  The stories you hear from people who’ve disappeared at checkpoints and
  roadblocks sound eerily like the literature of the Soviet gulag, with the same
  themes of repeat interrogations, marches, chains, total alienation from
  family, and clashes with harsh nature, lunatic bureaucracies, and petty human
  predators of every imaginable species, some wearing uniforms and some not.
