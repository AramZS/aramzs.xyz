  The basic scheme—mass-producing and mismarking mortgages—was exacerbated by
  other major industrywide ethical failures. Many of these same firms, in their
  desperation to cut every conceivable cost en route to the creation of
  mortgages, knowingly engaged in mass perjury by creating whole departments of
  entry-level cubicle slaves devoted to “robo-signing”—read: inventing—chains of
  title and other key documents. In other cases, they hired outside companies to
  do the dirty work for them. In just one single locale, the clerk’s office in
  Essex County, Massachusetts, thirteen hundred different mortgage documents,
  including chains of title, were discovered to have been signed by a “Linda
  Green,” although the signatures were written in twenty-two different styles.
  “Linda Green” worked for a company called DocX, which at the height of the
  boom was processing about half of all the foreclosure documents in the United
  States.
