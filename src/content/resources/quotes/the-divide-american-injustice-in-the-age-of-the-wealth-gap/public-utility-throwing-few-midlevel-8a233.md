  public utility of throwing a few midlevel peons from a bank like HSBC in jail
  versus collecting 1.9 billion actual dollars. What’s better, they ask, for the
  state? What’s better for the people? With some regulatory agencies like the
  SEC, the settlements they collect go directly to victims. Within the walls of
  those agencies, the calculus starts to feel exactly like the math employed by
  any private civil law firm, where you’re weighing the possibility of getting
  nothing at all versus the chance, today, at $100 million or $200 million. So
  given these factors, prosecutors will tell you that these massive financial
  settlements, and the binding deferred prosecution agreements that
  theoretically give the government enormous leverage over these offender firms,
  are not only good deals, they’re great deals. This sounds like a good
  argument, it really does. Trapped in a room with a federal prosecutor who
  argues for a living, you would find yourself buying it. But it’s bullshit.
  It’s belied by the entire history of these settlements.
