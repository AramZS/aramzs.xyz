  Since the mid-2000s, and especially since 2008, we’ve seen one settlement
  after another with the same characteristics: very high fines, limited (or no)
  admission of responsibility, and no criminal charges against individuals. It’s
  an incredibly long list. Take just one company, Bank of America, which paid
  out some $29 billion in settlements between 2009 and September 2012.
