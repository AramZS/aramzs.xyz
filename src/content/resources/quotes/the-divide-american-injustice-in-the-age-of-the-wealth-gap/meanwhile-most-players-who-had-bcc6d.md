  Meanwhile, most of the players who had actually pushed white-collar cases to
  trial in the pre-Obama years were quietly phased out. Kirk Ogrosky, who had
  run the health care fraud division, left in April 2010. Deputy Chief Mark
  Mendelsohn, who had run Foreign Corrupt Practices Act cases, left that same
  year. Another deputy chief, Paul Pelletier, called the “heart and soul” of the
  Fraud Section by reporters at the DOJ watchdog site Main Justice, left in
  2011. Fraud chief Steve Tyrrell left in early 2011 as well.
