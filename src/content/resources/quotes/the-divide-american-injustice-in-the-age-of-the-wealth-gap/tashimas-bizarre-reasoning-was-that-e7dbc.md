  Tashima’s bizarre reasoning was that the P100 visits were not searches under
  the Fourth Amendment—but even if they were searches, they were not
  unreasonable. Why are they reasonable? Because, Tashima said, the public “has
  a strong interest in ensuring that aid provided from tax dollars reaches its
  proper and intended recipients.” So the standard is, anyone who receives aid
  from taxpayers forgoes his rights, because the state has a “strong interest”
  in rooting out fraud.
