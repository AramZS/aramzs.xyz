  “The [earnings statement], that was like that Robert Conrad ad where he’s
  daring you to knock the battery off his shoulder,” laughs another creditor
  attorney. “I mean, they come out five months after the sale, and they’re like,
  ‘Oh, by the way, we made four billion dollars on the deal.’ And we’re like ‘Oh
  yeah? How?’ It was the red flag of red flags.” Furious, the creditor attorneys
  pounded down the door of the Barclays-Lehman attorneys, demanding answers. How
  did you make $4 billion on the deal? Where had the gain come from? But they
  got bubkes.
