  You steal from uninformed investors all over the world, a few pennies or
  dollars at a time. The damage fans out evenly across a vast geography, and
  it’s hard to see. It’s because of this that lots of Wall Street people
  genuinely think of insider trading and naked short selling as victimless
  crimes. People get hurt, sure, but the victims are mostly sophisticated
  investors who should know better, and it’s not like you’re hitting them in the
  head with a brick or anything. It’s not a real crime. At least it doesn’t look
  like one. That may once have been true. But in the Fairfax case, the
  principals in this “victimless” scheme started to mimic the gangster
  aesthetic. Like most privileged, overeducated Americans who try it, they would
  suck at being real tough guys. They tried, however, and here’s the crazy
  thing: in a city where police in some neighborhoods define crime as standing
  on the sidewalk the wrong way, these idiots took their stock-trading
  act-like-a-thug life, screwed it up a hundred different ways, and not only
  couldn’t get arrested, they couldn’t even get police of any kind to notice.
