  Incredibly, the DOJ still ultimately lost the Clemens case, and it was the way
  they lost it that was most distressing. “There were two pieces of evidence in
  that case, the needle and the trainer, and it still took them ten weeks to put
  on the trial,” groans one former federal prosecutor. “And they lost. That’s
  the kind of thing that makes you hesitate before you try a
  credit-default-swaps case.”
