  In the summer of 2012, a judge named Noach Dear, rotating into Brooklyn for
  part-time duty, infuriated the city when he challenged the public drinking
  summons of a Latino man named Julio Figueroa. “As hard as I try, I cannot
  recall ever arraigning a white defendant for such a violation,” he told The
  New York Times. He later had his staff check and found that only 4 percent of
  all public drinking summonses were issued to whites, while 85 percent went to
  blacks and Latinos. Ultimately this all comes down to discretion. If they
  want, the police can arrest you for just about anything.
