  So what happens? Many process servers and law firms engage in a
  wink-wink-nudge-nudge business called gutter service or sewer service, in
  which the law firm hands the list of summonses to the server, and the server
  simply dumps them (in the “gutter,” hence the name). In return, the process
  server hands the law firm an “affidavit of service,” swearing that he properly
  served the customer. Process service once required a signature of the
  defendant to prove proper service; now all that’s needed is the server’s own
  word that he did the job.
