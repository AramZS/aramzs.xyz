  In that highly sordid and mostly overlooked chapter in the history of the
  bailout period, WaMu and its $307 billion in assets were delivered by the
  state into the hands of Chase and its CEO, Jamie Dimon, for the preposterously
  low price of $1.9 billion, a bargain deal that was struck just a few weeks
  before Chase was given $25 billion in cash by the government as part of the
  TARP bailouts. This was Chase’s second sweetheart deal in less than a year.
