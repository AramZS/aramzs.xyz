  the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act, which had prevented the mergers of
  commercial banks, investment banks, and insurance companies (this repeal led
  to the creation of megafirms like Citigroup), and Supreme Court decisions
  rolling back bans on interstate banking (which led to a string of mergers,
  resulting in the formation of giant national banks like Wachovia and Bank of
  America). In the finance sector at least, these changes allowed companies to
  be more enormous and difficult to regulate than they ever had been before.
