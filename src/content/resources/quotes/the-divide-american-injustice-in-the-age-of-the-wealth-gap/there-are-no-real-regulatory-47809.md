  There are no real regulatory audits of hedge funds, and no government body
  checks hedge funds’ trades or verifies their claims. It even came out, in the
  famous Bernie Madoff case, that despite numerous complaints to the SEC over
  the years from reputable sources, nobody in the government even checked to
  make sure Madoff’s hedge fund even made trades at all. Madoff actually went
  more than thirteen years without making a single stock purchase and yet
  somehow survived several SEC investigations—that’s how flimsy government
  regulation of hedge funds has been and still is.
