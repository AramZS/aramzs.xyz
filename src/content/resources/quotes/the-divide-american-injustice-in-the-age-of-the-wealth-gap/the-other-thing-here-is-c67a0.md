  The other thing here is an idea that being that poor means you should
  naturally give up any ideas you might have about privacy or dignity. The
  welfare applicant is less of a person for being financially dependent (and a
  generally unwelcome immigrant from a poor country to boot), so she naturally
  has fewer rights. No matter how offensive the image is, it has a weird logic
  that’s irresistible to many if not most Americans. Even if we don’t agree with
  it, we all get it.
