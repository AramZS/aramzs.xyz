  It didn’t happen. On February 22, 2011, Judge Peck sent down his ruling on the
  Barclays-Lehman case. The 103-page ruling is, to put it kindly, a hilarious
  cop-out from a legal standpoint. Peck flatly denied all relief to the Lehman
  creditors. His reasoning was based entirely on the idea that nothing would
  have been different if all these ugly facts had been disclosed.
