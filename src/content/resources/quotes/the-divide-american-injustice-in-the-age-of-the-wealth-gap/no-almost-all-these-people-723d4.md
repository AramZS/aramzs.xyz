blockquote: "No, almost all these people come from nonwhite or poor New York, and they’re all people who don’t have eight hundred dollars in cash in a bank account. Lawyers at the courts on Schermerhorn Street, where many of Brooklyn’s cases play out, have a word for bail set just high enough so that people can’t pay, but low enough so that bail bondsmen won’t take the business. “They call it ‘nuisance bail,’\_” says Jane Fox, a public defender. The courts didn’t spend most of their time on this kind of stuff twenty or thirty years ago."
