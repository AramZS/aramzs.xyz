  The problem is, if the law is applied unequally enough over a long enough
  period of time, at some point, law enforcement becomes politically
  illegitimate. Whole classes of arrests become (circle one) illegal, improper,
  morally unenforceable. We have to be really close to that point now. Too many
  of the same damning themes keep jumping out.
