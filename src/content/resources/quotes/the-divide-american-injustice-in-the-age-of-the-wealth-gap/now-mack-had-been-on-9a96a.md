  Now, Mack had been on Samberg’s case to cut him in on a deal involving a
  spinoff of Lucent. “Mack is busting my chops” to let him in on the Lucent
  deal, Samberg told a coworker. So when Mack returned from Switzerland, he
  called Samberg. Samberg suddenly decided to buy every Heller share in sight.
  Then he cut Mack into the Lucent deal, a favor that was worth $10 million to
  Mack. Dot connects to dot: a seemingly open-and-shut case. The SEC refused to
  investigate this highly suspicious-looking series of events, denying Aguirre
  the right even to talk to Mack about these trades. Again, this is well known
  and became the central focus of widely covered Senate hearings later in the
  decade. Aguirre was eventually ruled to have been wrongfully terminated and
  won a $755,000 settlement from the SEC.
