  Wall Street in 2003 was a very different place from the world Ben Graham had
  written about in his 1934 Security Analysis. A more definitive portrait of
  modern finance would probably be the movie Wall Street, which had a profound
  effect on the city’s business culture, although probably not the effect its
  heavy-handed lefty director Oliver Stone expected. While the rest of America
  understood Michael Douglas’s iconic Gordon Gekko character as a villain, and
  saw his famed “greed is good” speech as incisive satire, many aspiring Wall
  Street traders sincerely thought—and still think—that Gekko was the movie’s
  hero.
