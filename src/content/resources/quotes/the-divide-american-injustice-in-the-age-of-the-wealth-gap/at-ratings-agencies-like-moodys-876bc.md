  At the ratings agencies like Moody’s and Fitch and Standard & Poor’s, which
  performed the critical-to-the-fraud function of overrating the toxic mortgage
  securities, high-ranking executives openly discussed in emails the corrupt
  corporate strategy of giving phony ratings in exchange for cash from the big
  banks. “Lord help our fucking scam,” wrote one executive from Standard &
  Poor’s. In another, one of the company’s top analysts complained that the
  firm’s model for rating mortgages was no more accurate than “flipping a coin.”
