  This suggests that when judges set bail in these nuisance cases, they’re
  carefully picking numbers just high enough to keep people in jail. A study by
  Human Rights Watch from 2008 bore this out. They looked at 117,064 nonfelony
  cases in New York that year and found that more than three-fourths of the
  defendants were released on their own recognizance. But 19,137 of the
  defendants were given bail of $1,000 or less, and an incredible 87 percent of
  those still couldn’t post bail. Those people who couldn’t make bail spent an
  average of fifteen days in jail awaiting trial. Think about that. That’s more
  than 16,500 people a year who did an average of two weeks in jail for
  misdemeanors.
