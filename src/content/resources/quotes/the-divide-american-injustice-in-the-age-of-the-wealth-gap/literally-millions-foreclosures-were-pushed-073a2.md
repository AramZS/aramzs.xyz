  literally millions of foreclosures were pushed into court by banks brandishing
  perjured and/or fraudulent paperwork. Many of the phony docs were MERS
  mortgages. The register of deeds in just one city, Salem, Massachusetts, sent
  Holder the paperwork for 31,897 fraudulent foreclosure documents and asked for
  a criminal investigation, because of the “pattern of fraud” they demonstrated.
  Holder passed.
