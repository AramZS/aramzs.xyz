  But what Breuer and Holder were saying at the UBS presser made no sense at
  all. How would arresting executives for serious crimes affect “innocent
  victims”? It wasn’t as though hauling away a few dozen rate fixers at UBS, or
  a few especially guilty money launderers at HSBC, would lead to the
  destruction of those firms.
