  The federal government never really stepped up to the plate. The job was left
  to the states, and even they could come up with only one target. That target,
  it turned out, was Abacus Federal Savings Bank. There were a million ironies
  in the choice of this particular institution, but one of the most striking was
  that the case grew out of an incident that the bank itself had reported to the
  authorities.
