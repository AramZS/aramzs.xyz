  For a country founded on the idea that rights are inalienable and inherent
  from birth, we’ve developed a high tolerance for conditional rights and
  conditional citizenship. And the one condition, it turns out, is money. If you
  have a lot of it, the legal road you get to travel is well lit and beautifully
  maintained. If you don’t, it’s a dark alley and most Americans would be
  shocked to find out what’s at the end of it.
