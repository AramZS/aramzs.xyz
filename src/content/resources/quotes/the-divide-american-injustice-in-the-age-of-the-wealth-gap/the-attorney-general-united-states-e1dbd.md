  The attorney general of the United States was saying that the economy had
  grown so complicated that his own office was now and henceforth helpless to
  decide on its own when it was okay to prosecute, that before it moved against
  any high-powered target, it needed to ask the “experts” on Wall Street if the
  economy would survive such an action.
