  But if you don’t make bail, you’ll almost automatically spend at least that
  long in jail waiting for trial. The state knows this, so essentially, charging
  a person who can’t make bail with a B misdemeanor is the same as convicting
  that person. You file the charge, the judge sets high bail, you go back
  inside, and then you eventually plead to time served, because, well, why not?
  You’ve already done the time.
