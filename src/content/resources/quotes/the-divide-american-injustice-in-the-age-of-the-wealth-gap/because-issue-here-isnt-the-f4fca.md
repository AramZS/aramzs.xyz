  Because the issue here isn’t the efficacy of the welfare state. This is about
  fairness. Do we treat people the same way everywhere? How does a poor person
  end up getting arrested for fraud, and does the state have the same playbook
  for rich people? The obvious answer is no, but you have to see the difference
  up close, at a day-to-day level, to really grasp the breadth of the gap. When
  you see, up close, where the awesome power of the American criminal justice
  space station is directed, you will begin scratching your head, no matter what
  you think of people on welfare.
