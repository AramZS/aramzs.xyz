  The more risk the bank took on, the more money they made in the short term,
  and that was what it was all about. It wasn’t enough to be the fiftieth- or
  sixtieth-richest guy on Wall Street. They wanted to personally be billionaires
  many times over, like the partners at Goldman or celebrated private equity
  chiefs like their departed betters, Steve Schwarzman and Pete Peterson.
