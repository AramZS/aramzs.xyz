  At the national level, at the systemic level, government response was
  virtually nonexistent. The federal government pushed exactly one single
  criminal prosecution against individuals at a major bank for crimes related to
  the financial crisis, a fraud case involving two testosterone-jacked Bear
  Stearns hedge funders who had told investors in their subprime-laden fund that
  they were “comfortable with where they are” just days after one of them
  privately confided to his wife that “the subprime market is toast.” That fund
  later imploded, helping cause the collapse of Bear Stearns, which in turn
  helped trigger the financial crisis. Despite a seeming abundance of damning
  emails and text messages, a jury acquitted, and the Justice Department never
  stepped to the plate again.
