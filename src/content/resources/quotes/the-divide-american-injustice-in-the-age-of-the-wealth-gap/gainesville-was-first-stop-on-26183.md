  Gainesville was the first stop on a tour I took of a vast archipelago of
  roadblocks, convoys, and detention centers built and maintained specifically
  for a certain kind of alien—the poor, non-European kind. The archipelago,
  which has grown at breakneck speed over the last two decades, is like a giant
  legal purgatory in which detainees don’t have any real rights or enjoy any
  real due process. People disappear into it, hundreds of thousands a year, and
  become less like prisoners with rights than like objects or packages to be
  crated and shipped out like cargo. ICE even has a UPS-style tracking system
  that allows immigrant families to punch in a number and see where their
  deported relative is in his or her serpentine journey through the detention
  system. In the real justice system, you get habeas corpus; in the shadow
  system, you get a tracking number to see where your familial “package” is.
