  Mack in other words was the perfect symbol of the idea, generally accepted on
  Wall Street, that lying and cheating to make money is acceptable. The code
  word for this concept is “sophistication,” meaning that it’s okay to screw
  certain kinds of investors because, after all, anyone doing business with
  Goldman Sachs should be “sophisticated” enough to look out for that sort of
  thing.
