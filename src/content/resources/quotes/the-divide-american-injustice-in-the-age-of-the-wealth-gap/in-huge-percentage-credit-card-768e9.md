  in a huge percentage of credit card cases, the cardholder never even sees the
  summons and consequently never appears in court to defend himself. For
  instance, in the year many of these cases were pursued, 2009, there were
  240,000 filings of credit card suits in New York City alone. In an astonishing
  158,000 of those cases, the creditor won a default judgment. “In two-thirds of
  the cases,” says Straniere, “no one even shows up.”
