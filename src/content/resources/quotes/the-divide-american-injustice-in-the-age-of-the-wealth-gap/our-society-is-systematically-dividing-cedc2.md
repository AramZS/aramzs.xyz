  our society is systematically dividing the population into winners and losers,
  using institutions like the courts to speed the process. Winners get rich and
  get off. Losers go broke and go to jail. It isn’t just that some clever crook
  on Wall Street can steal a billion dollars and never see the inside of a
  courtroom; it’s that, plus the fact that some black teenager a few miles away
  can go to jail just for standing on a street corner, that makes the whole
  picture complete.
