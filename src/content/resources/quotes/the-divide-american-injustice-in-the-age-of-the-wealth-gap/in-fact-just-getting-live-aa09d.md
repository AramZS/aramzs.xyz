  In fact, just getting a live human being to look at each and every file for
  more than a few seconds, or to individually prepare the evidence for every
  lawsuit, would make the cost of litigation prohibitive for these massive
  companies. Therefore the only way to make this thing work to scale is to fully
  automate the litigation process. You must reduce the entire business to a
  series of dumb mechanical maneuvers that ruthlessly eliminate even the mere
  possibility of subjective judgment. And that’s exactly how it is. The system
  is really a game of mathematical probabilities that the companies have built
  around the high likelihood of obtaining uncontested legal judgments.
