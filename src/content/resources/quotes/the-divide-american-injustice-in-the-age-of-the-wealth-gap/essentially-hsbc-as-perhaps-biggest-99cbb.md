  Essentially, HSBC, as perhaps the biggest and most accessible “reputable” bank
  in Asia, Africa, Central America, and the Middle East, had enthusiastically
  opened its vaults, including its American vaults, for most every kind of
  antisocial and/or criminal organization on the planet, allowing mass
  murderers, human traffickers, and embezzlers unfettered access to the safety
  and comfort of U.S. dollars. “You go down the list, they violated every
  goddamn law in the book,” says former Senate investigator Jack Blum, whose
  pursuit of Lockheed in a bribery case led to the passage of the Foreign
  Corrupt Practices Act. “They took in every imaginable form of illegal and
  illicit business.”
