  In another sense, though, the crime occurred nowhere in particular. If a hedge
  fund magnate in Westchester or Long Island sends an email to a bank analyst in

  New York Stock Exchange but retains a major subsidiary in New Jersey, where
  did the offense take place? It depended, entirely, on how you looked at
  things.
