  In criminal law, it covers a mobster who orders a hit but doesn’t pull the
  trigger himself. In civil law, RICO is a perfectly appropriate net for use in
  catching a stock manipulator who hires a thug to depress a company’s share
  price artificially. The problem, however, is the one that confronts financial
  regulators everywhere. Since modern finance is an almost completely global
  enterprise, the major players can make a habit of regulator shopping. A large
  number of financial companies base their trading operations in London, for
  instance, because the regulatory framework there for certain kinds of trades
  (particularly derivative trades) is even weaker than in the United States.
  Other companies place subsidiaries in tax havens or other foreign locales and
  park profits there.
