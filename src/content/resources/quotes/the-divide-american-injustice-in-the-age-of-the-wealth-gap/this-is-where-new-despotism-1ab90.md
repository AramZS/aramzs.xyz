  This is where the new despotism is hidden, in these thousands of arbitrary
  decisions that surround our otherwise transparent system of real jury trials
  and carefully enumerated suspects’ rights. This vast extrademocratic
  mechanism, it turns out, is made up of injustices big and small, from sweeping
  national concepts like Eric Holder’s Collateral Consequences plan, granting
  situational leniency to “systemically important” companies, to smaller, more
  localized outrages like New York City prosecutors subverting speedy trial
  rules in order to extract guilty pleas from poor defendants who can’t make
  bail.
