  The system gives judges the power to make those determinations. But the
  reality is that in the squalid halls of courts like Schermerhorn, impossibly
  high bail is routinely dumped on less-well-off defendants and is just as
  routinely used (in conjunction with tricks like the “certificate of readiness”
  gambit) to pressure those defendants into guilty pleas and other forms of
  cooperation. In the Gen Re case, prosecutors needed the judge to do what
  judges do a million times a day in inner-city courts: stick to the draconian
  book. Instead, he treated the defendants like people deserving of mercy.
