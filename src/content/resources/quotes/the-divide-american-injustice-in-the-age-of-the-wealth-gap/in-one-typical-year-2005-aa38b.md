  In one typical year, in 2005, more than 22,000 people in New York City were
  arrested for loitering. The vast majority of those arrests were dismissed, but
  the original crime in nearly all those cases—refusing to obey an order to
  move—was and is a legal absurdity, creating what one city councilman called an
  “epidemic of false arrest.”
