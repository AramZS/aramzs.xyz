  But now the Latinos, too, are starting to leave, which may be part of a larger
  trend of Latino immigrants returning home as the American economy worsens,
  making the country’s less appealing sides less worth putting up with. In this
  small Georgia community, for instance, the endless roadblocks and car stops
  mean that most local Latino residents get around using an exhausting regime of
  taxis, buses, and bicycles, and the constant harassment wears on them. “People
  are leaving,” says Aaron Rico, Jose’s brother and another Fiesta cabdriver.
  “Go to a city or something. It is getting to be too much.”
