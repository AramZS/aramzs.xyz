  The policing policies that sprang up around these and other theories, and that
  were based upon the idea that crime is encouraged by poor family structure and
  neighborhood disorder, were all about creating an atmosphere that would check
  the unconscious impulse toward crime. Let’s make people actually think before
  they jump a turnstile, and that impulse to think about consequences will be
  nurtured and grow with each arrest, and over time you’ll create a law-abiding
  citizen. It actually sounds good in theory. But there are two big problems
  with it.
