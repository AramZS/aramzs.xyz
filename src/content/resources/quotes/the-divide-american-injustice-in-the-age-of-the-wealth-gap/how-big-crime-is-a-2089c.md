  How big a crime is a $600 million fraud? If one goes by FBI statistics, the
  Gen Re defendants’ fraud cost AIG shareholders more in damages than was stolen
  by all auto thieves in the entire American Northeast in the year 2009, the
  year after the Gen Re defendants’ convictions. Stealing a car in New York is
  grand larceny in the fourth degree and typically carries a sentence of up to
  four years. If the car is worth more, you might get grand larceny in the third
  degree, which takes it up to seven years. A luxury car worth more than $50,000
  might get you as much as fifteen. At the very least, it’s safe to say that a
  lot of car thieves drew a lot more time than the Gen Re defendants. As one
  public defender explained it, “Car thefts, they do those by the book.”
