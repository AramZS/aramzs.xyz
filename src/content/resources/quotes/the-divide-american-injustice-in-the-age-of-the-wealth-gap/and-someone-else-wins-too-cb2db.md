  And someone else wins, too: Wall Street. Some of the biggest investors in
  private prison companies are, you guessed it, the too-big-to-fail banks. Wells
  Fargo, for instance, has nearly $100 million invested in the GEO Group, plus
  about $6 million in CCA. Bank of America, General Electric, Fidelity, and
  Vanguard are all major investors in at least one of the three big prison
  companies. And why not? Like too-big-to-fail banking itself, private prisons
  are an industry that depends not on the unpredictable economy but upon
  political connections. It’s the perfect kind of business in the oligarchical
  capitalism age, with guaranteed profits to provide a low-cost public insurance
  against the vagaries of the market. Stock analysts, naturally, are not blind
  to the brilliance of the business formula.
