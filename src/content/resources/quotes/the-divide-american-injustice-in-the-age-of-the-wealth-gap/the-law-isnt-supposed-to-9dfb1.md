  The law isn’t supposed to be about unspoken excuses and behind-the-scenes
  calculations. The beauty of the system is that judges and juries are allowed
  to consider only what is seen and heard in open court. In between the white
  lines of this arena, it’s all supposed to make sense. This is where we all get
  to be equal again. In the defendant’s chair, rich and poor ride the same
  roller coaster, face the same music. Case has to match case. Sentence should
  match sentence. But they don’t match anymore. They probably never did, and
  probably it was never even close. But at least there was the illusion of it.
  What’s happened now, in this new era of settlements and nonprosecutions, is
  that the state has formally surrendered to its own excuses. It has decided
  just to punt from the start and take the money, which doesn’t become really
  wrong until it turns around the next day and decides to double down on the
  less-defended, flooring it all the way to trial against a welfare mom or some
  joker who sold a brick of dope in the projects. Repeat the same process a few
  million times, and that’s how the jails in America get the population they
  have. Even if every single person they sent to jail were guilty, the system
  would still be an epic fail—
