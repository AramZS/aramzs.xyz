  And in all but a very few of these cases, the narrative is exactly the same.
  There is somehow just enough evidence to extract hundreds of millions or even
  billions of dollars in penalties, but somehow not quite enough evidence to
  force any individual to do so much as a day in jail. Every single time, the
  state lands itself right in that oddly enormous sweet spot between spectacular
  leverage (to extract fines) and no leverage at all (to hand down criminal
  penalties). This makes the “not enough evidence” defense either a total lie or
  the most unbelievable coincidence in history. In one case, maybe. But across
  all these diverse settlements, in so many different types of cases, there’s
  not one case against an individual?
