  For instance, while the San Diego District Attorney’s Office spent more than a
  decade sifting through thousands of dresser drawers and bringing felony cases
  all the way to court for frauds as small as four hundred dollars, executives
  in the same general area of Southern California, at companies like Countrywide
  and Long Beach Mortgage, were pioneering the brilliant mass fraud scheme that
  involved the sales of toxic mortgage-backed securities. One of the favorite
  targets of that fraud scheme was government and the taxpayer. These companies,
  along with their bankers, loved more than anything to sell worthless mortgage
  bonds to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-backed housing agencies.
  Just one Southern Californian company, Countrywide, dumped as much as $26.6
  billion on the taxpayer and the state when it sold overvalued bonds to Fannie
  and Freddie. Bank of America, its eventual parent company, sold another $6
  billion to Fannie and Freddie. Fifteen other companies also targeted the
  federal government for hundreds of millions and billions more. The state of
  California’s pension fund, CalPERS, was also the target of massive fraud
  schemes, as banks, mortgage lenders, and ratings agencies conspired to sell
  California workers billions more in worthless securities in exchange for their
  life savings.
