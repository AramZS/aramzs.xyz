  It also came out during this investigation that Timothy Geithner himself knew
  about some of the LIBOR shenanigans, as far back as 2008. But he did nothing
  about it other than send a letter to the Bank of England with some
  recommendations for how to prevent future manipulations. When asked why he
  didn’t contact the Department of Justice to help it begin a criminal
  investigation, Geithner essentially said that the DOJ had access to the
  information from media reports and didn’t need his help. The primary banking
  regulator in America didn’t contact the Justice Department because he said it
  could read about the case in the newspapers! Forced to answer questions about
  the LIBOR incident in Congress, Geithner was presented with a transcript of
  conversations between a Barclays employee and a Fed official in which the
  Barclays employee admitted to fixing LIBOR rates. “Is there any element of
  criminal fraud that isn’t admitted to in this transcript?” North Carolina
  Democrat Brad Miller asked Geithner, wondering aloud how someone could openly
  admit a crime to a government official, a regulator no less, and not face
  charges for it. Geithner avoided the question, saying that lawyers were
  working on the issue. By then, four years had elapsed since the scandal.
