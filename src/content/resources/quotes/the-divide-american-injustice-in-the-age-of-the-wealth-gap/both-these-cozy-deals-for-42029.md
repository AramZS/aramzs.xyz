  Both of these cozy deals, for Bear and for WaMu, allowed the state to conceal
  massive criminal conspiracies from the public and the markets by burying the
  toxic, fraudulently generated assets of these corrupt companies in the
  billowing skirts of a stable, “reputable,” too-big-to-fail company. In
  exchange, all Chase really had to do was cover up the mess by keeping the
  extent of the fraud and toxicity under wraps.
