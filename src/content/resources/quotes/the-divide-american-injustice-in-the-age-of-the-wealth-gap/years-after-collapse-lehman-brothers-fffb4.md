  Years after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, many of the company’s creditors
  were still feeling the sting. The city of Long Beach, for instance, has been
  enacting sweeping budget cuts ever since the crash. In the first year after
  Lehman’s collapse, the Long Beach school system cut summer school classes and
  bus routes for one thousand students. The city announced plans to lay off
  thirty-four policemen and close at least one fire station. The mayor asked the
  city council to cut all funding for the Long Beach Museum of Art. And the city
  continues to be way behind the financial eight ball. In fact, its projected
  deficit for 2013 almost exactly matches the Lehman shortfall—$20.3 million.
