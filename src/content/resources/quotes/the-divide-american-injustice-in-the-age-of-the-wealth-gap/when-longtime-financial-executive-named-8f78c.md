  When a longtime financial executive named Michael Winston joined Countrywide
  in the mid-2000s, he was startled one day to see a license plate belonging to
  one of the booming mortgage company’s top executives that read “FUND ’EM.”
  When Winston asked the executive what the plate meant, he was told that
  Countrywide’s policy was to give loans to everyone. “But what if the person
  has no job?” Winston asked. “Fund ’em,” the Countrywide executive laughed.
