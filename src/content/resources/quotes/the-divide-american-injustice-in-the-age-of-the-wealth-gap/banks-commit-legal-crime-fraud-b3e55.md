  Banks commit the legal crime of fraud wholesale; they do so out in the open,
  have entire departments committed to it, and have employees who’ve spent years
  literally doing nothing but commit, over and over again, the same legal crime
  that some welfare mothers go to jail for doing once. But they’re not charged,
  because there’s no political crime. The system is not disgusted by the
  organized, mechanized search for profit. It’s more like it’s impressed by it.
  And even when circumstances force the government to take notice, they act like
  Marcia Clark or Chris Darden in summation, apologizing for having the temerity
  to point a finger at lovable ol’ O.J.
