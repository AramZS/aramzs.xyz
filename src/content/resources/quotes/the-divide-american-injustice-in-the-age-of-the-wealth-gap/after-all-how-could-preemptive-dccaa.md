  After all, how could a preemptive search by a law enforcement officer possibly
  be constitutional? Didn’t the state need a warrant, or probable cause, to
  conduct any kind of intrusive search, even of a car—much less someone’s home?
  That was the idea behind Rocio Sanchez et al. v. County of San Diego, a case
  filed with the aid of the local ACLU in 2004. Karen Bjorland, the woman who
  had too many toothbrushes, was one of six litigants in the class-action case.
  You would think this was a slam-dunk civil liberties case, but you’d be wrong.
  In fact, courts have been slowly chipping away at the Fourth Amendment
  protection against unreasonable searches and seizures for a long time, and the
  dominant theme in this gradual legal erosion has been an innovative new form
  of institutional racism, and a creepy inverse correlation between rights and
  need.
