  Nobody laughed at the absurdity of calculating what percentage of a crime took
  place in what state. In my mind, the matter was much simpler: if a crime took
  place in New Jersey at all, be it 7 percent of the overall scheme or 1 percent
  of it, and the ostensible victims lived in New Jersey, then any law officer in
  that state should want to see the local laws applied. Why did it matter if the
  crime also took place in New York, and Toronto, and Australia, and wherever
  else?
