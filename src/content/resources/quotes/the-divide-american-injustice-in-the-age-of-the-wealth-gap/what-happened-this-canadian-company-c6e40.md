  What happened with this Canadian company goes far beyond the merely cynical
  mechanisms of insider trading and market manipulation and takes us down into
  an even darker place in the national psyche, into the netherworld of pure
  violence and aggression that rules modern Wall Street. This is where the drive
  for money and conquest is so intense that it crosses over into a kind of
  hatred and bloodlust, where the payoff stops being about money at all and
  becomes a search for something more desperate and seminal. It’s about winning,
  in the ultimate sense of the word. Not many people in America have the stomach
  to really explore what that term means. But it’s all here in the Fairfax case.
  Thanks to the miracle of legal discovery, which turned this into the most
  extensively documented bear raid in history, we now know the secrets of some
  of America’s biggest winners. Like that they’re crazy.
