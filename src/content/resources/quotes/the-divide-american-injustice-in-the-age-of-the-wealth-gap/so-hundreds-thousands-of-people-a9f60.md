  So hundreds of thousands of people go to jail without committing crimes.
  Thousands or tens of thousands more commit extremely serious crimes, and no
  jail even exists to detain them. There’s a profound story here about what’s
  happening to the very idea of citizenship, be it individual or corporate, in
  the new global economy. It used to be that citizenship in a strong and healthy
  state was universally prized, because citizenship confers rights. But with
  citizenship also comes responsibilities, and it turns out that not everybody
  wants those. In the minds of some, if you can get the rights without the
  responsibilities, you’re really onto something. In other words, there’s a new
  class of people whose goal is to become above citizenship. Live in America,
  conduct your trades in the weaker regulatory arena in London, pay your taxes
  in Antigua or the Isle of Man. Keep the rights but offshore the
  responsibilities.
