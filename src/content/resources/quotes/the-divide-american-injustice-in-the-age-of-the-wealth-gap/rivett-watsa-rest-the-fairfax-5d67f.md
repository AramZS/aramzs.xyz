  Rivett, Watsa, and the rest of the Fairfax executives had no way of knowing it
  at the time, but all this activity had been orchestrated by millionaire and
  billionaire hedge fund managers with bets against Fairfax, men who had gotten
  together and hired the aforementioned shadowy fixer extraordinaire Spyro
  Contogouris to commence a wide-ranging campaign of harassment against the
  firm. A hundred different antagonists with a hundred different names seemed to
  be descending upon the firm from all over the globe, but they were almost
  always just Spyro Contogouris, and a pseudonym, pretending to attack in force.
  The “P. Fate” letter had been written by one of Contogouris’s buddies, and
  Contogouris apparently had also dreamed up the late-night phone calls,
  specifically targeting Watsa’s secretary. The London journalist was
  Contogouris. He was Monty Gardener. He was everybody.
