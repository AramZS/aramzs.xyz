  Wall Street crime, in part, is a confidence game in which the criminal justice
  system itself is the mark. Much like common street grifters, who bank on the
  victim’s feelings of shame and guilt preventing him from going to the police,
  Wall Street criminals bank on the terminal intellectual insecurity of their
  regulators. They dare prosecutors to call what they’ve done crimes, knowing
  they’ll be hesitant to disagree with the hotshot defense lawyers from New York
  and Washington who make forty or fifty times what they do.
