  By the time all these companies were finished first inflating and then
  crashing a huge global asset bubble based on overvalued mortgages, the world
  had lost trillions of dollars—one extremely conservative estimate by the IMF
  put the losses at $4 trillion. But despite having been warned about the
  possibility of widespread mortgage fraud by the FBI as early as 2004,
  financial cops in regulatory agencies like the SEC and the OCC didn’t respond
  to the problem at all until well after the crash. When they finally did
  respond, they did so by bringing civil suits against companies like
  Countrywide, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wachovia, TD Ameritrade, Goldman
  Sachs, Charles Schwab, and others. In the twenty-one biggest federal
  settlements over mortgage fraud abuses—$300 million from State Street for
  lying to investors, $153 million from Chase in the Magnetar settlement, and so
  on—those companies and a few others paid a total of $26 billion in damages to
  the government. In every single one of those cases, the relevant companies
  were allowed to settle without admitting wrongdoing. Not a single individual
  was charged in any of those cases. Not a single individual had to pay so much
  as a dime of his own money in damages.
