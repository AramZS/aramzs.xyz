  For instance, the disparity in arrests of prostitutes versus johns is growing
  all over the country. In Lansing, Michigan, police in the 1990s arrested
  prostitutes and johns in equal numbers. By the early 2000s, it was 3
  prostitutes for every john. It was about 7 to 1 in Chicago, about 9 to 1 in
  Seattle, and in Boston the ratio was 11 to 1.
