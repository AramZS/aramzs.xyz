  “I really am at a loss to figure out why you and the other committee
  professionals are spending so much time on the Barclays sale,” she wrote in an
  email. “What could you or anyone for that matter do even if it turned out that
  the assets turned out to be greater? As you know, the sale has been
  consummated which effectively moots out any relief you might be seeking.” In
  other words, why do you care if the sale was dirty? What’s done is done. Let’s
  not be crying over spilled legal milk, shall we? This is Lehman’s own lawyer
  telling creditors they shouldn’t care if Lehman got ripped off.
