  The Fairfax fiasco is a tale of harassment on a grand scale, in which the
  cream of America’s corporate culture followed executives, burgled information
  from private bank accounts, researched the Canadians’ sexual preferences for
  blackmail purposes, broke into hotel rooms and left threatening messages,
  prank-called a cancer-stricken woman in the middle of the night, and even
  harassed the pastor of the staid Anglican church where the Canadian CEO
  worshipped on Sundays. They worked tirelessly to instigate phony criminal
  investigations in multiple countries, tried relentlessly to scare away
  investors and convince ratings agencies to denounce the firm, and in general
  spread so many lies and false rumors to so many people using so many different
  false names that they needed a spreadsheet to keep track of their aliases.
