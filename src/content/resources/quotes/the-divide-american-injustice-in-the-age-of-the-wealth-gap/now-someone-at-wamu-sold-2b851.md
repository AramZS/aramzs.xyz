  Now, someone at WaMu sold this preposterous loan into a pool of mortgages that
  was bought by investors all around the world. Among the buyers of such loans
  was Stichting Pensioenfonds ABP, a Dutch state pension fund, which ultimately
  sued JPMorgan Chase, which by then had acquired WaMu in a state-aided shotgun
  wedding. The Dutch plaintiffs described the Simpson loan in their suit. That
  same year the fund was forced to cut pensions for some three million workers
  by 0.5 percent. Selling that loan into a securitized pool that would be
  marketed everywhere wasn’t just fraud, it was as bad as grinding horsemeat
  into hot dogs and sending them by the truckload to supermarkets around the
  world. There were tens of thousands of cases just as insidious as the Simpson
  case, and each one of them was a truly despicable criminal fraud. But no
  individuals were ever prosecuted for this kind of crime.
