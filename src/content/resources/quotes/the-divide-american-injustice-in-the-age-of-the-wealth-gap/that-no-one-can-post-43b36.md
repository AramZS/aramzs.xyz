  That no one can post 40 percent returns for fifteen years without cheating is
  blatantly obvious to everyone on Wall Street, but instead of sounding the
  general alarm, the almost universal reaction of the world financial media has
  been to celebrate the genius of such miracle investors with worshipful
  profiles. (At least until Cohen was finally nailed by regulators many years
  after the Fairfax episode.)
