  In any case, shortly after the Stevens case went sideways, Breuer announced a
  plan to revamp the Justice Department’s Criminal Division’s Fraud Section,
  whose chief failing seems to have been that it had been created during the
  Bush administration. In fact, the Fraud Section had been productive during the
  Bush years, expanding its footprint in several areas that had been overlooked,
  from securities fraud to violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act to
  corporate accounting cases from the Enron era. Health care fraud prosecutions
  had gone from basically nil—fraudsters stole from Medicare wantonly in the
  1990s—to thriving, reportedly saving more than $7 billion. But Breuer didn’t
  want the program to continue in its current form.
