  Courts have a great deal of power to strike down programs created by elected
  officials, but little ability to build such programs from the ground up. Thus,
  when an anti-governmental political movement controls the judiciary, it will
  likely be able to exploit that control to great effect. But when a more
  left-leaning movement controls the courts, it is likely to find judicial power
  to be an ineffective tool.
