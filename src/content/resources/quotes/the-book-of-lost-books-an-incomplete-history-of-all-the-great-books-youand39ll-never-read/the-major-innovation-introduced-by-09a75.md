  The major innovation introduced by Aeschylus was the presence of a second
  actor. The effect of this cannot be underestimated: monologue became dialogue,
  and with it the possibility for dramatic conflict, argument, irony, and
  reconciliation arose. It is for this reason Aeschylus is called the father of
  modern drama.
