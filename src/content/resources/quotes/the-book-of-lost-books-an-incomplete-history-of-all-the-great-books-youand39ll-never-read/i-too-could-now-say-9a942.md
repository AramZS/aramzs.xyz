  I too could now say to myself: Be no longer a Chaos, but a World, or even a
  Worldkin. Produce! Produce! Were it but the pitifullest infinitesimal fraction
  of a Product, produce it in God’s name! . . . Up! Up! Whatsoever thy hand
  findeth to do, do it with thy whole might. Work while it is called To-day, for
  the Night cometh wherein no man can work.
