  we also learn that at one point the women of Athens became so frustrated with
  Euripides’ supposedly misogynistic depiction of heroines that they convened a
  meeting to decide upon his punishment. Euripides persuaded his father-in-law,
  Mnelisochus, to attend the assembly, disguised as a woman, to learn what they
  were scheming. On the surface an amusing, if improbable, anecdote, until we
  remember that this is exactly the plot of Aristophanes’ comedy the
  Thesmophoriazusae. The name “Satyrus” may well indicate we should not take the
  text too seriously.
