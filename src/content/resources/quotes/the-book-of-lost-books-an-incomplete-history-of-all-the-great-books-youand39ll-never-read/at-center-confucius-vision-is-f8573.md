  At the center of Confucius’ vision is a concept that defines his difference
  from other epochal figures: jen or “humaneness.” Translating concepts from
  Chinese is a perilous business, and various authors have suggested perfect
  virtue, magnanimity, altruism, and goodness. Confucius, when asked about jen
  by his pupil Fan Ch’ih, defined it as “to love others.” It connotes a virtue
  embedded in being human, which expands to encompass how one should behave
  toward others.
