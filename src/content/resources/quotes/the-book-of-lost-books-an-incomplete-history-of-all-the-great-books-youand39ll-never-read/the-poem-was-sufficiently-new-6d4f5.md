  The poem was sufficiently new and popular that other writers exploited it
  after Chaucer’s death. The “Tale of Beryn” is included in some versions as the
  Merchant’s Tale, and a popular, though anonymous, Canterbury Interlude told of
  the Pardoner’s attempts to seduce a bar-maid, Kit the Tapster, ending in his
  humiliation. The poet John Lydgate, in the fifteenth century, introduced his
  Siege of Thebes with a prologue telling how he met up with the Canterbury
  Pilgrims, who asked him to read his magnum opus. Neither Harry Bailly nor
  Geoffrey Chaucer interrupt the work.
