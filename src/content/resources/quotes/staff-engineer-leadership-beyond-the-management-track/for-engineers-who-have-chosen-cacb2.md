  For engineers who have chosen the “technical leadership” career path, building
  skills can often mean feeling like you’re in the wrong room. As our industry
  matures and tackles ever-bigger problems, more and more companies are
  recognising the need for engineers who have “seen some things” to drive
  technical strategies, lead projects that cross teams and organisations, and
  raise everybody’s game by modeling what good engineering looks like.
