  Knowledge that I might be necessary, but that we shouldn’t be proud that I was
  necessary. That’s how I saw myself and my company by the end of my second
  tour. I didn’t hate what we did so much as hate the need for it all. No one
  should applaud this. We should bow our heads not in thanks but in sadness.
