  The truth is this: in today’s society, computer and video games are fulfilling
  genuine human needs that the real world is currently unable to satisfy. Games
  are providing rewards that reality is not. They are teaching and inspiring and
  engaging us in ways that reality is not. They are bringing us together in ways
  that reality is not.
