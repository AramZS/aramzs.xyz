  introverts in general tend to be more sensitive to external sensory stimulus:
  the cortical region of the brain, which processes the external world of
  objects, spaces, and people, reacts strongly in the presence of any stimulus.
  Extroverts, on the other hand, have lower cortical arousal. They require more
  stimulus to feel engaged with the external world. This makes extroverts more
  likely to seek higher levels of social stimulation, while introverts are more
  likely to feel mentally exhausted after lower levels of social engagement.
