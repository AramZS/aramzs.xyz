  MOTIVATION AND REASONABLY assured progress: this is the start of satisfying
  work. But to be truly satisfied, we have to be able to finish our work as
  clearly as we started it. To finish work in a satisfying way, we must be able
  to see the results of our efforts as directly, immediately, and vividly as
  possible.
