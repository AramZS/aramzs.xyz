  The expertise exchange works just like video game social network profiles that
  advertise what games you’re good at and like to play, as well as the online
  matchmaking systems that help players find new teammates. These systems are
  designed to encourage and facilitate collaboration. By identifying your
  strengths and interests publicly, you increase the chances that you’ll be
  called on to do work that you’re good at. In the classroom, this means
  students are more likely to find ways to contribute successfully to team
  projects. And the chance to do something you’re good at as part of a larger
  project helps students build real esteem among their peers—not empty
  self-esteem
