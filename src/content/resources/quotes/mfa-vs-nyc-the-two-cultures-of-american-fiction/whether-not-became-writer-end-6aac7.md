  whether or not you became a writer, in the end, depended on a lot more than
  talent. Many talented people I knew in college decided to pursue other
  things—they became academics, or screenwriters, or rabbis. Being a writer
  required you to make the decision, over and over and over again, to write. No
  one would care if you stopped doing it, even if they noticed. So there would
  be many moments in the future at which to decide to stop; or to decide not to
  stop, and to keep going.
