  You’ve probably sat through enough management PowerPoint pitches to write it
  yourself: open by defining a problem (the power curve showing the increasing
  frequency of superpowers over time), then introduce an organization to deal
  with the problem. Add a mission statement and an org chart, rhapsodize about
  your agency’s values, describe the future rollout of services, outline a
  protocol whereby your audience may send up the bat-signal to request your
  assistance, and finally thank them for their attention and reassure them that
  as valued stakeholders you welcome their feedback. Credits and curtain call.
