  Cornett engaged legal representation and said she intends to take action
  against McAfee and ESPN, which airs his show, and potentially others involved
  in spreading the rumor. “I would like people to be held accountable for what
  they’ve done,” she said. “You’re ruining my life by talking about it on your
  show for nothing but attention, but here I am staying up until 5 in the

  what’s going to happen for the rest of my life.”
