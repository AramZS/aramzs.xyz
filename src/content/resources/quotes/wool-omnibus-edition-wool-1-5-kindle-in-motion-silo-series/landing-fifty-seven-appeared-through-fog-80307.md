  Landing fifty-seven appeared through the fog of darkness. A young girl sat on
  the steel grate, her feet tucked up against herself, arms wrapped around her
  knees, a children’s book in its protective plastic cover held out into the
  feeble light spilling from an overhead bulb. Jahns watched the girl, who was
  unmoved save her eyes as they darted over the colorful pages. The girl never
  looked up to see who was passing the apartment floor’s landing. They left her
  behind, and she gradually faded in the darkness as Jahns and Marnes struggled
  ever upward, exhausted from their third day of climbing, no vibrations or
  ringing footsteps above or below them, the silo quiet and eerily devoid of
  life, room enough for two old friends, two comrades, to walk side by side on
  the steps of chipping paint, their arms swinging and every now and then, very
  occasionally, brushing together.
