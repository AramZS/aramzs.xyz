  Venkat sees premium mediocrity as a “rational adaptive response” to being
  thrust into insecure economic circumstances, but we have already observed that
  the conditions for an authenticity aesthetic were developing long before the
  financial crisis triggered its eruption. On the other hand I’m reminded of
  Marx’s assertion that everything comes down to economics “in the last
  instance.” Maybe Venkat’s not wrong.
