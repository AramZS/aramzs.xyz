  Shepard Fairey’s commercialization was deemed problematic, yet the same thing
  today would today be considered utterly normal. It seems reasonable to suggest
  that the cultural obsession with authenticity has evaporated entirely. All
  forms of “personal branding” are just one facet of an ethical shift of such
  enormous proportions that it encompasses nearly every major cultural
  development of the last 20 years, and authenticity is at the heart of it.
