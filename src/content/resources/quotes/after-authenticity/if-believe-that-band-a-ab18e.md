  If you believe that a band or a brand can be authentic you probably believe in
  such a thing as an “authentic self” too. It turns out there’s longstanding
  historical precedence for this belief. The origin of the modern authenticity
  drive is the 19th century Romantic movement. The Romantics thought
  intensely-felt emotion was at the heart of beauty and therefore they valued
  the individual experience above all else. They rejected universal ethical
  frameworks and considered individual expression and the development of a
  unique self to be ethically valuable.
