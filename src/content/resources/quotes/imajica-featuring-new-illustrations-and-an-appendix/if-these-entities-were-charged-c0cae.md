  If these entities were charged to keep witnesses from the glacier, they would
  not simply drive the wakeful off but the sleeping too; and those who came as
  he came, in reverence, would earn their special ire. He studied the spattered
  air, looking for some sign of them, and once thought he glimpsed a form
  overhead that would have been invisible but that it displaced the snow: an
  eel’s body with a tiny ball of a head. But it was come and gone too quickly
  for him to be certain he’d even seen it.
