  McGurk warned that because of the president’s lack of planning, the odds were
  high the Kurds would be slaughtered. The SDF might crack apart. ISIS would
  rush back in to wreak havoc on the villages the United States and its partners
  had temporarily turned into peaceful havens. Nobody spoke up to dispute him or
  to counsel against the derisive way he was speaking about Trump. The miliary
  officers in the room looked resigned and defeated, as if mourning the loss of
  something sacred.
