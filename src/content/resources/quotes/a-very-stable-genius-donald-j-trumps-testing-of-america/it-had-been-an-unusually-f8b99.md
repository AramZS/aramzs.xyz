  It had been an unusually acrimonious summit. European allies, including German
  chancellor Angela Merkel, French president Emmanuel Macron, and British prime
  minister Theresa May, were pressing Trump to sign a joint statement committing
  to “a rules-based international order.” The president had resisted, believing
  his counterparts were ganging up on him, before eventually relenting. Then
  Trump put his hand in his suit pocket, took two Starburst candies out, threw
  them on the table in front of Merkel, and said, “Here, Angela. Don’t say I
  never give you anything,”
