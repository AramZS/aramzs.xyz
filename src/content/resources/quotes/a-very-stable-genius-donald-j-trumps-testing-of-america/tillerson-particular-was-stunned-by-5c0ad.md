  Tillerson in particular was stunned by Trump’s diatribe and began visibly
  seething. For too many minutes, others in the room noticed, he had been
  staring straight, dumbfounded, at Mattis, who was speechless, his head bowed
  down toward the table. Tillerson thought to himself, “Gosh darn it, Jim, say
  something. Why aren’t you saying something?” But, as he would later tell close
  aides, Tillerson realized in that moment that Mattis was genetically a marine,
  unable to talk back to his commander in chief, no matter what nonsense came
  out of his mouth.
