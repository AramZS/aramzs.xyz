  May was calling Trump to congratulate him on his party’s successes in the
  midterm elections. Of course, it was not lost on her that the Republicans lost
  control of the House, but she nevertheless sought to appeal to Trump’s ego. It
  did not work. The ornery president blew up at the mannered prime minister.
  Trump berated May over Brexit and told her she was a lousy negotiator. He lit
  into her about trade deals with European countries that he considered unfair
  to the United States. It felt like a one-way conversation, with Trump doing
  most of the talking. Then, suddenly, he changed the topic and told her she
  must not have brought up Iran because she was ashamed of Britain’s position.
  In fact, she hadn’t raised Iran because it wasn’t a scheduled topic of
  conversation—and besides, she could hardly get a word in.
