  The White House abruptly banned Lemire and three other U.S. journalists from
  covering Trump’s dinner with Kim shortly thereafter, where the leaders tried
  to bond over grilled sirloin and chocolate lava cake. This was an
  extraordinary act of retaliation by the U.S. government, which had
  historically upheld the rights of journalists whenever a president traveled
  overseas, and especially in the presence of autocrats whose countries do not
  have a free press.
