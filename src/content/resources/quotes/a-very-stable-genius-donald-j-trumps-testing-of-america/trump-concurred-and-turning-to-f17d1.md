  Trump concurred and, turning to Nielsen at the far end of the table, asked,
  “Why haven’t you shut down the border?” It was more of an admonition than a
  question. Nielsen knew this would be illegal, not to mention economically
  disastrous because it could choke off trade routes. “I’m not sure what we are
  saying here,” Nielsen said. “As the attorney general knows, people have a
  legal right to cross the border and try to claim asylum. That’s just the law.”
  Trump looked back at Sessions. “No,” Sessions said, “we should just shut the
  border down.” Trump then lit into Nielsen.
