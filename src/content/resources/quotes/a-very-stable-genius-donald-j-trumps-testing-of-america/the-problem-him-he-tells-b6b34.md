  “The problem with him: he tells you what he thinks he knows or what he thinks
  he remembers,” said one adviser. “He might actually believe it. And he may not
  think he is lying. When you confront him and say, but no, ‘Remember this
  fact?’ He’ll say, ‘That’s right.’ He’ll work closer to the truth. It’s not an
  inattention to the detail. It’s his feeling that the details and pieces are
  irrelevant. He’s a big-picture, broad-point guy. He says, ‘Hey, I know this
  big point is true. Who cares about the other stuff?’”
