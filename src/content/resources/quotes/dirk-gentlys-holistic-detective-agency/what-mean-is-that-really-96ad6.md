  “What I mean is that if you really want to understand something, the best way
  is to try and explain it to someone else. That forces you to sort it out in
  your own mind. And the more slow and dim-witted your pupil, the more you have
  to break things down into more and more simple ideas. And that’s really the
  essence of programming. By the time you’ve sorted out a complicated idea into
  little steps that even a stupid machine can deal with, you’ve certainly
  learned something about it yourself.
