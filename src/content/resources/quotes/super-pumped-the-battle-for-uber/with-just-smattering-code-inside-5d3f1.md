  With just a smattering of code inside Uber’s mobile app, InAuth could track
  down the device identification number of the iPhone used to install the app, a
  technique known as “fingerprinting” in the security and fraud industry. Once a
  phone was “fingerprinted,” it was much easier for Uber to tell if it was being
  used for fraud. Just a few months after starting at Uber, Quentin signed a
  contract with InAuth.
