  Sagar Shah, Uber’s local general manager, called local television news
  stations and print reporters to the MTC offices, where a line of Uber
  employees marched up with nine white, 15-by-12-inch file-folder storage boxes
  labeled “1,000 PETITIONS.” After stacking the boxes high against the front
  door of the MTC, Shah delivered a short, lofty speech on democratic ideals and
  “listening to the voices” of the people supporting Uber. After the cameras
  were turned off and Uber officials had left the scene, a reporter decided to
  look inside one of the boxes the company had left. It was filled with
  six-packs of plastic seventeen-ounce water bottles, as were the eight other
  boxes that accompanied it.
