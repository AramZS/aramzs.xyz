  As chief technology officer of Uber, Pham was responsible for the entire
  engineering corps inside of Uber, a sprawling organization of hundreds of
  brilliant young hackers. Pham’s team looked up to him; a disciplined executive
  with dark hair, bronzed skin, and square, gunmetal-colored glasses that cut a
  sharp contrast to his smile. To many of his engineers, he was a rare breed of
  CTO: empathetic to his staff and even emotional when dealing with tough
  company issues. His workers repaid him with their loyalty. Most of all, they
  respected his work ethic, especially his ability to respond to subordinates’
  emails at all hours of the day. Even when he took a vacation, Pham had his
  laptop open at the airport, answering emails on the runway up until the moment
  the flight attendant told him it was time to stow his electronic devices.
