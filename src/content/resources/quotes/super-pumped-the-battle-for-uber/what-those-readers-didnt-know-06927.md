  What those readers didn’t know was that the armchair hacker had stumbled upon
  the secret InAuth code library, written inside of the Uber app as part of
  their secret deal. In order to fingerprint devices, InAuth required far more
  data than the average smartphone app, which meant asking for all sort of
  extended permissions. InAuth created device profiles based on this data to
  triangulate the users’ IMEI numbers. It was a clever technique, and companies
  besides Uber paid millions to use it. But the practice upset consumers when
  they discovered how much information they had unknowingly given Uber.
