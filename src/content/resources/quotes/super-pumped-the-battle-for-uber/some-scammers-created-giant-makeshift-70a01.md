  Some scammers created giant makeshift circuit boards filled with hundreds of
  slots to insert SIM cards, the small microchips that allow mobile phones to
  communicate with a cellular network. Each SIM card in the circuit board acted
  as a new number that could automatically respond to a verification text for a
  newly created account, which the scammers then used to rack up more fake rides
  and bonuses. After the SIMs had been used, a scam artist replaced all the SIMs
  on the board with a fresh set of numbers and started the process all over
  again. Have hundreds or even thousands of “drivers” repeat that dozens of
  times per day, seven days a week, and it amounted to serious Uber losses.
