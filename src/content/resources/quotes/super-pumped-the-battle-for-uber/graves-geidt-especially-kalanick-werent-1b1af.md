  Graves, Geidt, and especially Kalanick weren’t above playing dirty. They
  started booking secret meetings with regulators in San Francisco and
  encouraging them to go after Lyft and Sidecar. Where once Uber had scoffed at
  City Hall, now they implored city officials to shut the other companies down.
  “They’re breaking the law!” Geidt and Graves said to the indifferent
  regulators. Though Sunil Paul’s efforts with Sidecar weren’t taking off, Lyft
  was gaining traction quickly. People loved the stupid pink mustaches.
