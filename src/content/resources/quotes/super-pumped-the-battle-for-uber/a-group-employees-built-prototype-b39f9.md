  a group of employees built a prototype Uber driver app that repurposed certain
  parts of a driver’s smartphone—specifically, the accelerometer and
  gyroscope—to detect the sound of notifications that came from the Lyft app. If
  Uber knew that a driver worked for Lyft, Uber could market itself differently
  to the driver—likely with cash bonuses—to entice them away from the pink
  moustache.
