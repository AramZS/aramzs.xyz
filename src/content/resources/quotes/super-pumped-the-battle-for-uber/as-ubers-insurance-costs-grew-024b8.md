  As Uber’s insurance costs grew exponentially, the “Safe Rides Fee” was devised
  to add $1 of pure margin to each trip, according to employees who worked on
  the addition. That meant for each trip taken in the United States, Uber took
  in an extra dollar in cash. The drivers, of course, got no share of the extra
  buck. That number added up to hundreds of millions of dollars over years of
  operation, a sizeable new line of income. After the money was collected it was
  never earmarked specifically for improving safety.
