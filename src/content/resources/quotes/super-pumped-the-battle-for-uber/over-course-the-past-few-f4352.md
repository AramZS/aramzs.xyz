  Over the course of the past few months, Uber employees had begun failing the
  Bay Area cocktail party test. For employees, Uber had become a scarlet letter.
  Where once wearing Uber black had been a point of pride—like Facebook
  blue—now, admitting you worked at 1455 Market Street immediately
  short-circuited a conversation and drew strange looks. Implicit was the
  question, “How can you work for Uber?” It didn’t feel good. And people started
  quitting.
