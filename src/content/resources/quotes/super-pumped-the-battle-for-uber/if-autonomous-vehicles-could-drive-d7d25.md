  If the autonomous vehicles could drive themselves, Kalanick mused, they could
  create a “Super Duper” version of Uber, or “Uber Super Duper.” Instead of
  taking 30 percent of driver earnings—the company’s current business model—Uber
  would instead take the entire fare. That meant billions upon billions more in
  revenue. The abbreviation, USD, lent itself to a cool internal codename: “$,”
  a simple dollar sign.
