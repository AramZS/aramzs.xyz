  In 2004, when Google undertook its IPO, it used a controversial financial
  instrument called a “dual-class stock structure.” Google sold “Class A” shares
  to the public, while its founders held onto “Class B” shares. The two classes
  held the same monetary value, but Class B shares came with special privileges;
  every Class B share represented ten “votes,” or ten individual chances to yea
  or nay company leadership decisions.
