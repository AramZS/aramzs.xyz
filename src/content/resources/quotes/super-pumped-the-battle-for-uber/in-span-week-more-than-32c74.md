  In the span of a week, more than 500,000 people deleted their Uber accounts
  entirely, not counting the incalculable others who simply deleted the app from
  their phones. Uber’s all-important ridership growth curves—for years always
  hockey-sticking up and to the right—started turning downward. Kalanick began
  to sweat.
