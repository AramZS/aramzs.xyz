  Cohler’s brinksmanship dismayed almost everyone in the room. Instead of
  following a fair process to determine the best candidate, Benchmark was
  effectively holding the board hostage to approve the candidate of their
  choice. Cohler’s speech may have cost Whitman the job. After the next secret
  ballot, the votes came in again, but this time it was not deadlocked. It was
  five to three in favor of Khosrowshahi. The group had chosen Uber’s next CEO.
