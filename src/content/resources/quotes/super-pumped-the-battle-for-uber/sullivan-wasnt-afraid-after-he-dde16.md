  Sullivan wasn’t afraid. After he and his colleagues took down one of the
  biggest Romanian eBay fraud rings, eBay flew him to Bucharest to testify in
  court—at his own request. As Sullivan took the stand, he was flanked by two
  beefy local police guards. Each of them held an AK-47 and wore a jet-black
  balaclava—a woolen mask that fully covered the face—for fear they would be
  identified and later killed by the local mafia after the trial. Sullivan,
  donning his old uniform of suit and tie, delivered hours of testimony that
  helped put the fraudsters behind bars. He didn’t wear a mask.
