  With the report came a series of recommendations from Holder and partner Tammy
  Albarrán. The final list would span a dozen pages and include a number of
  serious structural alterations, and different versions of the recommendations
  would later be distributed. But Holder and Albarrán had put their most
  important action items at the top: Travis Kalanick needed to take a leave of
  absence from his own company, relinquish his control of Uber’s business, and
  hire a proper chief operating officer to help him do so.
