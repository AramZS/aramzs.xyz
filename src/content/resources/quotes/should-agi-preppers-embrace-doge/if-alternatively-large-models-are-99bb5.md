  If, alternatively, large models are not the near-term harbingers of AGI, but
  social and cultural technologies, then DOGE style changes are plausibly a
  horrific mistake. We are lobotomizing government, and ripping out the funding
  structures that support key forms of basic and applied scientific research
  without any plausible replacement. The short, medium and long term
  consequences are likely to be terrible, unless these changes are reversed
  quickly.

  Under this perspective, there is indeed likely to be value in adopting large
  models, but doing it well will require complex and careful reform. Government
  is not an obsolescent institution that can largely be substituted by AI
  awesome, but there are ways in which we can use these technologies to make
  government work better
