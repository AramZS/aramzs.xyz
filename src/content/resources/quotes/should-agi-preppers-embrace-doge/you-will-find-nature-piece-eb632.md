  you will find a Nature piece reporting on a recent survey of members of the
  Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence, where 84% of
  respondents say that the neural net architectures that large models rely on
  are “insufficient to achieve AGI” on their own. Such views - which are common
  in my experience talking to Johns Hopkins colleagues who work on these
  technologies - are not nearly as colorful as speculation about imminent AGI,
  do not get nearly as much attention in places like the New York Times, but do
  suggest that the claims of grand changes real soon are so much whistling past
  the graveyard
