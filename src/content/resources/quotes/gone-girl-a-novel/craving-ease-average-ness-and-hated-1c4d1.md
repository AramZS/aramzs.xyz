  craving ease and average-ness, and I hated myself for it, and ultimately, I
  realized, I punished her for it. I turned her into the brittle, prickly thing
  she became. I had pretended to be one kind of man and revealed myself to be
  quite another. Worse, I convinced myself our tragedy was entirely her making.
  I spent years working myself into the very thing I swore she was: a righteous
  ball of hate.
