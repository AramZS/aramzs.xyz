  If one skel broke the rules, there were more. It was survivor’s logic: If Mark
  Spitz was alive, there had to be others. Until the day it was not true. The
  fortune-teller must be a mistake, an errant bad comet loping into their solar
  system, the malfunctioning one percent of the malfunctioning one percent. Or
  else the world was resuming its decomp after these months of tenuous
  integrity, those stalwart membranes and harassed cell walls finally dissolving
  into a black spume. “Where’s Tammy?”
