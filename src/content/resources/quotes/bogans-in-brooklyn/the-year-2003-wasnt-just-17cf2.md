  The year 2003 wasn’t just when an Australian beachhead was established in
  downtown Manhattan, though. It was also when the United States invaded Iraq.
  The war was not popular with many of our allies, like the French, who had
  their heads screwed on right for once and told President George W. Bush to get
  lost. Not Australian Prime Minister John Howard, though. He was playing the
  long game. He knew he could take over Madison Avenue and get Americans hooked
  on flat whites, so he agreed to join the U.S.-led coalition, sending around
  two thousand troops to Iraq. This partnership, along with the United
  States-Australia Free Trade Agreement, is widely believed to have led to the
  creation of the E-3 visa
