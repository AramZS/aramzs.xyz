  The easiest way to do this is to take unique strings from each of the major
  content pages on the site and search on them in Google. Make sure you enclose
  the string inside double quotes (e.g., “a phrase from your website that you
  are using to check for duplicate content”) so that Google will search for that
  exact string.
