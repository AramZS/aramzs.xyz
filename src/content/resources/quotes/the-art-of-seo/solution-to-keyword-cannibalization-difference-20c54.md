  Solution to keyword cannibalization The difference in this example is that
  instead of every page targeting the single term snowboards, the pages are
  focused on unique, valuable variations and all of them link back to an
  original, canonical source for the single term. Google can now easily identify
  the most relevant page for each of these queries.
