  The solution is simple, at least in principle: have the link-rich pages spread
  the wealth to their link-bereft brethren. As easy as this may sound, in
  execution it can be incredibly complex. Inside the architecture of a site with
  several hundred thousand or a million pages, it can be nearly impossible to
  identify link-rich and link-poor pages, never mind adding code that helps to
  distribute link juice equitably.
