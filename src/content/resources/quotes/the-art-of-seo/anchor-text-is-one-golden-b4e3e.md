  Anchor text is one of the golden opportunities of internal linking. As an SEO
  practitioner, you need to have in your plan from the very beginning a way to
  use keyword-rich anchor text in your internal links. Avoid using text such as
  “More” or “Click here,” and make sure the technical and creative teams
  understand this.
