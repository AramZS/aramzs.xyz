  DMOZ (Open Directory) listings for your site. In this case, the search engines
  may choose to use a title for your page that was used in your listings in this
  directory, instead of the title tag on the page. There is a meta tag that
  allows you to block this from happening: the NOODP tag, which tells the search
  engine not to use DMOZ titles.
