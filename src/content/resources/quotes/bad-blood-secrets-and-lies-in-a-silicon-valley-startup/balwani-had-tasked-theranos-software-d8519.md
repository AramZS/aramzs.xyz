  Balwani had tasked a Theranos software engineer named Michael Craig to write
  an application for the miniLab’s software that masked test malfunctions. When
  something went wrong inside the machine, the app kicked in and prevented an
  error message from appearing on the digital display. Instead, the screen
  showed the test’s progress slowing to a crawl.
