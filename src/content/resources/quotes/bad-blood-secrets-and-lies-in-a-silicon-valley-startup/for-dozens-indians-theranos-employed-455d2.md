  For the dozens of Indians Theranos employed, the fear of being fired was more
  than just the dread of losing a paycheck. Most were on H-1B visas and
  dependent on their continued employment at the company to remain in the
  country. With a despotic boss like Sunny holding their fates in his hands, it
  was akin to indentured servitude.
