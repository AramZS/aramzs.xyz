  In late September, as we were getting close to publication, Holmes met with
  Murdoch a fourth time in his office on the eighth floor of the News
  Corporation building in Midtown Manhattan. My desk in the Journal’s newsroom
  was just three floors below, but I had no idea she was on the premises. She
  brought up my story with renewed urgency, hoping Murdoch would offer to kill
  it. Once again, despite the substantial investment he had at stake, he
  declined to intervene.
