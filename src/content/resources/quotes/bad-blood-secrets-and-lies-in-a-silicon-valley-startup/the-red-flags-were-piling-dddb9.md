  The red flags were piling up. First, Elizabeth had denied him access to their
  lab. Then she’d rejected his proposal to embed someone with them in Palo Alto.
  And now she was refusing to do a simple comparison study. To top it all off,
  Theranos had drawn the blood of the president of Walgreens’s pharmacy
  business, one of the company’s most senior executives, and failed to give him
  a test result! Van den Hooff listened with a pained look on his face. “We
  can’t not pursue this,” he said. “We can’t risk a scenario where CVS has a
  deal with them in six months and it ends up being real.” Walgreens’s rivalry
  with CVS, which was based in Rhode Island and one-third bigger in terms of
  revenues, colored virtually everything the drugstore chain did. It was a
  myopic view of the world that was hard to understand for an outsider like
  Hunter who wasn’t a Walgreens company man. Theranos had cleverly played on
  this insecurity. As a result, Walgreens suffered from a severe case of
  FoMO—the fear of missing out.
