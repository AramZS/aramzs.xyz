  Sure, Mark Zuckerberg had learned to code on his father’s computer when he was
  ten, but medicine was different: it wasn’t something you could teach yourself
  in the basement of your house. You needed years of formal training and decades
  of research to add value. There was a reason many Nobel laureates in medicine
  were in their sixties when their achievements were recognized.
