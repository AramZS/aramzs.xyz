  Such overpromising became a defining feature of Silicon Valley. The harm done
  to consumers was minor, measured in frustration and deflated expectations. By
  positioning Theranos as a tech company in the heart of the Valley, Holmes
  channeled this fake-it-until-you-make-it culture, and she went to extreme
  lengths to hide the fakery. Many companies in Silicon Valley make their
  employees sign nondisclosure agreements, but at Theranos the obsession with
  secrecy reached a whole different level.
