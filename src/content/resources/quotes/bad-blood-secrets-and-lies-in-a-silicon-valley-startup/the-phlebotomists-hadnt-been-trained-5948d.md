  The phlebotomists hadn’t been trained to use the centrifuge they’d been given
  and didn’t know how long or at what speed to spin down patients’ blood. When
  they arrived in Palo Alto, the plasma samples were often polluted with
  particulate matter. She also discovered that many of the blood-drawing tubes
  Theranos was using were expired, making the anticoagulant in them ineffective
  and compromising the integrity of the specimens.
