  Walgreens, which had sunk a total of $140 million into Theranos, filed its own
  lawsuit against the company, accusing it of failing to meet the “most basic
  quality standards and legal requirements” of the companies’ contract. “The
  fundamental premise of the parties’ contract—like any endeavor involving human
  health—was to help people, and not to harm them,” the drugstore chain wrote in
  its complaint.
