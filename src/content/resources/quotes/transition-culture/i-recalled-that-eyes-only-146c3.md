  I recalled that the eyes only see by moving; we can fasten our gaze on
  something and stare intently at it only because our eyes are consumed with
  dozens of tiny involuntary movements each second. Hold something perfectly and
  genuinely still in our field of vision and that very fixity makes it
  disappear.
