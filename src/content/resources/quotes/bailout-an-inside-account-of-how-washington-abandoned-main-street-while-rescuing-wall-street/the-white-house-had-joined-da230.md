  the White House had joined the fray. It posted on its website and blasted out
  to the press an article full of mischaracterizations and inaccuracies entitled
  “The Facts of AIG,” written by deputy White House communications director Jen
  Psaki. Psaki savaged me in the post, saying that I was trying “to generate a
  false controversy over AIG to try and grab a few, cheap headlines” and was
  “stuck in a time warp.” Suggesting that I had an anti–White House bias, Psaki
  also questioned my independence, stating “Any truly independent observer would
  say that Treasury’s stake in AIG will be worth more than taxpayers originally
  invested in that company.”12 She even suggested that I didn’t “like movies
  with happy endings.”
