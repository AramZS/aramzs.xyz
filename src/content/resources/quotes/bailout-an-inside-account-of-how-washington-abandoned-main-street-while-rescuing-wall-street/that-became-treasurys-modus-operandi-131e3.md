  That became Treasury’s modus operandi: first, announcements intended to “shock
  and awe” the media that made for good sound bites but were not particularly
  well thought out; then, weeks later, scattered and incomplete details that had
  to be reworked on the fly. And finally, poor program execution that
  accomplished little, if any, of the originally announced goals. Several of the
  programs announced that day followed the pattern exactly.
