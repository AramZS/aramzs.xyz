  That is the crux of the too-big-to-fail problem. The failure of giant
  financial institutions that are so big and have built up so many obligations
  to one another could cause a domino effect that could take down other major
  players and eventually the entire financial system. If the government had not
  stepped in to save AIG, major banks in the United States and Europe would have
  potentially suffered tens of billions of dollars of losses at a time when
  neither they nor the system could withstand such a further shock. The
  government felt it had no choice, and perhaps that was correct, but as long as
  there are financial institutions of such size and with so many
  interconnections, future massive crises—and bailouts—are all but inevitable.
