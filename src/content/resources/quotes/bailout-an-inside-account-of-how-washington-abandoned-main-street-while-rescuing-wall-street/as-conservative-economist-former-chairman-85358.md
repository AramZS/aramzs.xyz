  As the conservative economist and former chairman of President Reagan’s
  Council of Economic Advisers Martin Feldstein later argued in a New York Times
  editorial, the large number of underwater mortgages slowed recovery by
  increasing the risk of borrowers defaulting on their mortgages, inhibiting the
  necessary increases in consumer spending, preventing workers from moving to
  areas where there were greater employment opportunities, and restricting the
  ability of individuals to tap home equity to start up and expand businesses.
