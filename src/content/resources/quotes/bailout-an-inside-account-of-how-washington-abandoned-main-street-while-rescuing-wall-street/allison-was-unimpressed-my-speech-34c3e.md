  Allison was unimpressed with my speech. Not that I can blame him—I’m sure it
  sounded like a sound bite devised for a press interview. He continued, “You
  have to think about it. And I’m telling you, you’re doing yourself real harm.
  Out there in the market, there are consequences for some of the things that
  you’re saying and the way that you’re saying them.” I was impressed with
  Allison’s approach. By that point I’d been in Washington long enough to know
  when I was being played, and Allison was essentially threatening me with
  lifelong unemployment. But, to his credit, his tone dripped with sincerity.
