  “The hearings, they’re gone. The Democrats have canceled both hearings for
  next week,” Lori said. “Both? Why? What did they say?” I asked. “Nothing. The
  official word from the committee is that there is no explanation. But I did
  some digging,” Lori said. “Treasury!” I said. “Treasury got them to cancel?” I
  asked. Lori looked at me pitifully. “No, not Treasury, they don’t have that
  type of influence. Nobody came right out and said it, but the suggestion was
  that this came from the White House. I got the impression that someone high up
  in the White House doesn’t want SIGTARP on the Hill next week.”
