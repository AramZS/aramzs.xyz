  In other words, the lenders were paying brokers to steer unsuspecting
  borrowers into more expensive loans that they had less of a chance of being
  able to repay. From the lenders’ perspective the economics were simple:
  because of higher interest rates and fees on subprime loans, they could resell
  them for a higher profit than they would earn on prime loans, and so were
  willing to pay brokers to generate more. The worse the mortgage was for the
  borrower, the more profitable it was in the short term for everyone else. As
  for the regulators, particularly the Federal Reserve, they had more or less
  abandoned any semblance of consumer protection during this time period and
  looked the other way at reported instances of predatory lending.
