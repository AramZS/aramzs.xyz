  In that respect, Geithner’s opening of the spigot of taxpayer cash for AIG was
  more of a bailout of the banks than it was for AIG itself. The government
  thereby sent Wall Street a very dangerous message: counterparties who do
  business with financial institutions whose collapse could have devastating
  consequences for the entire financial system needn’t do due diligence or worry
  about their counterparty risk. Instead, they can rely on the government to
  bail them out.
