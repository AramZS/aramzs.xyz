  We had a second chance to fix the system in 2010 by breaking up the largest
  banks through regulatory reform, but the banks—with a healthy assist from
  Geithner and the Treasury Department—won that battle too. And we had an
  election in 2012 that could also have been an opportunity for meaningful
  change. But both candidates staunchly defended the status quo, which
  maintained the size and power of the banks, even as they made the incredible
  claim that they would never bail them out again. I fear that we may not have
  many more opportunities left before it is too late, and that meaningful reform
  will arise only out of the ashes of the next economic conflagration.
