  Worse still, the presumption of bailout made the banks more attractive to
  creditors, who continued to extend credit at prices that did not fully account
  for the risks that the banks were taking and, as a result, failed to provide
  the necessary market discipline to rein in excessive risk-taking. This “heads
  I win; tails the Government will bail me out” incentive system was still
  firmly in place.
