  “Total government commitment, it’s $23.7 trillion.” I really didn’t believe
  the figure until I saw the backup documents that had been provided by each of
  the agencies themselves. This total commitment was almost double the entire
  annual economic output of the United States. If there were ever a single
  number that demonstrated the panic felt by the regulators during the financial
  crisis, it was that $23.7 trillion.
