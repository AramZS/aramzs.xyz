  It was not the first time I’d been asked that question in Washington. It’s the
  question that everyone asks, always to themselves and sometimes to others.
  What’s next? What’s your angle? What’s going to be the payout? How are you
  going to leverage your current position to get a better one with more power
  and a bigger payout?
