  After all, Paulson and Geithner hadn’t just saved the banks, they’d also
  preserved a status quo that was dangerously broken, and in so doing they might
  have actually increased the danger lurking in our financial architecture. For
  example, by encouraging the largest banks to acquire one another, they had
  made the too-big-to-fail banks even bigger, with the top five bank holding
  companies more than 20 percent larger in terms of assets than they had been
  before the crisis.
