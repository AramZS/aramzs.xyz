  the sloppy reality of a hamburger doesn’t matter. The plastic model shown in
  commercials is what’s primary. It’s designed to represent a hamburger and to
  look delicious, even if it’s actually a plastic concoction that might kill you
  to eat. The “actual” hamburger might look unappealing, or even barely edible.
  But that’s not really what we’re buying. We’re buying the illusion, the idea
  that we’re participating in those images of smiling people gobbling a
  luscious, perfect burger – even if what we’re actually getting is a cheap
  action figure that looks little like the character it theoretically
  represents.
