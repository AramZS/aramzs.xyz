  The super-hero is something that I think people struggle to make intensely
  apolitical. But it cannot help but be political, because the classical role of
  the super-hero is constantly to return to the status quo. The super-hero
  cannot help but be a figure for conservatism. Grant [Morrison] will tell you
  that Superman is an aspirational figure. But the fact is one cannot aspire to
  be Superman, because one was not born on a different planet with all these
  innate genetic privileges. A super-hero should be an aspirational figure.
  Batman could be an aspirational figure. Except, of course, you know, Batman is
  mad. They are, in fact, conservative figures.
