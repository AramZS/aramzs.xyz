  Anyone who has visited a major city – or used the internet – has likely lost
  count of the advertisements bombarding them. The effect can be bewildering. We
  can feel at odds with the products thrusting themselves into our view – and
  thus at odds with our own culture, which presumes these products would appeal
  to us. The only way to cope with this inundation too often seems to be apathy
  – to not look, or to stop noticing or caring.
