  Of course, this is a very real-world concern: some poor neighborhoods in the
  United States, currently the richest and most powerful nation in the world,
  have life expectancies and infant mortality rates rivaling third-world
  nations. There’s no reason this has to be so, except that we wish it to be so
  – or simply don’t care. If the real horror is what humans do to each other,
  the real tragedy is that enough of us have “give[n] up and let it happen.”
