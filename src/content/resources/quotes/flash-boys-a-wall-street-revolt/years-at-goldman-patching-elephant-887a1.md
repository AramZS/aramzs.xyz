  years at Goldman, patching the elephant. For their patching material he and
  the other Goldman programmers resorted, every day, to open source
  software—software developed by collectives of programmers and made freely
  available on the Internet. The tools and components they used were not
  specifically designed for financial markets, but they could be adapted to
  repair Goldman’s plumbing. He discovered, to his surprise, that Goldman had a
  one-way relationship with open source. They took huge amounts of free software
  off the Web, but they did not return it after he had modified it, even when
  his modifications were very slight and of general, rather than financial, use.
