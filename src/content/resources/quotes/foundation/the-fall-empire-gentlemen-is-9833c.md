  The fall of Empire, gentlemen, is a massive thing, however, and not easily
  fought. It is dictated by a rising bureaucracy, a receding initiative, a
  freezing of caste, a damming of curiosity—a hundred other factors. It has been
  going on, as I have said, for centuries, and it is too majestic and massive a
  movement to stop.
