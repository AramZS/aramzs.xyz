  When a woman, any woman, has issues with substances or has kids out of
  wedlock, and ends up struggling as a single parent, she is identified by many
  names: slut, loser, welfare mom, a burden on society. Take those same
  circumstances and array them over a male, and he becomes a crown prince. See
  the lone white male doing that dad thing and, with a flick of the wrist, the
  mom thing too! (I found out later that regardless of that conceit, I was not
  Erin’s and Meagan’s mom. Their mom was their mom.) Why is it that the same
  series of overt acts becomes somehow ennobled by gender?
