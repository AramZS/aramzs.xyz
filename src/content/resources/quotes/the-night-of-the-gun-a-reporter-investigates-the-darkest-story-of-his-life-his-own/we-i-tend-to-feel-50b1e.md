  We, I, you tend to feel unworthy of some of the blessings that come our way,
  perhaps because, in our darker moments, it is so much more than we think we
  deserve. If that seems a bit ardent, a flourish of therapy-speak in what is a
  fairly black-and-white matter—there are some people, millions, in fact, who
  should not use mood-altering chemicals—how else to explain the very common
  story of relapse among people who have a decade or more of sobriety? Perhaps
  it has less to do with Freudian imperatives and is more as simple as the fact
  that human beings have a tendency to forget.
