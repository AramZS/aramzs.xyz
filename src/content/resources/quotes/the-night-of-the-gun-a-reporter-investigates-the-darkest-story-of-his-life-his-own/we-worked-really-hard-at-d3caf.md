  we worked really hard at CP because you had that ineffable effect on a room.
  That energy that good and dangerous leaders give off. That kind of aura that
  makes you want to please them, even when you’re not sure why. I don’t know
  what that comes from. Partly passion for the job, partly credibility. But some
  part of it you’re born with. And you have it. I’d say ninety-nine percent of
  managers don’t have it.”
