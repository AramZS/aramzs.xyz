  Despite having a partnership with the Texas Tribune, Perplexity cited an
  unofficial version of the article instead.


  Conversely, syndicated versions or unauthorized copies of news articles
  present a challenge for publishers wishing to opt out of crawling. Their
  content continued to appear in results without their consent, albeit
  incorrectly attributed to the sources that republished it. For instance, while
  USA Today blocks ChatGPT’s crawler, the chatbot still cited a version of its
  article that was republished by Yahoo News.
