  But in order to get into a top university, and pass the bar exam, I had to
  study like mad, just like Tengo and Aomame. I had no time to have fun like my
  classmates. I had to abstain from all worldly pleasures—not that I had much
  chance of obtaining them to begin with—and focus solely on my studies. I was
  always stuck between feelings of inferiority and superiority.
