  When things are at their most stressful, when my circumstances are at their most deficient, this is when I derive the most pleasure from a game like Diablo IV. I do not want to think, I do not want to perceive the cage or the laboratory. I want to click the button and receive my little treats. What is most predatory about the monetization schemes of Diablo is that they are designed to meet a person right exactly there. At the moment where they are at their lowest. At the moment they crave that little treat the most.
