  TV: Do you ever feel scared? He's the richest man in the world.VW: He's a
  pathetic man-child. Why would I feel scared of him? Ohhh, he has so much
  power. Nah, nah, nah. I don't give a f**k. Why should I be scared of this man?
  Because he's rich? Oh, no, I'm trembling. Ooh, shivering in my boots here. I
  don't give a f**k how much money anyone has. I don't. I really don't. He owns
  Twitter. Okay. Congratulations.People thrive off of fear. I'm not giving
  anyone that space in my mind. The only thing that gets to live free in my mind
  are drag queens.
