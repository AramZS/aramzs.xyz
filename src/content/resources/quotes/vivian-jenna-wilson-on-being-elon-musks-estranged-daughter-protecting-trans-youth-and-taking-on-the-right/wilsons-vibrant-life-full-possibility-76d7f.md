  Wilson’s vibrant life, full of possibility, underscores the lifesaving power
  of gender-affirming care for young people. As a child, Wilson struggled
  through gender dysphoria and the attendant mental health issues it often
  causes. She’s horrified by the wave of anti-trans legislation targeting young
  people like her. In the US, her peers are being demonized by the right, and
  are left undefended by Democrats.
