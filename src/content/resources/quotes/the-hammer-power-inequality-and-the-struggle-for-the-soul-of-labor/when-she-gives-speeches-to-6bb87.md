  When she gives speeches to labor groups today, she always tells them that
  power is not a limited resource—that using power builds power. It is something
  to be exercised, not conserved. It is better to fight and get your ass kicked,
  she learned during those endless bankruptcy days, than not to fight at all.
  That single insight made her a radical.
