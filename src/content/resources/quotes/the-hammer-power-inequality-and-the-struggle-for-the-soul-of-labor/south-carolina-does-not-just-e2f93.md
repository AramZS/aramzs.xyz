  South Carolina does not just hurt South Carolinians by depriving almost all of
  them of any reasonable chance to unionize; it poses a serious threat to unions
  across the country by serving as a friendly acid bath that companies can dive
  into to dissolve any remnants of organized labor that may be clinging to them
  elsewhere.
