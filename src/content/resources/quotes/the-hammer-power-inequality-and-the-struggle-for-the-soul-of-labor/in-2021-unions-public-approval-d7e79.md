  In 2021, unions’ public approval rating hit its highest point in more than
  fifty years—68 percent—yet less than 7 percent of workers in the private
  sector actually had unions. The seeming inability of the nation’s largest
  labor organization to do anything to quench the public thirst for unions was
  maddening.
