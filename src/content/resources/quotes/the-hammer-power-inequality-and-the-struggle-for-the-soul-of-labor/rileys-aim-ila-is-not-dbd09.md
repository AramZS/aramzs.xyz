  Riley’s aim with the ILA is not to sit around and suck the companies dry, but
  rather to use the leverage that longshoremen have as a tool for progressive
  change. That has meant everything from working to improve the conditions of
  far more exploited dock workers in the Caribbean and Africa, to temporarily
  shutting down the Charleston port to protest a fire that killed factory
  workers in Bangladesh.
