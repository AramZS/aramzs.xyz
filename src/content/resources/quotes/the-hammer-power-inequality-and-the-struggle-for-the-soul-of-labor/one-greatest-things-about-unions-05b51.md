  One of the greatest things about unions is that they are a tool that belongs
  to you. You! You may be an average person in an average place with an average
  job. You may not be rich or famous or influential or well-connected. But
  starting right at your unremarkable workplace, you can become part of
  something capable of exercising power beyond your wildest belief. You can do
  something historic. You can start a union. You can lead a strike. You can
  force enormous companies to listen; you can compel exalted politicians to bow
  to the demands of normal folks. Your labor is your weapon. It is your hammer.
  A better America is right there. It’s waiting for you, and for all of us, to
  act.
