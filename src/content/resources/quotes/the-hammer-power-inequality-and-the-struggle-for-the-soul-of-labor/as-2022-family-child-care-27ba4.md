  As of 2022, family child care providers were paid 85 percent of the 2018
  survey rate to take care of kids. Consider what this means: not only does the
  state fail to keep its cost estimates current, but it boldly and without
  reservation declares, “We have determined how much it costs you to take care
  of kids, and we will pay you less than that. Deal with it.” It is an
  unambiguous example of state-enforced poverty imposed on an entire class of
  workers. The providers could, in theory, charge parents a copay to make up for
  the gap in what the state pays, but that wouldn’t really work in practice—the
  parents are, by definition, already unable to afford the cost of child care.
