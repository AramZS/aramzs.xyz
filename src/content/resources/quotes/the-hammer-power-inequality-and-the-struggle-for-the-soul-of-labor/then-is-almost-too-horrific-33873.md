  then is almost too horrific to contemplate. All these people who cared for
  children in their own homes were infrastructure, every bit as important as
  roads and bridges and farms and power lines. Their personal willingness to

  America to stave off a level of chaos that would have been much, much worse
  than what we experienced.
