  There has long been a sick competition among poor Southern states to offer
  themselves up as the place most willing to debase themselves for businesses
  willing to relocate there. It is an approach that harkens back to the
  nineteenth century, when the North was industrializing, but the South remained
  stubbornly wedded to free labor as its panacea. “We may be bad, but we’re
  cheap,” the theory goes.
