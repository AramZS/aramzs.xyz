  There has basically been one single dispute running through the entire history
  of the American labor movement. On one side are the people who believe that
  the most urgent task is to organize everyone who doesn’t have a union, because
  unions are the only tool that can maintain the critical balance of power
  between labor and capital. On the other side are the people who already have
  unions, and who believe that the important thing is to protect what they have.
  Organizing millions of unorganized workers seems to them to be at best a
  pleasantly idealistic, faraway goal, and at worst a fundamental threat to the
  style of power that they have cultivated—power that comes from organizing key
  pockets of skilled labor rather than from organizing everyone.
