  In a state like, say, New York, the typical teachers’ union contract runs
  fifty or even one hundred pages, with scrupulously detailed enforceable
  provisions covering everything from salaries to sabbaticals to school
  supplies. In South Carolina, thanks to the legal prohibition on public
  collective bargaining, a typical teacher’s contract is a single-page Contract
  for Employment, similar to what you might sign to accept a job at McDonald’s.
  It guarantees teachers nothing except the salary that the school board decides
  on—which, it is careful to note, may be reduced at any time due to loss of
  funding or furlough or decline in enrollment.
