  South Carolina has the most hostile version of this state law that exists,
  flat-out prohibiting public sector collective bargaining. Unlike many
  Republican states, they don’t even have an exception for police officers and
  firefighters. Hostility toward organized labor outweighs even the usual
  Republican need to worship at the altar of law enforcement.
