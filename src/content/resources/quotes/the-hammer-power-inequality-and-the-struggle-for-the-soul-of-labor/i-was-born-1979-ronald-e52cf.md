  I was born in 1979. Ronald Reagan took office when I was just a few months
  old. The biggest story of my lifetime is that the rich have gotten richer, and
  the rest of us haven’t. Another way to say this is that, since 1980, the
  hourly compensation of the average American worker has stayed almost flat,
  even as their productivity has risen by 75 percent. During that same time, the
  share of national wealth held by the top 0.00001 percent of American
  earners—the richest of the rich—has increased by 1,000 percent.
