  UNTIL THE AMERICAN LABOR MOVEMENT AS A WHOLE IS ABLE TO CONCEIVE of itself as
  a national movement responsible for reinforcing its own weak spots, the
  grinding fight to tread water in America’s most anti-union state will be
  sustained primarily by the scattered work of true believers. Often, it will be
  carried on the backs of longshoremen.
