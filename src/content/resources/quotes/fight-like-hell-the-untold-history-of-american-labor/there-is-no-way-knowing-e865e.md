  There is no way of knowing how many more disabled workers are being mistreated
  and abused throughout the country at this very moment, and as long as the
  subminimum wage remains on the books, employers will continue to have more
  opportunities to perpetuate the cycle of exploitation. “People with
  disabilities should be treated as equal to other people,” Mablin told
  Jayaraman. “We have to buy clothes, buy food, things we need or things we
  like, like everyone else.”
