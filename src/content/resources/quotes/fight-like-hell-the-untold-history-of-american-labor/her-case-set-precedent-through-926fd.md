  Her case set a precedent through which the state was able to sterilize
  thousands more “undesirable” people, predominantly the disabled, sex workers,
  Black women, Indigenous women, and other women of color. In 1961, civil rights
  icon Fannie Lou Hamer, a disabled Black woman, was forcibly sterilized without
  her knowledge; the procedure was so common at the time that it had its own
  nickname, the “Mississippi appendectomy.” Buck v. Bell has never been
  overturned.
