  The woman behind the New Deal was a queer feminist, a self-proclaimed
  “revolutionist” who fought for what was right even when it was unpopular, and
  refused to back down even after her bitter male colleagues in Congress tried
  to impeach her in 1939 over her support for radical union leader Harry
  Bridges. “I came to Washington to work for God, FDR, and the millions of
  forgotten, plain common workingmen,” she said of her time in government. And
  that is exactly what she did.
