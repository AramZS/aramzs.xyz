  Bessie Beatty and Rose Wilder Lane (daughter and collaborator to Little House
  on the Prairie author Laura Ingalls Wilder and influential member of the early
  libertarian movement), helped Gamble write out a speech for the next day’s
  events—a final, high-stakes meeting with the Reverend Smith. Smith was aghast
  when Gamble arrived, accompanied by a crowd of three hundred other sex
  workers. She swept past him and strode straight up to the pulpit, where her
  words made clear that this was a labor demonstration, and that these workers
  had gathered to discuss wages and their own social and economic oppression.
  They were not there to convince hard-hearted reformers of the morality of
  their profession, but were instead there to castigate them for their own role
  in perpetuating the conditions that left sex workers poor and desperate. “You
  want the city cleaned up around your church—but where do you want the women to
  go?” she asked him. “Men here in San Francisco say they want to eradicate
  vice. If they do, they better give up something of their dividends and pay the
  girls’ wages so they can live.”
