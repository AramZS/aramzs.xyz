  These conditions explain why alternative forms of resistance like hunger
  strikes, sick-outs, and slowdowns, as practiced by vulnerable workers outside
  the walls, are also so prevalent among incarcerated workers. With no way to
  form a picket line, hold mass meetings, or physically walk off the job, people
  in prison use whatever means are available to them to protest and organize.
