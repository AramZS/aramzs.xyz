  The deregulation of the trucking industry unfolded alongside the collapse of
  the Teamsters union under the weight of its various corruption scandals, the
  suspicious disappearance of Jimmy Hoffa, and its vicious squabbles over
  territory with other unions. Hundreds of unionized carriers went out of
  business during the first few years after the MCA was implemented, and as a
  result, the remaining carriers’ desire to avoid using union labor in favor of
  paying cheaper wages eviscerated the membership.
