  They called it the American Plan, and it became one of the largest and longest
  mass quarantines in U.S. history. The program operated more or less
  continuously from the 1910s through the 1940s, and in some places was enforced
  as late as the 1970s; laws passed under the plan were used during the 1980s
  and 1990s to forcibly quarantine HIV/AIDS patients. Its influence can also be
  traced to the Tuskegee Syphilis Study and the World War II–era internment
  camps, and helped to lay the groundwork for the current mass incarceration
  crisis. As I reported in a 2018 piece for the New Republic, the same Civilian
  Conservation Corps (CCC) camps later used to imprison Americans of Japanese
  and German descent during World War II originally functioned as “concentration
  camps” for sex workers and other women incarcerated under its auspices. These
  American Plan–era laws are still on the books in multiple states.
