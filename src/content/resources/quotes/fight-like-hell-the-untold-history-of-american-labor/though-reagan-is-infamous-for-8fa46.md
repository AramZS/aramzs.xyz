  Though Reagan is infamous for the many terrible policies he inflicted on the
  American people, within the world of labor, his most reviled action remains
  his brutal evisceration of the 1981 Professional Air Traffic Controllers
  Organization (PATCO) strike. Prior to this event, even during the most
  contentious labor conflicts, it was uncommon for companies to hire permanent
  replacements for striking workers; most workers could count on their jobs
  being there waiting for them upon their return, which made strike activity far
  less of an existential gamble than it would soon become.
