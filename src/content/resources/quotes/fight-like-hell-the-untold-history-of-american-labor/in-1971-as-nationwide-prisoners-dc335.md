  In 1971, as a nationwide prisoners’ rights movement picked up momentum, the
  most infamous prison rebellion in U.S. history exploded over five bloody days
  at the Attica Correctional Facility in Attica, New York. The original demands
  laid down by its architects, the Attica Liberation Faction, or Attica
  Brothers, were never met—an outcome that belies the basic nature of those
  requests: one line implored that prisoners be given “more fresh fruit” at
  mealtime, while another asked for a prison doctor to be provided. As the
  opening lines of the manifesto emphasized, “WE are MEN! We are not beasts and
  do not intend to be beaten or driven as such.”
