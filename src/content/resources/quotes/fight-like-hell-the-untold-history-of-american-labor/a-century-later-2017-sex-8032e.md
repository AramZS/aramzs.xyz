  A century later, in 2017, sex workers gathered on the steps of San Francisco’s
  Central Methodist Church once again to remember that history and affirm their
  community’s onging struggle for basic human rights. As representatives from
  the Erotic Service Provider’s Union, the Sex Worker’s Outreach Project, and
  the US PROStitutes Collective, a multiracial sex workers’ rights network
  founded in 1982, read out a new list of demands for sex workers’ rights in the
  twenty-first century, those assembled held signs reading “No Bad Women, Just
  Bad Laws!” and “Outlaw Poverty, Not Prostitution!” Their words bore a deep
  similarity to those that had been spoken in that same spot one hundred years
  before. “[Women] will always be coming into [sex work] as long as conditions,
  wages and education are as they are,” Madam Reggie Gamble had raged from that
  pulpit a hundred years before. “You don’t do any good by attacking us. Why
  don’t you attack those conditions?”
