  In 2018, Backpage, a classified advertising website that many sex workers used
  to screen clients and advertise their services, was shut down by the FBI. Only
  days later, the Stop Enabling Online Sex Trafficking Act (SESTA) and the Fight
  Online Sex Trafficking Act (FOSTA) were signed into law and immediately began
  to impact sex workers, rather than helping the trafficked people the law was
  allegedly written to protect. A 2020 Hacking/Hustling study authored by
  Danielle Blunt and Ariel Wolf with advisement from Naomi Lauren of Whose
  Corner Is It Anyway found that the law drastically reduced workers’ ability to
  screen clients, and post-SESTA/FOSTA, 99 percent of the sex workers they
  surveyed felt less safe. One respondent characterized it as “a bill that is
  aimed to stop sex trafficking but is making the sex work industry more
  dangerous.” The nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century reformers who went
  around trying to “save” fallen women are reborn anew in each generation of
  powerful elites who believe that they alone hold the answer to an age-old
  question that journalist Melissa Gira Grant articulates in her book Playing
  the Whore: The Work of Sex Work as having shifted from “What do we do about
  prostitution?” to “What do we do about prostitutes?”
