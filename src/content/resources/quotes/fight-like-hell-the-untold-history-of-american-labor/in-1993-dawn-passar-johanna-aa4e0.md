  In 1993, Dawn Passar and Johanna Breyer called a meeting of their fellow
  workers at the Market Street Cinema, a notoriously seedy strip club that was a
  favorite target of anti-porn crusader turned senator Dianne Feinstein, to
  discuss unsafe working conditions and the exploitative “stage fees” their
  bosses had implemented. The Exotic Dancers Alliance (EDA) was born. The group
  initially tried writing letters to the club’s owners asking that they reduce
  the stage fees and improve scheduling, but upon receiving no response, they
  decided to escalate their campaign. But California’s labor commissioner
  immediately put up another roadblock. “When we told the people that we were
  strippers, they hung up on us,” Passar, who was born in Thailand and spent ten
  years working in the U.S. sex industry, recalled in an interview with Dr.
  Siobhan Brooks. “This was one of the main reasons EDA was started, so that
  when we were asked by people at the Labor Commissar if we are part of an
  organization, we could say that we’re part of the Exotic Dancers Alliance
  organization. That way these people will listen to us.”
