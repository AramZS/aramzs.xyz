  Perkins was later quoted as saying that the New Deal began on March 25, 1911,
  the day she smelled the smoke and saw the bodies of those young women workers
  burn. She proved tireless in her drive to fight for workers’ safety, was
  deeply involved in efforts to combat unemployment during the Great Depression,
  and spearheaded the creation of an ambitious social safety net program we now
  know as Social Security.
