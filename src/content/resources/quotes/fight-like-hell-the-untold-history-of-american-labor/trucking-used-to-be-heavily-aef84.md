  Trucking used to be a heavily unionized industry, with high salaries and
  decent benefits to match. But that all changed after the Carter administration
  undertook a deregulation spree during the 1970s. The passage of the Motor
  Carrier Act (MCA) of 1980 cut costs for the consumer, but slashed drivers’
  earnings and shifted the onus for highway safety off of the federal government
  or the employers and onto the individual workers.
