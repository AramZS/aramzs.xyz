  In contrast, the flight attendants’ unions were the Gipper’s worst nightmare.
  For decades, their militant, progressive membership was predominantly made up
  of women and gay men, and they elected feminist activist Patt Gibbs, an out
  lesbian, to the presidency of the Association of Professional Flight
  Attendants in 1977. There is a long history of LGBTQ workers within the flight
  attendants’ unions and in that workforce, and the intersection between the
  women’s rights and queer liberation struggles has been a major driver behind
  those unions’ biggest wins and most heated battles.
