  “If we really take seriously that all labor has dignity and value, then, of
  course, that [includes] the most exploited sector,” said Dr. Dan Berger,
  University of Washington professor, historian, and author of Captive Nation:
  Black Prison Organizing in the Civil Rights Era. “If that demand is leveraged
  without the exclusions of incarcerated people, and without the exclusions of
  farmworkers and domestic workers and other people who have been traditionally
  discounted or ignored by the mainstream labor movement, then we’re not just
  having to fight for bigger cages and longer chains.”
