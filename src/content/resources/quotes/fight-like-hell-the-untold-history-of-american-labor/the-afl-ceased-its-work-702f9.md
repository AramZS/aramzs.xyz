  The AFL ceased its work with majority-Latino unions in the Southwest, and
  refused to organize Latino workers for decades afterward. Thanks to pernicious
  anti-immigrant rhetoric echoing out from politicians, unions, and the media,
  Mexican workers were met with racism, xenophobia, and violence, scorned for
  “taking American jobs,” and enthusiastically exploited by employers. During
  the 1930s, President Herbert Hoover enacted a massive deportation raid on
  people of Mexican descent, in which up to 1.8 million Latinos—nearly 60
  percent of whom were U.S. citizens—were forcibly removed to Mexico. (President
  Eisenhower would reprise this racist campaign in 1954, when more than 1
  million more Latino people were violently rounded up and deported.)
