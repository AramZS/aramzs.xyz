  By the 1830s, the American genocide against Indigenous people had been well
  underway for decades, and the few Indigenous women allowed into the workforce
  were treated abominably. As immigration ramped up during the middle of the
  nineteenth century, women workers from other ethnic groups—including, but not
  limited to, Irish immigrants fleeing a colonial famine and Russian Jews
  seeking to escape brutal repression—were also targeted by the ruling class’s
  white supremacist paternalism, attuned to uphold the privilege of its
  housebound Victorian angels. But that restrictive social fabric quickly began
  to fray as the Industrial Revolution took flight.
