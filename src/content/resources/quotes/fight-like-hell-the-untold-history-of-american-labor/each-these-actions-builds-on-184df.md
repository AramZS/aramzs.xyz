  Each of these actions builds on those that came before, and each new
  generation finds its own version of Ida B. Wells, Rosina Tucker, or Bayard
  Rustin to follow and fight alongside. As King told the workers in Memphis in
  1968, as their strike was beset by bloodthirsty police and politicians,
  “Nothing worthwhile is gained without sacrifice. The thing for you to do is
  stay together, and say to everybody in this community that you are going to
  stick it out to the end until every demand is met, and that you are gonna say,
  ‘We ain’t gonna let nobody turn us around.’ ”
