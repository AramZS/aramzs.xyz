  getting a contract can be just the beginning; building up a fledgling union
  and making it strong enough to enforce that hard-won legal agreement can be
  another struggle in and of itself. Dr. Brooks, who became a shop steward (a

  solidarity between white and Black workers continued to be a problem when it
  came to equal access to union benefits and discrimination at work.
