  Immigrant worker–led groups like Rideshare Drivers United and the New York
  Taxi Workers Alliance have taken cues from the labor movement’s past while
  working to shape its future in a way that translates corporate gain into
  material benefits for the workers off whose labor the corporations are
  profiting. These large-scale labor actions were but small examples of what can
  happen when the country’s movers and shakers decide they’ve had enough.
