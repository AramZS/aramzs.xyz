  In 1950, when the Matson Navigation Company refused to allow Luella Lawhorn, a
  Black woman, to work on its luxury liner Lurline, to Hawai’i, all 311 stewards
  on board walked off in protest. The union held firm and saw to it that Lawhorn
  became the first-ever Black stewardess on a U.S. passenger ship in the
  Pacific.
