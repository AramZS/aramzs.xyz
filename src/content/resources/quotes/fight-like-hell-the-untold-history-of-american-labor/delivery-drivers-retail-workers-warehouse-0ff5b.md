  Delivery drivers, retail workers, warehouse workers, sanitation workers, and
  agricultural workers were among the millions thrust onto the front lines of a
  terrifying plague, and were certainly some of the worst protected. “Those
  people, not only do they not have a safety net, but no matter what is going
  on, they have to continue to put their bodies and lives on the line,” Veena
  Dubal, a law professor at the University of California, Hastings, and a fierce
  advocate for marginalized workers, told me. “There’s some great tragic irony
  that it’s these ‘essential workers’ who are the most dispossessed: the people
  who are carved out of all [labor] protections, the people who do the most
  dangerous work, and the people whose life spans are the shortest as a result.”
