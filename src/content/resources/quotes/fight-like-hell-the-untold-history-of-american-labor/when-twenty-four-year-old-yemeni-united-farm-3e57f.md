  When twenty-four-year-old Yemeni United Farm Workers organizer Nagi Daifullah
  was murdered by California police during the Salad Bowl Strike in August 1973,
  Detroit’s Arab diaspora rallied to demand an inquiry into his death. One
  demonstration in South Dearborn, Michigan, drew about five hundred people,
  most of them Arab autoworkers. There, Patricia Proctor, a Detroit-area UFW
  organizer, noted that many of the Arab immigrants staffing the auto plants had
  started out as farmworkers in the California fields, underlining the strong
  connections between the two communities.
