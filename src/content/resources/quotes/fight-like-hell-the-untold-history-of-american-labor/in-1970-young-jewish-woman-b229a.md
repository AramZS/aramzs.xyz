  In 1970, a young Jewish woman named Judy Heumann made headlines when she sued
  the New York City Board of Education for discrimination after her teaching
  license was denied on the basis of her disability. When she was a little girl,
  she had been forbidden to attend school with her friends because school
  administrators dubbed her wheelchair “a fire hazard.” After winning her case
  in 1970, she became the first wheelchair user to work as a teacher in New York
  City, and that same year, she and a few friends started Disabled in Action
  (DIA), a direct action group focused on disabled people’s civil rights.
