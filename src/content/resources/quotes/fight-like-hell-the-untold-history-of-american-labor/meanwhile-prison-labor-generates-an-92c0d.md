  Meanwhile, prison labor generates an estimated $1 billion per year. Federal
  Prison Industries, also known as UNICOR, is a government-owned prison labor
  program that has begun marketing its incarcerated workers’ services to
  companies who want to avoid the costs associated with outsourcing their
  business and flaunt a “Made in America” label while paying next to nothing for
  slave labor right here at home. Under current federal law, all “physically
  able” prisoners who are judged not to be a security risk or have a health
  exception are required to work, either for UNICOR or at some other prison job,
  like food service or maintenance.
