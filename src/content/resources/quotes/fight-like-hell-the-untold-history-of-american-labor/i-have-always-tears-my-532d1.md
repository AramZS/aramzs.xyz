  I have always tears in my eyes when I think, “It should never have happened.”
  The executives with a couple of steps could have opened the door. But they
  thought they were better than the working people. It’s not fair because
  material, money, is more important here than everything. That’s the biggest
  mistake—that a person doesn’t count much when he hasn’t got money. What good
  is a rich man and he hasn’t got a heart?
