  During the 1930s, hundreds of Mohawk workers and their families took advantage
  of that ruling and moved south, building up a community around the Ironworkers
  Local 361 union hall on Atlantic Avenue in New York. They created a little
  slice of home the locals called “Downtown Kahnawake” that lasted until the
  early 1960s. As New York City’s building boom cooled down and the completion
  of the New York State Thruway slashed the commute between downtown Brooklyn
  and upstate New York, the skywalkers began to “boom out” in search of work
  elsewhere. The tradition persists, as Mohawk ironworkers continue traveling
  from work site to work site, walking iron and making superhuman feats of
  strength and agility look easy. In 2002, New York City paid its respects to
  those workers and their elders with an exhibit at the National Museum of the
  American Indian’s George Gustav Heye Center called “Booming Out: Mohawk
  Ironworkers Build New York.”
