  The Galveston News painted an unfortunate picture of the ways in which
  xenophobia, prejudice, and perceived scarcity can turn marginalized workers
  against one another: “At these laundries all the women talked at once, telling
  Sam Lee, Slam Sing, Wau Loong and the rest that ‘they must close up and leave
  this city within fifteen days, or they would be driven away,’ ” This viewpoint
  would prove to be a recurring theme throughout the early American labor
  movement, and remains a problem today, when far too many trade unionists still
  view immigrants as competition instead of welcoming them as fellow workers.
