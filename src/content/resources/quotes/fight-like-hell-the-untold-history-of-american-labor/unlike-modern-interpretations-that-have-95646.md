  Unlike modern interpretations that have been twisted by subsequent generations
  of bad-faith right-wing reactionaries, the Wobblies’ definition of free speech
  was simple, and served as a defining plank in their organizing strategy. They
  fought for the basic right to speak in public, to stand on their soapboxes and
  spread their message of industrial unionism, anti-capitalism, and the One Big
  Union to whoever wished to listen.
