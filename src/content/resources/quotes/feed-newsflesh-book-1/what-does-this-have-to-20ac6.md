  What does this have to do with the news? This: The truth isn’t scary. Not when
  you understand it, not when you understand the repercussions of it, and not
  when you aren’t worried that something’s being kept from you. The truth is
  only scary when you think part of it might be missing. And those people? They
  like it when you’re scared. So they do their best to sit on the truth, to
  sensationalize the truth, to filter the truth in ways that make it something
  you can be afraid of.
