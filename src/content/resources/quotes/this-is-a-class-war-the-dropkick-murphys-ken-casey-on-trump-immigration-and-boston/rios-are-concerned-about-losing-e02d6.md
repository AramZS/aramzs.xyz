  Rios: Are you concerned about losing fans, or have you gotten a lot of love
  because of the stances you're taking?

  Casey: " I want to be remembered as the band that spoke out, whether it
  benefits or hurts us. And now, as we put ourselves more in the crosshairs
  speaking out, I feel like more people on the left are like, ‘We gotta support
  this band,’ which is nice, but I don't really care. It's who we are and what
  we do."
