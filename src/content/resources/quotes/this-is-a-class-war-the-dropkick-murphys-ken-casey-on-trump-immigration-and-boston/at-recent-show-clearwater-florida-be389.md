  At a recent show in Clearwater, Florida, a man sporting MAGA gear stood in the
  front row. Casey offered him a friendly wager over whether his Make America
  Great Again shirt was actually made in America.


  The crowd roared as Casey revealed the shirt was made in Nicaragua. Casey
  swapped it for a Dropkick Murphy's t-shirt, which he said was "proudly made in
  America."

  After the show, Casey told me he approached the fan in the MAGA clothing.

  Casey: " I said, ‘Hey man. That was cool that you were a good sport about it
  and you honored the bet.’ And he said, ‘I've been coming to see you for 20
  years. You guys are family, and I don't let politics come between family.’ And
  I was like, wow. I think a lot of us have a lot more in common than politics
  would make us think."
