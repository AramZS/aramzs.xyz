  But that isn’t what Win Neuger did, because Win Neuger is a moron. What Neuger
  did, instead, is take that collateral and invest it in
  residential-mortgage-backed securities! In other words, he took cash and
  plunged it into the very risky, not-really-AAA AAA-rated securities that
  bankers like Andy were cranking out by the metric ton, thanks to the insane
  explosion of mortgage lending.
