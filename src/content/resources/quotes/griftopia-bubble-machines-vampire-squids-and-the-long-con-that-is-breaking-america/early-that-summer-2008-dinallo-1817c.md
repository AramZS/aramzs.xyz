  Early in that summer of 2008, Dinallo would chair a multistate task force
  charged with helping AIG “wind down” its crippled securities-lending business
  in such a way that AIG’s subsidiary insurance companies (and by extension the
  holders of policies issued by those companies) would not be harmed by any
  potential bankruptcy. The threat that a run on Neuger’s sec-lending business
  would result in these insurance companies getting bankrupted or seized by
  state insurance commissioners was like a guillotine that hung over the entire
  American economy in the summer of 2008—and, in ways that to this day remain
  unknown to most Americans, that guillotine would become a crucial factor in
  the decision to bail out AIG
