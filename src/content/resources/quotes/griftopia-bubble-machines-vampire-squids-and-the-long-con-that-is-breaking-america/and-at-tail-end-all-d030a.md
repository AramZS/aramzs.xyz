  And at the tail end of all this frantic lying, cheating, and scamming on all
  sides, during which time no good jobs were created and nothing except a few
  now-empty houses (good for nothing except depressing future home prices) got
  built, the final result is that we all ended up picking up the tab,
  subsidizing all this crime and dishonesty and pessimism as a matter of
  national policy. We paid for this instead of a generation of health insurance,
  or an alternative energy grid, or a brand-new system of roads and highways.
  With the $13-plus trillion we are estimated to ultimately spend on the
  bailouts, we could not only have bought and paid off every single subprime
  mortgage in the country (that would only have cost $1.4 trillion), we could
  have paid off every remaining mortgage of any kind in this country—and still
  have had enough money left over to buy a new house for every American who does
  not already have one. But we didn’t do that, and we didn’t spend the money on
  anything else useful, either. Why? For a very good reason. Because we’re no
  good anymore at building bridges and highways or coming up with brilliant
  innovations in energy or medicine. We’re shit now at finishing massive public
  works projects or launching brilliant fairy-tale public policy ventures like
  the moon landing. What are we good at? Robbing what’s left. When it comes to
  that, we Americans have no peer. And when it came time to design the bailouts,
  a monster collective project spanning two presidential administrations that
  was every bit as vast and far-reaching (only not into the future, but the
  past) as Kennedy’s trip to the moon, we showed it.
