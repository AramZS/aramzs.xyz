  Barack Obama talked a big game about Wall Street, but after he got elected he
  hired scads of Goldman and Citi executives to run economic policy out of his
  White House, and his reform bill ended up being a Swiss cheese shot through
  with preposterous loopholes. The Democrats’ response to Wall Street excess was
  similar to their attitude toward the Iraq War—they were against it in theory,
  but in practice, they weren’t going to do much about it.
