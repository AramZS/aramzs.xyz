  It was almost the perfect example of politics in the Bubble Era, where the
  time horizon for anyone with any real power is always close to zero, long-term
  thinking is an alien concept, and even the most massive and ambitious
  undertakings are motivated entirely by short-term rewards. A radical reshaping
  of the entire economy, for two election cycles’ worth of campaign cash—that
  was what this bill meant. It sounds absurdly reductive to say so, but there’s
  no other explanation that makes any sense.
