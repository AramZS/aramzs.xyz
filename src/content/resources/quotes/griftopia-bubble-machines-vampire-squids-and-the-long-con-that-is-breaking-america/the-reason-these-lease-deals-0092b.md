  The reason these lease deals happen is the same reason the investment banks
  made bad investments in mortgage-backed crap that was sure to blow up later,
  but provided big bonuses today—because the politicians making these deals, the
  Rendells and Daleys, are going to be long gone into retirement by the time the
  real bill comes due. Welcome to life in the Grifter Archipelago.
