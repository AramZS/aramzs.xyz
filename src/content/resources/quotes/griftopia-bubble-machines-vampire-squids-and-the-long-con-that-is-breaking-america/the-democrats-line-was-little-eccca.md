  The Democrats’ line was a little more complicated. They had no problem
  publicly pointing the finger at companies like Goldman Sachs as culprits in
  the mess, although behind closed doors, of course, it was Democratic officials
  like Geithner who were carrying water for Wall Street all along, arranging
  sweetheart deals like the Wachovia rescue and the Citigroup bailout (notable
  because Geithner’s ex-boss, former Clinton Treasury secretary Bob Rubin, was a
  big Citi exec).
