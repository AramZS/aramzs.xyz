  state and municipal executives began putting their infrastructure assets up to
  lease—essentially for sale, since the proposed leases in some cases were
  seventy-five years or longer. And in virtually every case that I’ve been able
  to find, the local legislature was never informed who the true owners of these
  leases were. Probably the best example of this is the notorious Chicago
  parking meter deal, a deal that would have been a hideous betrayal even
  without the foreign ownership angle. It was a blitzkrieg rip-off that would
  provide the blueprint for increasingly broke-ass America to carry lots of
  these prized toasters to the proverbial pawnshop.
