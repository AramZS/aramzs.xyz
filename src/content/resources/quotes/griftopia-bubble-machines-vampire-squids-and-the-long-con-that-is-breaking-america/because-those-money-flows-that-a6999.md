  “Because those money flows that Goldman’s marketing efforts create can move
  prices by themselves.” This story is the ultimate example of America’s biggest
  political problem. We no longer have the attention span to deal with any
  twenty-first-century crisis. We live in an economy that is immensely complex
  and we are completely at the mercy of the small group of people who understand
  it—who incidentally often happen to be the same people who built these wildly
  complex economic systems.
