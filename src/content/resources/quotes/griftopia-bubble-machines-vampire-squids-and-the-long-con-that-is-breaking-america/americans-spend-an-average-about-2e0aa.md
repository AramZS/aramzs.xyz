  Americans spend an average of about $7,200 a year on health care, compared
  with the roughly $2,900 average for the other market economies that make up
  the OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development), and for that
  greatly increased outlay we get higher infant mortality, higher obesity rates,
  lower longevity, fewer doctors per 1,000 people (just 2.4 per 1,000 in the
  United States, compared with 3.1 in OECD states), and fewer acute care
  hospital beds (2.7 per 1,000, compared to 3.8 per 1,000 in the OECD
  countries).
