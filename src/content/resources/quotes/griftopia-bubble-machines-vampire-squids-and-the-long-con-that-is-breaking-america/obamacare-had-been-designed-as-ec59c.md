  Obamacare had been designed as a coldly cynical political deal: massive
  giveaways to Big Pharma in the form of monster subsidies, and an equally
  lucrative handout to big insurance in the form of an individual mandate

  be forced to buy their products at artificially inflated, federally protected
  prices.
