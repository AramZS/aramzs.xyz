  A toll highway in Indiana. The Chicago Skyway. A stretch of highway in
  Florida. Parking meters in Nashville, Pittsburgh, Los Angeles, and other
  cities. A port in Virginia. And a whole bevy of Californian public
  infrastructure projects, all either already leased or set to be leased for
  fifty or seventy-five years or more in exchange for one-off lump sum payments
  of a few billion bucks at best, usually just to help patch a hole or two in a
  single budget year.
