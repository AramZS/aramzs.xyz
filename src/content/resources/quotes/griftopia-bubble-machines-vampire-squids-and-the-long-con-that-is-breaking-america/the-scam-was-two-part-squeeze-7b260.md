  The scam was a two-part squeeze. Part one was the commodities bubble, a
  completely avoidable speculative mania that drove oil prices through the roof.
  It is perhaps the first bubble in history that badly wounded a mighty
  industrial empire without anyone even realizing it happened. Most Americans do
  not even know that it took place. That was part of the beauty of the grift—the
  oil supply crisis that never was.
