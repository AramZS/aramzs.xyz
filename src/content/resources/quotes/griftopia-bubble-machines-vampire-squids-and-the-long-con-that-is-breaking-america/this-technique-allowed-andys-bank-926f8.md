  This technique allowed Andy’s bank to take all the unsalable BBB-rated extras
  from these giant mortgage deals, jiggle them around a little using some
  mathematical formulae, and—presto! All of a sudden 70 percent of your
  unsalable BBB-rated pseudo-crap (“which in reality is more like B-minus-rated
  stuff, since the FICO scores aren’t accurate,” reminds Andy) is now very
  salable AAA-rated prime paper, suitable for selling to would-be risk-avoidant
  pension funds and insurance companies. It’s the same homeowners and the same
  loans, but the wrapping on the box is different. “You couldn’t make this stuff
  up if you tried, in your most diabolical imagination,”
