  A credit default swap is just a bet on an outcome. It works like this: Two
  bankers get together and decide to bet on whether or not a homeowner is going
  to default on his $300,000 home loan. Banker A, betting against the homeowner,
  offers to pay Banker B $1,000 a month for five years, on one condition: if the
  homeowner defaults, Banker B has to pay Banker A the full value of the home
  loan, in this case $300,000. So Banker B has basically taken 5–1 odds that the
  homeowner will not default. If he does not default, Banker B gets $60,000 over
  five years from Banker A. If he does default, Banker B owes Banker A $300,000.
