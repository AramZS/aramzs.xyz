  It used to be that, in line with the Basel Accords, banks had to have at least
  one dollar in reserve for every eight they lent; the CDS was a way around
  that. Say Bank A is holding $10 million in A-minus-rated IBM bonds. It goes to
  Bank B and makes a deal: we’ll pay you $50,000 a year for five years and in
  exchange, you agree to pay us $10 million if IBM defaults sometime in the next
  five years—which of course it won’t, since IBM never defaults. If Bank B
  agrees, Bank A can then go to the Basel regulators and say, “Hey, we’re
  insured if something goes wrong with our IBM holdings. So don’t count that as
  money we have at risk. Let us lend a higher percentage of our capital, now
  that we’re insured.” It’s a win-win. Bank B makes, basically, a free $250,000.
  Bank A, meanwhile, gets to lend out another few million more dollars, since
  its $10 million in IBM bonds is no longer counted as at-risk capital.
