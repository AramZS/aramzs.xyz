  But the most obnoxious part of the deal is that the city is now forced to cede
  control of their streets to a virtually unaccountable private and at least
  partially foreign-owned company. Written into the original deal were drastic
  price increases. In Hairston’s and Colon’s neighborhoods, meter rates went
  from 25¢ an hour to $1.00 an hour the first year, and to $1.20 an hour the
  year after that. And again, the city has no power to close streets, remove or
  move meters, or really do anything without asking the permission of Chicago
  Parking Meters LLC.
