  This is especially true if you have not only knowledge but access. I’ve been
  thinking a lot about access lately. Access is seductive. Access means good
  nuggets from a campaign. Access means your calls answered. Access is safe and
  secure, because you’re the one at your organization who can always get a
  comment, a confirmation, or an exclusive interview. But access journalism is
  barely journalism. And somewhere along the way, out here on the trail,
  wherever it is I am right now, I decided that access journalism isn’t worth
  it.
