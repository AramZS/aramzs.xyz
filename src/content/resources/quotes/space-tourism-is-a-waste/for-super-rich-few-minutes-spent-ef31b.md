  For the super-rich, a few minutes spent experiencing weightlessness and
  viewing the curvature of the Earth could leave humanity footing an ever-larger
  carbon pollution bill. It also reflects the increasingly unsustainable levels
  of inequality and concentration of power, which, coupled with the climate
  crisis, will lock in suffering for billions. That’s nothing to celebrate
