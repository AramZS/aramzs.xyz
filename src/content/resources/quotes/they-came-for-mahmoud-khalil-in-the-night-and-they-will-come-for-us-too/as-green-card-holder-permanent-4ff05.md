  As a Green Card holder and permanent resident, Khalil is not a typical
  candidate for deportation. However, the case against him has proceeded at the
  behest of the Secretary of State, who is invoking a rarely-used provision of
  the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). The provision reads: “An alien
  whose presence or activities in the United States the Secretary of State has
  reasonable ground to believe would have potentially serious adverse foreign
  policy consequences for the United States is deportable.”




  The INA, also known as the McCarran-Walter Act, became law in 1952. As The
  Forward has reported, “The act’s quotas and ideological litmus test were
  widely understood at the time to target Eastern European Jewish Holocaust
  survivors suspected of being Soviet agents.”
