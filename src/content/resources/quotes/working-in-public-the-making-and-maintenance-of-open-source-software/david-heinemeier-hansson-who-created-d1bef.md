  David Heinemeier Hansson, who created Ruby on Rails, is a vocal advocate for a
  commons-based approach to open source production: External, expected rewards
  diminish the intrinsic motivation of the fundraising open-source contributor.
  It risks transporting a community of peers into a transactional terminal. And
  that buyer-seller frame detracts from the magic that is peer-collaborators.
