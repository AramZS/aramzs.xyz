  Anthropologist Michael Wesch uses the term “context collapse” to describe how
  YouTube’s wide reach affects how people present themselves online. Instead of
  having in-person interactions, which occur within a specific context, YouTube
  creators experience “an infinite number of contexts collapsing upon one
  another into that single moment of recording.”
