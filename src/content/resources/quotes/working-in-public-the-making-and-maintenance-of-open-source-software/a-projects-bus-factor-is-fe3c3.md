  A project’s bus factor is the number of contributors that would need to get
  hit by a bus before the project is compromised. For example, if a project has
  a bus factor of 1, that means there is only one maintainer, who, if they were
  hit by a bus, would take all their knowledge of the project to their grave.
  The implication is that projects with higher bus factors are more resilient,
  because knowledge is distributed among more people.
