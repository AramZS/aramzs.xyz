  In the second half of the twentieth century, the economist Elinor Ostrom spent
  decades studying the conditions that lead to a flourishing commons, such as
  forests, fisheries, irrigation systems, and other common pool resources.* She
  tried to understand how people produce in a commons, and why some resources
  are successfully self-managed, thus avoiding the so-called “tragedy of the
  commons” (wherein resources are depleted by people acting in their own
  self-interest, rather than in the collective interest) and the need for either
  market or government intervention.
