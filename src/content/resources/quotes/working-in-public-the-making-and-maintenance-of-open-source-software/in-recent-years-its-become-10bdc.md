  In recent years, it’s become more common for open source projects to have
  codes of conduct. This decision sometimes leads to emotionally charged
  discussions between those who see codes of conduct as politically motivated
  and others who don’t understand how enforcing civil behavior could possibly be
  controversial. At the heart of these conversations lies a question of who has
  the authority to make and set policies for a given community.
