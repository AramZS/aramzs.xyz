  The tribalistic nature of open source is frequently overlooked and
  misunderstood. As we’ve seen from the evolution of “hackers” to the more
  neutral “programmers” or “engineers,” to the polished-sounding “developers”
  today, there is no “open source community,” really, anymore than there is an
  “urban community.” Certainly, one city dweller can sympathize with another in
  many ways, especially when comparing themselves to their suburban or rural
  counterparts. But knowing the streets of San Francisco says nothing about how
  well you’ll fare in Hong Kong. “Urban” is an adjective, not an end point.
