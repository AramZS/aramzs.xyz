  In terms of coordination effort, it could be less costly to designate one
  person as the leader, whose job it is to collect information from everyone and
  keep all the work in one place. But when you have a group of strangers who are
  loosely affiliated with one another and excited to participate, and nobody is
  officially in charge, it’s more likely that a bunch of people will volunteer
  all at once. Intrinsic motivation makes it easier for people to self-organize
  to achieve the same outcome.
