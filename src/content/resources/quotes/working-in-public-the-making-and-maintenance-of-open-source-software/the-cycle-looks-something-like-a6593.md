  The cycle looks something like this: Open source developers write and publish
  their code in public. They enjoy months, maybe years, in the spotlight. But,
  eventually, popularity offers diminishing returns. If the value of maintaining
  code fails to outpace the rewards, many of these developers quietly retreat to
  the shadows.
