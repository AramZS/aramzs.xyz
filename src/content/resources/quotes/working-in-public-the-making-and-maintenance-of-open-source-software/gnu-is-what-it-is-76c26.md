  GNU is what it is because it is not hosted on GitHub. By contrast, today’s
  generation of open source developers needs GitHub to do their best work. Just
  as there are Instagram influencers and Twitch streamers, there are GitHub
  developers. These activities take place away from platforms, too—you can still
  upload photos or videos of your Hawaii vacation to a self-hosted website—but
  why would you? For those hoping to reach an audience, platforms and creators
  have become inseparable.
