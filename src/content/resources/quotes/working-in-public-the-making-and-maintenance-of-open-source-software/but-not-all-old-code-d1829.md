  But not all old code is actively depended upon, even if it continues to exist.
  For example, the code used to manage Apollo 11’s command and lunar modules,
  first written in 1969, was published on GitHub in 2016, meaning that it is
  still publicly accessible today.193 We can view, fork, and modify Apollo 11’s
  code, but it’s widely understood that the code is archival. The code that is
  available on GitHub was digitized from a hard copy that lives in the MIT
  Museum; it’s not expected that anyone will run it today.
