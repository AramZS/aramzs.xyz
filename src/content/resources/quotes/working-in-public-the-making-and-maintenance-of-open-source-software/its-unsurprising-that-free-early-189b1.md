  It’s unsurprising that free and early open source developers like to talk
  about the freedom to fork. Forking is a useful exit strategy when we ignore
  the dependencies and upkeep required by the project in question. In reality, a
  widely used project makes itself unforkable because it’s become more than just
  the code.
