  In the surgical-team model, there is a “chief programmer,” who, like a
  surgeon, sets the project’s specifications and design. The surgeon has a
  “copilot,” who serves as their confidante and right arm. Then there are a
  number of supporting roles, including someone who handles money and
  administration, someone who writes documentation, and so on.
