  The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), which develops the standards
  behind our internet protocols, uses what it calls “rough consensus” to
  reconcile the tension between authoritative and democratic governance, given a
  hard-to-define constituency: “Our credo is that we don’t let a single
  individual dictate decisions (a king or president), nor should decisions be
  made by a vote.”132 In a consensus-seeking model, the goal is not to “win”
  votes or come to a unanimous agreement, but rather to ensure that there’s a
  forum for people to raise and discuss their concerns, and that nobody feels
  strongly enough to block the group from moving forward. Consensus-seeking
  emphasizes discussion over enumeration: “Rough consensus is achieved when all
  issues are addressed, but not necessarily accommodated.”
