  If maintainers were to defer to their community, how could they assess overall
  opinion, given the lack of clear membership boundaries? Countries have
  citizenships and constituencies, but open source projects are open to anyone.
  If someone made a one-time contribution to Opal, does that make them a
  “contributor” in the same sense as a lead maintainer? How do we know if the
  developers opposing or favoring action represent a minority voice, if we don’t
  know the actual population of the community?
