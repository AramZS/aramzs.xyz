  Coase’s theory of the firm fails to explain why these developers would find
  one another and make software together, despite a lack of both formal
  contracts and financial compensation. In terms of transaction costs,
  collaborating on open source software with unaffiliated individuals should be
  too “expensive,” compared to writing software with one’s coworkers. But a few
  people noticed that these open source projects operated like communities, so
  they instead explained the projects’ behavior by describing them as a commons,
  meaning a resource that is owned, used, and managed by a community. These
  communities rely upon self-governed rules, rather than outside intervention,
  to manage the resource and avoid over-provisioning or depletion.
