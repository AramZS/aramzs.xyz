  In the early 2000s, Yochai Benkler expanded upon Ostrom’s model by applying
  her findings to the online world. He terms this communal structure
  commons-based peer production (CBPP) in a 2002 essay called “Coase’s Penguin,
  Or, Linux and ‘The Nature of the Firm.’” (The title is a reference to Linux’s
  mascot, which is a penguin; in the paper, Benkler leans heavily upon the
  example of open source software to make his case.) Benkler observed that
  people were collaborating online for seemingly no obvious reason beyond
  personal satisfaction. He tried to understand how and why people would do this
  outside of Coase’s firm (i.e., in their spare time), given that it should be
  more transactionally expensive.
