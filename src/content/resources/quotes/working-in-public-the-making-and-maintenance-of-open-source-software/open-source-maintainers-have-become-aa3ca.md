  Open source maintainers have become the de facto teachers for developers who
  are learning how to contribute. In the past, this made sense when new
  developers were trying to join a project’s community. Today, rehashing the
  basics to a revolving door of strangers can be fatiguing: death by a thousand
  paper cuts. Developer Nolan Lawson describes his experience as “a perverse
  effect where, the more successful you are, the more you get ‘punished’ with
  GitHub notifications.”
