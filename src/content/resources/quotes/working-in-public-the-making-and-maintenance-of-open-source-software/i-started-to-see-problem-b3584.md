  I started to see the problem is not that there’s a dearth of people who want
  to contribute to an open source project, but rather that there are too many
  contributors—or they’re the wrong kind of contributors. Open source code is
  public, but it doesn’t have to be participatory: maintainers can buckle under
  excess demand for their attention.
