  Ostrom identified eight design principles that contribute to a well-managed,
  successful commons: Membership boundaries are clearly defined. The rules that
  govern the commons should match the actual conditions. Those who are affected
  by these rules can participate in modifying them. Those who monitor the rules
  are either community members or are accountable to the community, rather than
  outsiders. Those who violate the rules are subject to graduated sanctions,
  which vary depending on the seriousness and context of the offense. Conflicts
  should be resolved within the community, using low-cost methods. External
  authorities recognize the right of community members to devise their own
  institutions. If the commons is part of a larger system, its governing rules
  are organized into multiple “nested” layers of authority.
