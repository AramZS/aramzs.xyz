  After Jim Weirich, a prominent open source developer in the Ruby community,
  passed away, the community realized he had not named a successor to many of
  his projects. When another developer, Justin Searls, wanted to step in to
  maintain one of those projects, Rspec-Given, he wasn’t able to gain
  administrative access. Instead, he had to fork the project and convince
  RubyGems, the package manager for Ruby, to point to the new version.
