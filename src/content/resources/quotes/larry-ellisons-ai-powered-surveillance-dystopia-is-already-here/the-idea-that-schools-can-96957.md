  The idea that schools can be made safe with technology (or armed teachers, or
  more police) rather than, say, making guns harder to access, has become a cash
  cow for surveillance tech companies in the age of near-constant school
  shootings. Many schools have begun to implement AI-powered weapon detectors,
  which are notoriously inaccurate and which have, for example, detected
  notebooks as “weapons,” missed actual weapons, and led to what one
  administrator called “the least safe day” because of mass confusion associated
  with the scanners. Students are also being monitored in the hallways, in the
  bathroom, on social media, and on their school-issued devices. It’s unclear
  that any of this has made schools any safer.
