  Indeed, there was a subtle suggestion that CPAC had chosen Yiannopoulos
  precisely to hoist Bannon and the White House on the implicit connection to
  him—Yiannopoulos had been something of a Bannon protégé. When, two days before
  CPAC opened, a conservative blogger discovered a video of Yiannopoulos in
  bizarre revelry seeming to rationalize pedophilia, the White House made it
  clear he had to go.
