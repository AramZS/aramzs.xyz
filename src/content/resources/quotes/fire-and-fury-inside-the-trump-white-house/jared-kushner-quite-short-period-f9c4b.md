  Jared Kushner in quite a short period of time—rather less than a year—had
  crossed over from the standard Democratic view in which he was raised, to an
  acolyte of Trumpism, bewildering many friends and, as well, his own brother,
  whose insurance company, Oscar, funded with Kushner-family money, was destined
  to be shattered by a repeal of Obamacare.
