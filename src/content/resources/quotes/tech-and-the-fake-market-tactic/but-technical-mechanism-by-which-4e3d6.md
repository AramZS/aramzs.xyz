  But the technical mechanism by which Facebook and Google provide that faster
  reading experience happens to incidentally displace most of the third-party
  advertising platforms — the ones that aren’t provided by Facebook and Google
  themselves. Facebook publishers who use these new distribution channels are
  incentivized to use Facebook’s advertising platform, where payment rates and
  profit margins can be unilaterally changed at any time. Just as Uber
  subsidizes fares during the phase when they’re displacing regulated taxis,
  Facebook subsidizes publishers’ ad rates during the phase when they’re
  displacing third-party advertising networks.
