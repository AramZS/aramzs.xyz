  Braun pitched an idea he called “Lost.” He described the show as a cross
  between Cast Away, the 2000 movie starring Tom Hanks as a survivor on a desert
  island, and “Survivor.” (Like “The Sopranos,” many of Braun’s series ideas
  have come from feature films.) But, Braun explained, “not a guy alone on a
  desert island with a soccer ball, but rather a group of people who find
  themselves thrown together and now have to make a life together and form a
  society. A world where no one knows who anyone really is, where, at the end of
  the day, everyone has to figure out, ‘how the hell do we get off this island?’
