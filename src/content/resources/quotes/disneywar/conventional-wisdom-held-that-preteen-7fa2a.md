  Conventional wisdom held that preteen girls comprised too small a market for
  feature films, that girls would go to boys’ movies as dates or friends, but
  that boys would shun girls’ movies. But Disney’s The Parent Trap, starring
  Lindsay Lohan in a 1998 remake of the Disney classic starring Hayley Mills,
  had unexpectedly grossed $92 million, showing that the market existed. As a
  result, The Lizzie McGuire Movie was immediately put into development.
