  Besides, he didn’t think CBS would be willing to pick up the production costs,
  and if Disney pulled out, the show would die, creating a hole in the CBS
  lineup. Braun was ordered to call Bruckheimer and pull the plug. The
  unflappable Bruckheimer took the news calmly. He was disappointed but
  gracious. But Eisner and Iger underestimated his determination, and that of
  Les Moonves, the head of CBS. Instead of dropping “CSI,” as they had
  anticipated, CBS lined up another producer, Alliance Atlantis Communications,
  which presold some foreign rights to raise $800,000 per episode, an amount
  that nearly covered the projected deficit. CBS financed the rest, minimizing
  the potential loss. CBS placed “CSI” as the centerpiece of its Friday night
  schedule for fall 2000.
