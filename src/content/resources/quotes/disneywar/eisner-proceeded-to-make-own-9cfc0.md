  Eisner proceeded to make his own priorities clear. “We have no obligation to
  make art. We have no obligation to make history. We have no obligation to make
  a statement. But to make money, it is often important to make history, to make
  art, or to make some significant statement…. In order to make money, we must
  always make entertaining movies, and if we make entertaining movies, at times
  we will reliably make history, art, a statement, or all three. We may even win
  awards…. We cannot expect numerous hits, but if every film has an original and
  imaginative concept, then we can be confident that something will break
  through.”
