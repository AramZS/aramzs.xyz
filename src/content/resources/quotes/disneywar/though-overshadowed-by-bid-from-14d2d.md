  Though overshadowed by the bid from Comcast, Disney executives faced a
  potential revolt by institutional shareholders. Roy and Gold—taking as their
  model Howard Dean’s grassroots, Internet-based campaign for the Democratic
  presidential nomination—had launched a website, SaveDisney.com, as the
  centerpiece of their effort to unseat Eisner. They became the first dissident
  shareholders to attempt to use the Internet to democratize the notoriously
  unresponsive system of corporate governance. “Shareholder democracy,” while
  lauded as the centerpiece of democratic capitalism, had in fact become an
  oxymoron, with the vast majority of corporations firmly in the grip of their
  chief executives and acquiescent boards.
