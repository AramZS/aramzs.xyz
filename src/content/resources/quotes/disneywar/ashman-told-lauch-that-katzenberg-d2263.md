  Ashman told Lauch that Katzenberg had been great, taking the news in stride.
  “Okay,” Katzenberg had said. “What do you need? We’ll do it.” Schneider and
  Eisner were equally supportive. They were surprised, but realized they
  shouldn’t have been, given Ashman’s increasing absences in California. At
  considerable expense, Disney moved the entire Beauty and the Beast team to the
  Residence Inn, an extended-stay hotel in Fishkill, New York, a Hudson River
  town not far from Ashman’s house.
