  Disney had to ask televangelist Pat Robertson to lobby some carriers, such as
  EchoStar Communications, after the satellite broadcaster tried to drop the
  Family channel. In a letter to EchoStar, Robertson wrote that he couldn’t
  believe the company would deny its subscribers “quality family programs” at
  the same time as it provided “five channels of pornographic material.”
