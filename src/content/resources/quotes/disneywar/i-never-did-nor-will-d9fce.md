  I never did nor will I ever do what we call ‘touch-and-go’ relationships,
  which is where you go meet someone, you salvage it through whatever means
  necessary…and then you just don’t talk to them again. Every time I went after
  one of these people I made them my client, so I had lunch with them once a
  month. I called them constantly to see how they were doing. I sent them things
  on their birthday or their anniversaries or things that were important. I
  helped them if their kids needed to get into a hospital with my connections.
  That was part of my job. Can you quantify that for shareholders? I don’t know
  that you can do that. No one else at that company was capable of doing it.”
