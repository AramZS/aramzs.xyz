  Katzenberg was also working to salvage Toy Story, Disney’s first joint venture
  with Pixar. Late that year, John Lasseter and his team came to Burbank and
  screened some of it for Katzenberg, Schneider, and Thomas Schumacher, who was
  acting as the Disney liaison to Pixar. While they still liked the idea of toys
  coming to life, the Disney executives agreed that the project was a “mess,” as
  Katzenberg put it. There was no coherent narrative line. But suddenly
  Katzenberg had an idea: In the characters Woody and Buzz Lightyear, the retro
  cowboy and the futuristic spaceman, Lasseter had the makings of a classic
  buddy movie. “Go out and watch two movies,” Katzenberg told Lasseter and his
  team, “The Defiant Ones and 48 Hrs.” Both were classic “buddy” pictures where
  opposites bond, with 1958’s The Defiant Ones starring Sidney Poitier and Tony
  Curtis.
