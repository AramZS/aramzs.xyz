  In the ghettos, as in the extermination camps to which they were the
  antechamber, the résistants embarked on a race against death. To struggle and
  resist was the only lucid choice, but this most often meant for the fighters
  no more than choosing the time and manner of their death. Beyond the immediate
  outcome of the struggle, which most often was inevitable, their combat was for
  history, for memory … This affirmation of life by way of a sacrifice and
  combat with no prospect of victory is a tragic paradox that can only be
  understood as an act of faith in history, Alain Brossat and Sylvie Klingberg
