  Reaching the days of Margaret Thatcher’s poll tax, one must ask if there is a
  little censoring angel sitting on the shoulder of the strategic pacifist and
  instructing him in the ways of redaction. As everyone who has ever heard of
  the tax knows, the revolt culminated in mass riots in London that killed it
  off.
