  ‘Current investments’, the study on coal observes, can be seen ‘as an
  indication that investors do not believe in future climate policy or that they
  are confident in their own lobbying power.’ They still feel that they own the
  world. Fixed capital of this size is normally subject to risks and sensitive
  to the anticipated ‘policy context’. Given the money involved, it would be
  imprudent to undertake these investments if swings and alterations in the
  economy threatened premature devaluation, let alone liquidation, but these
  capitalists do not see any wrecking balls coming their way. They think they
  have nothing to fear.
