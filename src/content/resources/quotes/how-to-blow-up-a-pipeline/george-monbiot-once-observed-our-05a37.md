  George Monbiot once observed: Our dreaming will, as it has begun to do
  already, destroy the conditions necessary for human life on Earth. Were we
  governed by reason, we would be on the barricades today, dragging the drivers
  of Range Rovers and Nissan Patrols out of their seats, occupying and shutting
  down the coal-burning power stations, bursting in upon the Blairs’ retreat
  from reality in Barbados and demanding a reversal of economic life as dramatic
  as the one we bore when we went to war with Hitler.
