  not only is it easier to imagine the end of the world than the end of
  capitalism, or the deliberate, large-scale intervention in the climate system
  – what we refer to as geoengineering – than in the economic system; it is also
  easier, at least for some, to imagine learning to die than learning to fight,
  to reconcile oneself to the end of everything one holds dear than to consider
  some militant resistance.
