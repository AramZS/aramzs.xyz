  From his cell, King could now signal a warning: if the demands of his movement
  were not met, other, more menacing forces would arise. If the channel of
  non-violence remained closed, ‘millions of Negroes, out of frustration and
  despair, will seek solace and security in black nationalist ideologies’ and
  then ‘the streets of the South would be flowing with floods of blood’.
