  After the Sharpeville massacre in 1960, the ANC leaders realised that they had
  to ratchet up the pressure and formed Umkhonto we Sizwe, the Spear of the
  Nation, or MK. It was Nelson Mandela who pushed for the reorientation: ‘Our
  policy to achieve a non-racial state by non-violence has achieved nothing’,
  and so ‘we will have to reconsider our tactics. In my mind we are closing a
  chapter on this question of a non-violent policy.’
