  The commitment to the endless accumulation of capital wins out every time.
  After the past three decades, there can be no doubt that the ruling classes
  are constitutionally incapable of responding to the catastrophe in any other
  way than by expediting it; of their own accord, under their inner compulsion,
  they can do nothing but burn their way to the end.
