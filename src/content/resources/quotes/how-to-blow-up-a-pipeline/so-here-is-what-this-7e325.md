  So here is what this movement of millions should do, for a start: announce and
  enforce the prohibition. Damage and destroy new CO2-emitting devices. Put them
  out of commission, pick them apart, demolish them, burn them, blow them up.
  Let the capitalists who keep on investing in the fire know that their
  properties will be trashed.
