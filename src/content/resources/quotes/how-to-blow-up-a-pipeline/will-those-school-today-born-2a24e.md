  will those in school today or born next year grow up to think that the
  machines of the fossil economy were accorded insufficient respect? Or will
  they look back on this moment in time rather like we, or at least those of us
  with a modicum of feminist leanings, look back on the suffragettes and see
  smashed windows as a price worth paying?
