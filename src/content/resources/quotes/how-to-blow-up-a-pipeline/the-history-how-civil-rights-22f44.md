  the history of how the civil rights movement was girdled with armed
  protection. In the Deep South, rural African American communities had
  developed a long tradition of staving off murderous assaults with weapons;
  when the movement took root and began to deliver concrete benefits, it faced
  the same threat to physical survival.
