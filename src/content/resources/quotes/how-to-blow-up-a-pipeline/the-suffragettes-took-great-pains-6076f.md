  The suffragettes took great pains to avoid injuring people. But they
  considered the situation urgent enough to justify incendiarism – votes for
  women, Pankhurst explained, were of such pressing importance that ‘we had to
  discredit the Government and Parliament in the eyes of the world; we had to
  spoil English sports, hurt businesses, destroy valuable property, demoralise
  the world of society, shame the churches, upset the whole orderly conduct of
  life’.
