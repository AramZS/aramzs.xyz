  the former would fight for the possibility of civilisation, in the sense of
  organised social life for Homo sapiens. Unlike the deep variety, it would
  target a particular deformed kind of civilisation – namely, that erected on
  the plinth of fossil capital – and tear it down so that another form of
  civilisation can endure (or none will). This implies that climate militancy
  would have to be articulated to a wider anti-capitalist groundswell, much as
  in earlier shifts of modes of production, when physical attacks on ruling
  classes formed only minor parts of societywide reorganisation. How could that
  happen? This cannot be known beforehand. It can be found out only through
  immersion in practice.
