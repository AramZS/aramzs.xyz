  Tong and his colleagues estimated that committed emissions from
  already-running power plants – not counting extraction, transportation,
  deforestation – would be enough to take the world beyond 1.5°C. Combined with
  proposed plants, they would nearly exhaust the budget for the amount of carbon
  that can be released while still giving the world some chance of staying below
  2°C.
