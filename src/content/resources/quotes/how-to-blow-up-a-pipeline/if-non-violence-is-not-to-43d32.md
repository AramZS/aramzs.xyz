  If non-violence is not to be treated as a holy covenant or rite, then one must
  adopt the explicitly anti-Gandhian position of Mandela: ‘I called for
  non-violent protest for as long as it was effective’, as ‘a tactic that should
  be abandoned when it no longer worked.’ Strategic pacifism turns this method
  into a fetish, outside of history, unrelated to time.
