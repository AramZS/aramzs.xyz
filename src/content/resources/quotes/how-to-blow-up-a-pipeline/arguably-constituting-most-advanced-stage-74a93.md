  Arguably constituting the most advanced stage of the climate struggle in
  Europe, Ende Gelände spanned the cycles and grew year on year; in the summer
  of 2019, 6,000 people closed the largest point source of emissions in Germany,
  backed up by several thousands more in the camp and some 40,000 in a Fridays
  for Future demonstration. By that time, Ende Gelände had forced the issue of
  brown coal to the top of the agenda and prompted a national commission to set
  a date for phasing it out – the date eventually announced as 2038. That’s
  another two decades of churning out coal. Hence Ende Gelände promised to march
  on and swell further and spawn more copycats around Europe; in 2019, dozens of
  climate camps were organised from Poland to Portugal. The learning curve went
  steadily upwards.
