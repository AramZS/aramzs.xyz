  McKinnon, has argued in the article ‘Climate Change: Against Despair’, a
  delightful logical evisceration of the fatalist position, it often comes down
  to a probability assessment. While some climate fatalists deny that it would
  be logically and technically possible to cut emissions to zero and then begin
  the work of repair and regeneration, more common is the argument that this
  just won’t happen, because of the way the world is. Scranton at one point
  acknowledges that it could be accomplished, if we managed to ‘radically
  reorient all human economic and social production, a task that is scarcely
  imaginable, much less feasible. It would demand centralized control of key
  economic sectors, massive state investment in carbon capture and
  sequestration, and global coordination on a scale never seen before’ – a
  scenario that can be conjured up in some theoretical hemisphere of the mind
  but not promoted or implemented in the real world, because the forces stacked
  against it are so stupefyingly strong. Despair about the climate is here based
  on a judgement of extreme improbability, hypostatised into impossibility. The
  procedure is anti-political through and through.
