  Jonathan Franzen, a rather more senior member of the American literary
  pantheon. From his pulpit in the New Yorker, he has periodically held forth on
  how unwise it is to attempt to have climate change abated. Like Scranton, he
  believes that ‘planetary overheating is a done deal’. As his evidence, he
  points to the fact that ‘no head of state has ever made a commitment to
  leaving any carbon in the ground’. Before the 1790s, no head of a state had
  ever made a commitment to freeing African slaves; in July 1791, someone of
  Franzen’s disposition could have argued, on these grounds alone, that eternal
  slavery is a done deal.
