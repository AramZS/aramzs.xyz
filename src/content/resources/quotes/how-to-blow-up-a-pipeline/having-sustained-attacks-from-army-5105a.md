  Having sustained attacks from the army, government thugs, the civil police and
  the secret police known as SAVAK for months, the mobilised masses
  ‘aggressively struck back at the armed forces’ in the autumn of 1978. In Amol,
  they equipped themselves with bows and poisoned arrows, overwhelmed the
  garrisons and seized their weapons; in Dezful, they dropped bags of sand on
  patrolling soldiers, who were then jumped upon and disarmed; in Hamadan, they
  burnt down government buildings until the city ‘came to resemble an ancient
  ruin’;
