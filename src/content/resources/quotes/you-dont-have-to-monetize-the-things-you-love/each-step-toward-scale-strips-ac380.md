  each step toward scale strips away the qualities that made the original
  valuable: the intimate knowledge of neighbors, the trust built over the years,
  the inside jokes, the familiar dishes, the comfortable silences. The scaled
  version might be successful by certain metrics, but it would be a
  fundamentally different thing.
