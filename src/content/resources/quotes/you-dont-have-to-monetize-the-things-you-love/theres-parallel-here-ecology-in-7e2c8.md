  There’s a parallel here with ecology. In natural systems, not every organism
  aims to dominate its environment. Some species remain in narrow niches,
  perfectly adapted to specific conditions. They thrive, not despite their
  limitations, but because of them.

  Human creative and social endeavors don’t all need to compete for maximum
  reach. A writing group that’s met in the same coffee shop for a decade might
  be exactly as big as it should be. A small-batch pottery studio producing just
  enough to sustain its owner’s modest needs might be operating at its optimal
  scale.

  These bounded endeavors serve another crucial function: they act as
  counterweights to the increasingly automated, optimized, and scaled nature of
  modern life.
