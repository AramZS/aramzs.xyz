overview: >-
  Agents J and K are back...in time. J has seen some inexplicable things in his
  15 years with the Men in Black, but nothing, not even aliens, perplexes him as
  much as his wry, reticent partner. But when K's life and the fate of the
  planet are put at stake, Agent J will have to travel back in time to put
  things right. J discovers that there are secrets to the universe that K never
  told him - secrets that will reveal themselves as he teams up with the young
  Agent K to save his partner, the agency, and the future of humankind.
