overview: >-
  Max and Annie's weekly game night gets kicked up a notch when Max's brother
  Brooks arranges a murder mystery party -- complete with fake thugs and federal
  agents. So when Brooks gets kidnapped, it's all supposed to be part of the
  game. As the competitors set out to solve the case, they start to learn that
  neither the game nor Brooks are what they seem to be. The friends soon find
  themselves in over their heads as each twist leads to another unexpected turn
  over the course of one chaotic night.
