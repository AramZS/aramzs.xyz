Honestly, a movie about a tech mogul who aims to use the global internet to make the real world a worse place, so that people will spend all their time in a virtual world where they will use an alternate infrastructure pushed on them to the profit of the tech mogul, while gaming up with an influencer with religious overtones, feels so ahead of its time as a plot that it's only making sense right this moment. Also, pretty good special effects and a nice job ripping off the Jurassic Park theme.
