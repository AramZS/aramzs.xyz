overview: >-
  By 2017, the global economy has collapsed and U.S. society has become a
  totalitarian police state, censoring all cultural activity. The government
  pacifies the populace by broadcasting a number of game shows in which
  convicted criminals fight for their lives, including the gladiator-style The
  Running Man, hosted by the ruthless Damon Killian, where “runners” attempt to
  evade “stalkers” and certain death for a chance to be pardoned and set free.
