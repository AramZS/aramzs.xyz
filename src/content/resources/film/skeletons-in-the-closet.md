overview: >-
  Skeletons in the Closet is a late-night, horror anthology television series
  featuring The Widow and her dead husband, Charlie. Each episode finds them
  providing hilarious commentary on a variety of B-movie horror films - some of
  which are terrifying! Their number one fan, a precocious 11-year-old named
  Jamie, never misses an episode. With her parents out for the evening, Jamie
  sits down in front of the tube to devour the delectable terror, but her
  favorite Friday night freak show is constantly interrupted by her annoying new
  babysitter, Tina. If they can survive each other, they may be able to survive
  the night!

Having two characters sarcastically comment on how stupid and confusing your movie is doesn't make it a good movie.
