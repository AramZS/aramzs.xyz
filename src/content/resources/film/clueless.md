overview: >-
  Shallow, rich and socially successful Cher is at the top of her Beverly Hills
  high school's pecking scale. Seeing herself as a matchmaker, Cher first coaxes
  two teachers into dating each other. Emboldened by her success, she decides to
  give hopelessly klutzy new student Tai a makeover. When Tai becomes more
  popular than she is, Cher realizes that her disapproving ex-stepbrother was
  right about how misguided she was -- and falls for him.
