overview: >-
  Charlie Croker pulled off the crime of a lifetime. The one thing that he
  didn't plan on was being double-crossed. Along with a drop-dead gorgeous
  safecracker, Croker and his team take off to re-steal the loot and end up in a
  pulse-pounding, pedal-to-the-metal chase that careens up, down, above and
  below the streets of Los Angeles.
