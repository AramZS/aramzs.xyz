overview: >-
  Lily is a typical 150-year-old lovelorn vampire who's looking for the man of
  her nightmares -- until she lays her eyes on Herman, a 7-foot-tall green
  experiment with a heart of gold. It's love at first shock as these two ghouls
  fall fangs over feet for each other in a Transylvanian romance. Unfortunately,
  it's not all smooth sailing in the cemetery as Lily's father has other plans
  for his beloved daughter's future, and they don't involve her new bumbling
  beau.
