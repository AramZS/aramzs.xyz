overview: >-
  The Gardner family moves to a remote farmstead in rural New England to escape
  the hustle of the 21st century. They are busy adapting to their new life when
  a meteorite crashes into their front yard, melts into the earth, and infects
  both the land and the properties of space-time with a strange, otherworldly
  colour. To their horror, the family discovers this alien force is gradually
  mutating every life form that it touchesâ€”including them.
