overview: >-
  Friends and fledgling entrepreneurs invent a device in their garage which
  reduces the apparent mass of any object placed inside it, but they discover
  that it has some highly unexpected capabilities - ones that could enable them
  to do and to have seemingly anything they want. Taking advantage of this
  unique opportunity is the first challenge they face. Dealing with the
  consequences is the next.
