overview: >-
  Determined to keep Annabelle from wreaking more havoc, demonologists Ed and
  Lorraine Warren bring the possessed doll to the locked artifacts room in their
  home, placing her “safely” behind sacred glass and enlisting a priest’s holy
  blessing. But an unholy night of horror awaits as Annabelle awakens the evil
  spirits in the room, who all set their sights on a new target—the Warrens'
  ten-year-old daughter, Judy, and her friends.
