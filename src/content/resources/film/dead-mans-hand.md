"I wish I had a bulletproof heart"

Me too end credits. There's a lot of people really trying in this, but it really does not come together. I'm giving extra credit here because I like the idea of using style, camerawork and editing to make it look like a spegetti western and I can tell they're trying for it, but they leaned a little too much on editing tools to do it and doesn't quite work.
