Man... are the 2020s the decade where Marvel actually leverages all this crazy multi-platform TV and Movies stuff to orchestrate some lengthy character arcs that really hit with a long windup followed by a hell of an emotional punch? 

Also... did this TV show retroactively make the Black Widow film way better? 

Unexpectedly great!
