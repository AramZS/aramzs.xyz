overview: >-
  While staying at an isolated island resort, James and Em are enjoying a
  perfect vacation of pristine beaches, exceptional staff, and soaking up the
  sun. But guided by the seductive and mysterious Gabi, they venture outside the
  resort grounds and find themselves in a culture filled with violence,
  hedonism, and untold horror. A tragic accident leaves them facing a zero
  tolerance policy for crime: either you'll be executed, or, if youâ€™re rich
  enough to afford it, you can watch yourself die instead.
