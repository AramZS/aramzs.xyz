overview: >-
  In the year 2159, two classes of people exist: the very wealthy who live on a
  pristine man-made space station called Elysium, and the rest, who live on an
  overpopulated, ruined Earth. Secretary Rhodes, a hard line government ofﬁcial,
  will stop at nothing to enforce anti-immigration laws and preserve the
  luxurious lifestyle of the citizens of Elysium. That doesn’t stop the people
  of Earth from trying to get in, by any means they can. When unlucky Max is
  backed into a corner, he agrees to take on a daunting mission that, if
  successful, will not only save his life, but could bring equality to these
  polarized worlds.
