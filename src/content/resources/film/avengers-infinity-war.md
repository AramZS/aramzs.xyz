overview: >-
  As the Avengers and their allies have continued to protect the world from
  threats too large for any one hero to handle, a new danger has emerged from
  the cosmic shadows: Thanos. A despot of intergalactic infamy, his goal is to
  collect all six Infinity Stones, artifacts of unimaginable power, and use them
  to inflict his twisted will on all of reality. Everything the Avengers have
  fought for has led up to this moment - the fate of Earth and existence itself
  has never been more uncertain.
