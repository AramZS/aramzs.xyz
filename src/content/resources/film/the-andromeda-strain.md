overview: >-
  When virtually all of the residents of Piedmont, New Mexico, are found dead
  after the return to Earth of a space satellite, the head of the US Air Force's
  Project Scoop declares an emergency. A group of eminent scientists led by Dr.
  Jeremy Stone scramble to a secure laboratory and try to first isolate the life
  form while determining why two people from Piedmont - an old alcoholic and a
  six-month-old baby - survived. The scientists methodically study the alien
  life form unaware that it has already mutated and presents a far greater
  danger in the lab, which is equipped with a nuclear self-destruct device
  designed to prevent the escape of dangerous biological agents.
