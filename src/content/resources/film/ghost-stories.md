overview: >-
  Professor Phillip Goodman devotes his life to exposing phony psychics and
  fraudulent supernatural shenanigans. His skepticism soon gets put to the test
  when he receives news of three chilling and inexplicable cases -- disturbing
  visions in an abandoned asylum, a car accident deep in the woods and the
  spirit of an unborn child. Even scarier -- each of the macabre stories seems
  to have a sinister connection to the professor's own life.
