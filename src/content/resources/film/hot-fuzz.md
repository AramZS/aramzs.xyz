overview: >-
  Former London constable Nicholas Angel finds it difficult to adapt to his new
  assignment in the sleepy British village of Sandford. Not only does he miss
  the excitement of the big city, but he also has a well-meaning oaf for a
  partner. However, when a series of grisly accidents rocks Sandford, Angel
  smells something rotten in the idyllic village.
