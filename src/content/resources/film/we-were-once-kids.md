overview: >-
  In the early nineties, before the massive gentrification of many of New York's
  then slums, several young people from very disparate backgrounds left their
  broken homes and ventured onto the brutal streets of the city. United by their
  love of skateboarding, they formed a family and built a unique lifestyle that
  eventually inspired Kids, a groundbreaking and outrageous film directed by
  photographer Larry Clark and released in 1995.
