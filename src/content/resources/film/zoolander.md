overview: >-
  Clear the runway for Derek Zoolander, VH1's three-time male model of the year.
  His face falls when hippie-chic Hansel scooters in to steal this year's award.
  The evil fashion guru Mugatu seizes the opportunity to turn Derek into a
  killing machine. It's a well-designed conspiracy and only with the help of
  Hansel and a few well-chosen accessories like Matilda can Derek make the world
  safe for male models everywhere.
