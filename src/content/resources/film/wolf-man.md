  With his marriage fraying, Blake persuades his wife Charlotte to take a break
  from the city and visit his remote childhood home in rural Oregon. As they

  transforming into something unrecognizable.

I don't know what went wrong exactly to make this so boring, but it's some combination of bad editing, bad coloring and acting that's just too 'realistic' to keep my attention.
