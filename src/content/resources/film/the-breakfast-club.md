overview: >-
  Five high school students from different walks of life endure a Saturday
  detention under a power-hungry principal. The disparate group includes rebel
  John, princess Claire, outcast Allison, brainy Brian and Andrew, the jock.
  Each has a chance to tell his or her story, making the others see them a
  little differently -- and when the day ends, they question whether school will
  ever be the same.
