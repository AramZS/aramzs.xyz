The way this ended I now want Suki Waterhouse to wander America, the woman with no name. Every week she encounters a new mystery and ghost and must solve the case, beat up the bad guy and amble out of town at the end, staying one step ahead of the law which wishes to unfairly imprison her while trying to clear her name and return to her beloved girlfriend.
