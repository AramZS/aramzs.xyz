overview: >-
  When a ruptured water main creates an enormous sinkhole right in front of
  Bob's Burgers, it blocks the entrance indefinitely and ruins the Belchersâ€™
  plans for a successful summer. While Bob and Linda struggle to keep the
  business afloat, the kids try to solve a mystery that could save their
  family's restaurant. As the dangers mount, these underdogs help each other
  find hope and fight to get back behind the counter, where they belong.
