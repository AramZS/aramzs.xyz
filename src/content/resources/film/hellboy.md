overview: >-
  In the final days of World War II, the Nazis attempt to use black magic to aid
  their dying cause. The Allies raid the camp where the ceremony is taking
  place, but not before they summon a baby demon who is rescued by Allied forces
  and dubbed "Hellboy". Sixty years later, Hellboy serves the cause of good
  rather than evil as an agent in the Bureau of Paranormal Research & Defense,
  along with Abe Sapien - a merman with psychic powers, and Liz Sherman - a
  woman with pyrokinesis, protecting America against dark forces.
