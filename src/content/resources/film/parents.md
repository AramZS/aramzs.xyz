overview: >-
  More and more parents take competitive behavior towards the teachers of their
  children: deny votes and programs, vaneggiano of likes, dislikes, and
  conspiracies. So, instead of helping in the training of their children, they
  become insurmountable obstacles to their growth. Presumptuously they think:
  "We know better than anyone else our children and we know what they are worth
  and how and what you have to teach."
