overview: >-
  Tales From The Lodge is a fresh take on the portmanteau horror-comedy genre.
  An isolated lodge somewhere in England. Five old university pals, now nudging
  40, gather for a weekend to scatter the ashes of their friend, Jonesy, who
  drowned himself in the lake three years earlier. They settle in for a fun
  evening, entertaining each other with stories of murders, ghosts, zombies and
  possessions, but as day turns to night, the gang become aware of another
  horror story unfolding around them - And this one is real.
