overview: >-
  The fate of the galaxy rests in the hands of bitter rivals. One, James Kirk,
  is a delinquent, thrill-seeking Iowa farm boy. The other, Spock, a Vulcan, was
  raised in a logic-based society that rejects all emotion. As fiery instinct
  clashes with calm reason, their unlikely but powerful partnership is the only
  thing capable of leading their crew through unimaginable danger, boldly going
  where no one has gone before. The human adventure has begun again.
