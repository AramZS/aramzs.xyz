I think this is fun! Occasionally heavy-handed, but clever, intentional, interesting directorial choices that work well with the solid acting. Fun to see some new feeling interesting ideas; and the story gestures at lore and cosmology within its universe that give you room to think and even create space for interesting follow-ups without forcing dumb cliffhangers. It doesn't need a sequel, but in the world of horror it's a better candidate then most. Good stuff!
