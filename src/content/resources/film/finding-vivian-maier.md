overview: >-
  Vivian Maier's photos were seemingly destined for obscurity, lost among the
  clutter of the countless objects she'd collected throughout her life. Instead
  these images have shaken the world of street photography and irrevocably
  changed the life of the man who brought them to the public eye. This film
  brings to life the interesting turns and travails of the improbable saga of
  John Maloof's discovery of Vivian Maier, unravelling this mysterious tale
  through her documentary films, photographs, odd collections and personal
  accounts from the people that knew her. What started as a blog to show her
  work quickly became a viral sensation in the photography world. Photos
  destined for the trash heap now line gallery exhibitions, a forthcoming book
  and this documentary film.
