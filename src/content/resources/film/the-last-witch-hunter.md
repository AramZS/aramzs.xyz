overview: >-
  The modern world holds many secrets, but by far the most astounding is that
  witches still live among us; vicious supernatural creatures intent on
  unleashing the Black Death upon the world and putting an end to the human race
  once and for all. Armies of witch hunters have battled this unnatural enemy
  for centuries, including Kaulder, a valiant warrior who many years ago slayed
  the all-powerful Witch Queen, decimating her followers in the process. In the
  moments right before her death, the Queen cursed Kaulder with immortality,
  forever separating him from his beloved wife and daughter. Today, Kaulder is
  the last living hunter who has spent his immortal life tracking down rogue
  witches, all the while yearning for his long-lost family.
