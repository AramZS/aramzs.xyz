overview: >-
  Owen and Isabel's love story simmers with spiteful rage and unfortunately for
  everyone, Isabel is pregnant with Owen's child. To prove to her that he can
  become a stable father, Owen agrees to reconnect with his only living
  relatives at Isabel's request. The couple take a trip to visit his perversely
  devoted grandmother and his sister Pearl, who was severely burned in a fire,
  to finally bury the hatchet. But sometimes the ties that bind can cut off all
  circulation.
