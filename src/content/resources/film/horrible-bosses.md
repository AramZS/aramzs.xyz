overview: >-
  For Nick, Kurt and Dale, the only thing that would make the daily grind more
  tolerable would be to grind their intolerable bosses into dust. Quitting is
  not an option, so, with the benefit of a few-too-many drinks and some dubious
  advice from a hustling ex-con, the three friends devise a convoluted and
  seemingly foolproof plan to rid themselves of their respective employers...
  permanently.
