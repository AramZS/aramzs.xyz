overview: >-
  What started out as an inside joke amongst two self proclaimed weirdos in Ft.
  Worth, Texas soon becomes much more than they bargained for. Frustrated by the
  rising consumer-driven culture, out-of-work pals Douglass St. Clair Smith and
  Steve Wilcox decide to turn their conservative southern ideology on its head
  and invent a new religion all their own. Spurred on by the overreach of
  religion and zealous televangelists of the day, the pair concoct religious
  monikers (Reverend Ivan Stang and Dr. Philo Drummond), a newly minted prophet
  (J.R. "Bob" Dobbs), and devise a crusade to expose the conspiracy of normalcy
  by using humor as the ultimate weapon.
