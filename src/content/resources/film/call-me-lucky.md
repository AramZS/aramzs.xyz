overview: >-
  An inspiring, triumphant and wickedly funny portrait of one of comedy’s most
  enigmatic and important figures, CALL ME LUCKY tells the story of Barry
  Crimmins, a beer-swilling, politically outspoken and whip-smart comic whose
  efforts in the 70s and 80s fostered the talents of the next generation of
  standup comedians. But beneath Crimmins’ gruff, hard-drinking, curmudgeonly
  persona lay an undercurrent of rage stemming from his long-suppressed and
  horrific abuse as a child – a rage that eventually found its way out of the
  comedy clubs and television shows and into the political arena.
