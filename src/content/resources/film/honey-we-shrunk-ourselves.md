overview: >-
  The joke's on absent-minded scientist Wayne Szalinski when his troublesome
  invention shrinks him, his brother and their wives so effectively that their
  children think they've completely disappeared. Of course, this gives the kids
  free rein to do anything they want, unaware that their parents are watching
  every move.
