Look it's pretty good. It could be better, they could have cleared some of the fight time to make more room for character work. The villain especially could have done with some more background, though I appreciate the meta of having Susan Sarandon play a lean-in lady CEO with a long history in the military-industrial complex. A lot of the good you'll get out of this movie is absolutely dependent on how much meta stuff you came in with. But the end, though perhaps not totally earned, really picked up a lot.
