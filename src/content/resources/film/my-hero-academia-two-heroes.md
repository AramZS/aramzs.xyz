overview: >-
  All Might and Deku accept an invitation to go abroad to a floating and mobile
  manmade city, called 'I-Island', where they research quirks as well as hero
  supplemental items at the special 'I-Expo' convention that is currently being
  held on the island. During that time, suddenly, despite an iron wall of
  security surrounding the island, the system is breached by a villain, and the
  only ones able to stop him are the students of Class 1-A.
