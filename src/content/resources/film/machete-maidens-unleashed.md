overview: >-
  In the final decades of the 20th century, the Philippines was a country where
  low-budget exploitation-film producers were free to make nearly any kind of
  movie they wanted, any way they pleased. It was a country with extremely lax
  labor regulations and a very permissive attitude towards cultural expression.
  As a result, it became a hotbed for the production of cheapie movies. Their
  history and the genre itself are detailed in this breezy, nostalgic
  documentary.
