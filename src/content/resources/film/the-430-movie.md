I love that in this phase of his life Kevin Smith is making sweet, nice, emotionally genuine films. I like it for him and I like watching them. He's not breaking any mold, or doing crazy innovative stuff here, it's just small, kind, and a chance for him to pull his family and friends together and have fun; and that's what it feels like. I like it!
