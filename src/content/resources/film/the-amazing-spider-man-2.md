  For Peter Parker, life is busy. Between taking out the bad guys as Spider-Man
  and spending time with the person he loves, Gwen Stacy, high school graduation
  cannot come quickly enough. Peter has not forgotten about the promise he made
  to Gwenâ€™s father to protect her by staying away, but that is a promise he
  cannot keep. Things will change for Peter when a new villain, Electro,
  emerges, an old friend, Harry Osborn, returns, and Peter uncovers new clues
  about his past.
