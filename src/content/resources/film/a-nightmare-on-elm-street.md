overview: >-
  Teenagers in a small town are dropping like flies, apparently in the grip of
  mass hysteria causing their suicides. A cop's daughter, Nancy Thompson, traces
  the cause to child molester Fred Krueger, who was burned alive by angry
  parents many years before. Krueger has now come back in the dreams of his
  killers' children, claiming their lives as his revenge. Nancy and her
  boyfriend, Glen, must devise a plan to lure the monster out of the realm of
  nightmares and into the real world...
