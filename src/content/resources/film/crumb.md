overview: >-
  This movie chronicles the life and times of R. Crumb. Robert Crumb is the
  cartoonist/artist who drew Keep On Truckin', Fritz the Cat, and played a major
  pioneering role in the genesis of underground comix. Through interviews with
  his mother, two brothers, wife, and ex-girlfriends, as well as selections from
  his vast quantity of graphic art, we are treated to a darkly comic ride
  through one man's subconscious mind.
