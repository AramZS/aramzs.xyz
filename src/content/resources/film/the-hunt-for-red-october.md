original_title: The Hunt for Red October
overview: >-
  A new technologically-superior Soviet nuclear sub, the Red October, is heading
  for the U.S. coast under the command of Captain Marko Ramius. The American
  government thinks Ramius is planning to attack. Lone CIA analyst Jack Ryan has
  a different idea: he thinks Ramius is planning to defect, but he has only a
  few hours to find him and prove it - because the entire Russian naval and air
  commands are trying to find Ramius, too. The hunt is on!
