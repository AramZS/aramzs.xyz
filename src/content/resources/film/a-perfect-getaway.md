overview: >-
  For their honeymoon, newlyweds Cliff and Cydney head to the tropical islands
  of Hawaii. While journeying through the paradisaical countryside the couple
  encounters Kale and Cleo, two disgruntled hitchhikers and Nick and Gina, two
  wild but well-meaning spirits who help guide them through the lush jungles.
  The picturesque waterfalls and scenic mountainsides quickly give way to terror
  when Cliff and Cydney learn of a grisly murder that occurred nearby and
  realize that they're being followed by chance acquaintances that suspiciously
  fit the description of the killers.
