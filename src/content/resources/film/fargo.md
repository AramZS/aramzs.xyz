overview: >-
  Jerry, a small-town Minnesota car salesman is bursting at the seams with
  debt... but he's got a plan. He's going to hire two thugs to kidnap his wife
  in a scheme to collect a hefty ransom from his wealthy father-in-law. It's
  going to be a snap and nobody's going to get hurt... until people start dying.
  Enter Police Chief Marge, a coffee-drinking, parka-wearing - and extremely
  pregnant - investigator who'll stop at nothing to get her man. And if you
  think her small-time investigative skills will give the crooks a run for their
  ransom... you betcha!
