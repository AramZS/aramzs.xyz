overview: >-
  In response to political pressure from Senator Lillian DeHaven, the U.S. Navy
  begins a program that would allow for the eventual integration of women into
  its combat services. The program begins with a single trial candidate,
  Lieutenant Jordan O'Neil, who is chosen specifically for her femininity.
  O'Neil enters the grueling Navy SEAL training program under the command of
  Master Chief John James Urgayle, who unfairly pushes O'Neil until her
  determination wins his respect.

This movie does a lot better than I thought it would, but the final action sequence is shot extremely weird at some parts, I'm not sure why they thought the camera zooming in and out like that was a good idea? I think maybe they were trying to figure out something like shaky-cam but it didn't work so well here. I can imagine the shaky-cam version working, but the oscillation in and out, over and over, at the end doesn't work for me.
