overview: >-
  Every child comes into the world full of promise, and none more so than
  Chappie: he is gifted, special, a prodigy. Like any child, Chappie will come
  under the influence of his surroundings—some good, some bad—and he will rely
  on his heart and soul to find his way in the world and become his own man. But
  there's one thing that makes Chappie different from any one else: he is a
  robot.
