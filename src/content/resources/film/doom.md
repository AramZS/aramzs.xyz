overview: >-
  A team of space marines known as the Rapid Response Tactical Squad, led by
  Sarge, is sent to a science facility on Mars after somebody reports a security
  breach. There, they learn that the alert came after a test subject, a mass
  murderer purposefully injected with alien DNA, broke free and began killing
  people. Dr. Grimm, who is related to team member Reaper, informs them all that
  the chromosome can mutate humans into monsters -- and is highly infectious.
