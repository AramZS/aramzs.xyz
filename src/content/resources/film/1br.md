  When Sarah lucks into a sweet one-bedroom at Asilo Del Mar Apartments in Los
  Angeles, she thinks she's hit the jackpot. It's got plenty of space, friendly
  tenants, group BBQs and even a cute neighbour next door. All is not what it
  seems: loud noises start keeping her awake at night; her cat is missing;
  everyone seems to be a little too helpful and friendly, except for the weirdo,
  Lester. Soon, Sarah learns she didn't choose this apartment â€” it chose her.
