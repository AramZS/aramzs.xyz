overview: >-
  After learning that a boy their age has been accidentally killed near their
  rural homes, four Oregon boys decide to go see the body. On the way, Gordie, 
  Vern, Chris and Teddy encounter a mean junk man and a marsh full of leeches,
  as they also learn more about one another and their very different home lives.
  Just a lark at first, the boys' adventure evolves into a defining event in
  their lives.
