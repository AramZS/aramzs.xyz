overview: >-
  Columbus has made a habit of running from what scares him. Tallahassee doesn't
  have fears. If he did, he'd kick their ever-living ass. In a world overrun by
  zombies, these two are perfectly evolved survivors. But now, they're about to
  stare down the most terrifying prospect of all: each other.
