overview: >-
  A team from the intergalactic fast food chain Crumb's Crunchy Delights
  descends on Earth, planning to make human flesh the newest taste sensation.
  After they wipe out the New Zealand town Kaihoro, the country’s
  Astro-Investigation and Defense Service (AIaDS) is called in to deal with the
  problem. Things are complicated due to Giles, an aid worker who comes to
  Kaihoro the same day to collect change from the residents. He is captured by
  the aliens, and AIaDS stages a rescue mission that quickly becomes an all-out
  assault on the aliens’ headquarters.
