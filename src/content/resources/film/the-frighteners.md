overview: >-
  Once an architect, Frank Bannister now passes himself off as an exorcist of
  evil spirits. To bolster his facade, he claims his "special" gift is the
  result of a car accident that killed his wife. But what he does not count on
  is more people dying in the small town where he lives. As he tries to piece
  together the supernatural mystery of these killings, he falls in love with the
  wife of one of the victims and deals with a crazy FBI agent.
