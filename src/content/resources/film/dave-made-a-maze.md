overview: >-
  Dave, an artist who has yet to complete anything significant in his career,
  builds a fort in his living room out of pure frustration, only to wind up
  trapped by the fantastical pitfalls, booby traps, and critters of his own
  creation. Ignoring his warnings, Daveâ€™s girlfriend Annie leads a band of
  oddball explorers on a rescue mission. Once inside, they find themselves
  trapped in an ever-changing supernatural world, threatened by booby traps and
  pursued by a bloodthirsty Minotaur.
