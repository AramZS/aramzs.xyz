overview: >-
  When an asteroid threatens to collide with Earth, NASA honcho Dan Truman
  determines the only way to stop it is to drill into its surface and detonate a
  nuclear bomb. This leads him to renowned driller Harry Stamper, who agrees to
  helm the dangerous space mission provided he can bring along his own hotshot
  crew. Among them is the cocksure A.J. who Harry thinks isn't good enough for
  his daughter, until the mission proves otherwise.
