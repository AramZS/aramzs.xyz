It's not so much that this movie is bad, it's mechanically fine. It is just slow and filled with empty spaces and unmotivated dream sequences. The movie seems on the cusp of having a better plot, or a more thought out point, but instead it uses the arty horror techniques of a typical A24 film to cover its own lack of a real point or theme. It's a shame because most of the parts are there, a slight tweak might make it clearer, or more entertaining, or more interesting. Instead it has ended up as tone lacking a solid organizing idea.
