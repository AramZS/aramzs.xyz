I think this film sort of misses some major points of the original, much to its detriment. If you ever wonder what makes a movie "American" the difference between these two movies is it exactly. That said, on its own merits, the film is fun, effective at suspense, well-filmed and pulls some great performances, notably even from the kids--who have larger roles in this version. James McAvoy and Mackenzie Davis are really delivering too, and if you wanted to see it just for their performances I would not blame you. 

I am fascinated by the changes, especially to Scoot McNairy's character which change the context and tenor of the movie significantly and in some odd ways.
