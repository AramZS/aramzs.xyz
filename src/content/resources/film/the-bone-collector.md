overview: >-
  Lincoln Rhyme was the department's top homicide detective and leading expert
  in criminal forensics until an injury left him paralyzed, depressed, and
  incapable of working. But when a gruesome murder in Manhattan leaves
  detectives baffled, they call on Rhyme to help solve the mystery. Amelia
  Donaghy, a rookie cop whose quick thinking preserved a gruesome murder scene,
  is enlisted by Rhyme to be his on-the-scene forensics expert. With Amelia
  reluctantly acting as Rhyme's able-bodied go-between, the pair piece together
  cryptic clues the killer leaves behind at the scene of the crime, hoping to
  catch the grisly serial killer.
