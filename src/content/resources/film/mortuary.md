I'm amazed that no one has ever recommended this to me. Great acting, creepy decomposing urbanity, some very clever shots and Lovecraftian mold monsters. In many ways this reads ahead of its time, residing instead in the late aughts where the housing crash created dozens of decomposing suburbs like seen here, where populations could and did disappear for reasons unknown.
