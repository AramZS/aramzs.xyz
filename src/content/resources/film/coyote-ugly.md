overview: >-
  Graced with a velvet voice, 21-year-old Violet Sanford heads to New York to

  sidelined by the accolades and notoriety she receives at her "day" job as a
  barmaid at Coyote Ugly. The "Coyotes" as they are affectionately called
  tantalize customers and the media alike with their outrageous antics, making
