overview: >-
  Something sinister has come to the shores of Erin Island, unbeknownst to the
  quaint population of this sleepy fishing village resting somewhere off
  Ireland’s coast. First, some fishermen go missing. Then there is the rash of
  whale carcasses suddenly washing up on the beach. When the murders start, it’s
  up to two mismatched cops – an irresponsible alcoholic and his new partner, a
  by-the-book woman from the mainland – to protect the townsfolk from the giant,
  bloodsucking, tentacled aliens that prey upon them. Their only weapon, they
  discover, is booze. If they want to survive the creatures’ onslaught, everyone
  will have to get very, very drunk!
