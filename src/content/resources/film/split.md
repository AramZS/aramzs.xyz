overview: >-
  Though Kevin has evidenced 23 personalities to his trusted psychiatrist, Dr.
  Fletcher, there remains one still submerged who is set to materialize and
  dominate all the others. Compelled to abduct three teenage girls led by the
  willful, observant Casey, Kevin reaches a war for survival among all of those
  contained within him — as well as everyone around him — as the walls between
  his compartments shatter apart.
