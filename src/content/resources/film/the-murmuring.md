overview: >-
  This loosely plotted coming-of-age tale follows the life of 15-year-old
  Laurent Chevalier as he stumbles his way over the burgeoning swell of
  adolescence in 1950s France. After having his first sexual experience with a
  prostitute and dodging the lips of a priest, Chevalier contracts a case of
  scarlet fever. When the fever leaves him with a heart murmur, Chevalier is
  placed in a sanatorium, along with his over-attentive and adulterous mother.
