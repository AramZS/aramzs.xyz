overview: >-
  In a futuristic world where the polar ice caps have melted and made Earth a
  liquid planet, a beautiful barmaid rescues a mutant seafarer from a floating
  island prison. They escape, along with her young charge, Enola, and sail off
  aboard his ship. But the trio soon becomes the target of a menacing pirate who
  covets the map to 'Dryland'â€”which is tattooed on Enola's back.
