overview: >-
  A set of six nested stories spanning time between the 19th century and a
  distant post-apocalyptic future. Cloud Atlas explores how the actions and
  consequences of individual lives impact one another throughout the past, the
  present and the future. Action, mystery and romance weave through the story as
  one soul is shaped from a killer into a hero and a single act of kindness
  ripples across centuries to inspire a revolution in the distant future.  Based
  on the award winning novel by David Mitchell. Directed by Tom Tykwer and the
  Wachowskis.
