overview: >-
  Angela Baker escapes from a mental hospital and surfaces at a summer camp as a
  counselor who lectures her teenage charges on proper moral behavior. Those
  teens who break her strict rules -- from the camp chatterbox or a sex-obsessed
  girl to the boys who are peeping Toms -- are murdered by the impostor in
  various gruesome ways. As more campers go missing, intrepid counselor Molly
  begins to piece together the truth.
