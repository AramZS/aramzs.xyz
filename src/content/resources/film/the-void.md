overview: >-
  In the middle of a routine patrol, officer Daniel Carter happens upon a
  blood-soaked figure limping down a deserted stretch of road. He rushes the
  young man to a nearby rural hospital staffed by a skeleton crew, only to
  discover that patients and personnel are transforming into something inhuman.
  As the horror intensifies, Carter leads the other survivors on a hellish
  voyage into the subterranean depths of the hospital in a desperate bid to end
  the nightmare before it's too late.
