  Aging publisher Will Randall is at the end of his rope when a younger

  a wolf, Will suddenly finds himself full of youthful vigor. As he struggles to
  regain his position, he becomes enthralled with Laura Alden, his former boss's
  daughter. And, as increasingly animal-like urges begin to overwhelm him,
  Randall worries that he may be turning into the creature that bit him.
