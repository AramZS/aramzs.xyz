overview: >-
  In the future, America is a dystopian wasteland. The latest scourge is Ma-Ma,
  a prostitute-turned-drug pusher with a dangerous new drug and aims to take
  over the city. The only possibility of stopping her is an elite group of urban
  police called Judges, who combine the duties of judge, jury and executioner to
  deliver a brutal brand of swift justice. But even the top-ranking Judge,
  Dredd, discovers that taking down Ma-Ma isnâ€™t as easy as it seems in this
  explosive adaptation of the hugely popular comic series.
