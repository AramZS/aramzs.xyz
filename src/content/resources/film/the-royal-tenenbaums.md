overview: >-
  Royal Tenenbaum and his wife Etheline had three children and then they
  separated. All three children are extraordinary --- all geniuses. Virtually
  all memory of the brilliance of the young Tenenbaums was subsequently erased
  by two decades of betrayal, failure, and disaster. Most of this was generally
  considered to be their father's fault. "The Royal Tenenbaums" is the story of
  the family's sudden, unexpected reunion one recent winter.
