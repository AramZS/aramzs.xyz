I don't know if it's the edit or the script but this film is tripping all over itself. Things feel like they are happening out of order, characters feel like they're missing while scenes and the three "big reveals" are piled on top of each other, destroying the pacing of the third act. It's a shame too, because there are some decent special effects and I really liked the setting.
