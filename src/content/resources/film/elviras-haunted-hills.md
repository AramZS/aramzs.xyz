overview: >-
  The setting is Carpathia. The year is 1851. When Elvira gets kicked out of an
  Inn for a slight monetary discrepancy, she is rescued by a local who takes her
  to stay at the castle in the hills high above the village. The fact that she
  happens to resemble the count's former "missing" wife opens a can of worms or
  two.
