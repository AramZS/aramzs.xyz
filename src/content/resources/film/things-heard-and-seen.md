overview: >-
  Catherine Clare reluctantly trades life in 1980 Manhattan for a remote home in
  the tiny hamlet of Chosen, New York, after her husband George lands a job
  teaching art history at a small Hudson Valley college. Even as she does her
  best to transform the old dairy farm into a place where young daughter Franny
  will be happy, Catherine increasingly finds herself isolated and alone. She
  soon comes to sense a sinister darkness lurking both in the walls of the
  ramshackle propertyâ€”and in her marriage to George.

Accidentally watched this movie a second time and didn't realize until the mess kicked in. It is a film that asks you not to pay full attention to it and punishes you when you do. All the more frustrating because the first act and the last scene prove this could have been a lot better, which damns the film even worse.
