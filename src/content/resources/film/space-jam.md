overview: >-
  Jokes fly as the Tune Squad takes on the Nerdlucks in a hardcourt game to
  decide if the Looney Tunes remain here... or become attractions at a far-off
  galactic off-ramp called Moron Mountain. The Nerdlucks have a monstrous secret
  weapon: they've stolen the skills of top NBA stars like Charles Barkley and
  Patrick Ewing and become Monstars. But that's not all, folks. The Tune Squadâ€™s
  secret weapon just happens to be the finest player in this or any other
  universe. He's outta this world. So's the fun.
