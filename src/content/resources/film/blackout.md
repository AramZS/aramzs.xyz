overview: >-
  Small town artist Charley is a tortured man whose drinking binges blur with
  his sneaking suspicion that he might be a werewolf. He distances himself from
  those he loves and sinks deeper into solitude, as his flashes of memory of his
  grisly nighttime acts manifest themselves through his artwork.

Larry is always punching way over his budget. Some pieces of this are really remarkable. The animated scene about half way through is amazing. Some of the shots and transitions glow through the mundane bits to pull the whole film up into a great watch. The music is also a real standout here.
