A well-paced and well-put-together little film that is quite smartly executed for both directors' first feature film. What really pulled it over the top for me was some of the creativity in portraying the setting and a number of rather excellent performances, especially the two stars Sophie Lowe and Morgan Saylor; along with a typically great performance by Margo Martindale. If there was any major flaw it was that I would have liked more time with some of the other characters. Ended up enjoying it way more than I expected.
