overview: >-
  Two former rivals reconnect over drinks and a quick bite. One is compulsively
  running through men and can’t kick the habit of drinking their blood, and the
  other is working through her trauma and settling down with a new career in
  monster counseling. Things get a little uncomfortable when the conversation
  turns to the same toxic lover that connected them — Count Dracula — one of
  whom is still entangled with him.
