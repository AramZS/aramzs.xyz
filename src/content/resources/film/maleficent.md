overview: >-
  A beautiful, pure-hearted young woman, Maleficent has an idyllic life growing
  up in a peaceable forest kingdom, until one day when an invading army
  threatens the harmony of the land. She rises to be the land's fiercest
  protector, but she ultimately suffers a ruthless betrayal – an act that begins
  to turn her heart into stone. Bent on revenge, Maleficent faces an epic battle
  with the invading King's successor and, as a result, places a curse upon his
  newborn infant Aurora. As the child grows, Maleficent realizes that Aurora
  holds the key to peace in the kingdom – and to Maleficent's true happiness as
  well.
