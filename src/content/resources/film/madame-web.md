I don't understand how this movie could prominently get so much location information wrong. They keep saying people are in places that don't connect, don't exist, or don't make sense. I know that's the least of the issues here, but as a New Yorker it really irritated me they they couldn't do the basic work of pulling up Google Maps. It's just so lazy.
