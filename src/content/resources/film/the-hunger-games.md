overview: >-
  Every year in the ruins of what was once North America, the nation of Panem
  forces each of its twelve districts to send a teenage boy and girl to compete
  in the Hunger Games.  Part twisted entertainment, part government intimidation
  tactic, the Hunger Games are a nationally televised event in which “Tributes”
  must fight with one another until one survivor remains.  Pitted against
  highly-trained Tributes who have prepared for these Games their entire lives,
  Katniss is forced to rely upon her sharp instincts as well as the mentorship
  of drunken former victor Haymitch Abernathy.  If she’s ever to return home to
  District 12, Katniss must make impossible choices in the arena that weigh
  survival against humanity and life against love. The world will be watching.
