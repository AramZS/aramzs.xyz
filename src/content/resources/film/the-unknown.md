  On the lam, criminal Alonzo hides in the circus as The Armless Wonder â€“ a

  has concealed to hide his identity. Meanwhile, ringmaster's daughter Nanon has
  a phobia of being touched by men, but is romantically pursued by not only
  Alonzo but the strongman Malabar. Alonzo's desperation to remain with Nanon
  will only end in tragedy.
