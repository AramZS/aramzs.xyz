overview: >-
  Morioh, 1999—a normally quiet and peaceful town has recently become a hotbed
  of strange activity. Jōtarō Kūjō, now a marine biologist, heads to the
  mysterious town to meet Jōsuke Higashikata. While the two may seem like
  strangers at first, Jōsuke is actually the illegitimate child of Jōtarō's
  grandfather, Joseph Joestar. When they meet, Jōtarō realizes that he may have
  more in common with Jōsuke than just a blood relation. Along with the
  mild-mannered Kōichi Hirose and the boisterous Okuyasu Nijimura, the group
  dedicates themselves to investigating recent disappearances and other
  suspicious occurrences within Morioh. Aided by the power of Stands, the four
  men will encounter danger at every street corner, as it is up to them to
  unravel the town's secrets, before another occurs.
