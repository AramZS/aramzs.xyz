overview: >-
  Brave is set in the mystical Scottish Highlands, where Mérida is the princess
  of a kingdom ruled by King Fergus and Queen Elinor. An unruly daughter and an
  accomplished archer, Mérida one day defies a sacred custom of the land and
  inadvertently brings turmoil to the kingdom. In an attempt to set things
  right, Mérida seeks out an eccentric old Wise Woman and is granted an
  ill-fated wish. Also figuring into Mérida’s quest — and serving as comic
  relief — are the kingdom’s three lords: the enormous Lord MacGuffin, the surly
  Lord Macintosh, and the disagreeable Lord Dingwall.
