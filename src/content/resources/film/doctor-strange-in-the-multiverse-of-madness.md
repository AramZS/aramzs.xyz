Putting aside that this is the sort of deep cut victory lap for Marvel that would have been basically impossible even a mere 5 years ago; and putting aside the rewind on Wanda's character development; this was a fun movie! More fun then most of the Marvel films, more interesting to watch, and a genuinely decent use of Benedict Cumberbatch who I usually can't stand.
