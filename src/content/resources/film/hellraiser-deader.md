Apparently this was the film the producers wanted to make and then they threw together Hellworld to lock in the tax break? It makes sense, this feels a lot more like a real film with some surprisingly decent cinematography. It's a shame it's destroyed by an 'is she crazy, is this the asylum' sequence that's entirely unnecessary. Could have been Midnight Meat Train with Pinhead, ended up less then the sum of its parts.
