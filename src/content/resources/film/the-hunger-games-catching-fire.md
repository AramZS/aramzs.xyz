overview: >-
  Katniss Everdeen has returned home safe after winning the 74th Annual Hunger
  Games along with fellow tribute Peeta Mellark. Winning means that they must
  turn around and leave their family and close friends, embarking on a "Victor's
  Tour" of the districts. Along the way Katniss senses that a rebellion is
  simmering, but the Capitol is still very much in control as President Snow
  prepares the 75th Annual Hunger Games (The Quarter Quell) - a competition that
  could change Panem forever.
