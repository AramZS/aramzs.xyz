overview: >-
  The castle of Horní Staňkov. Camera enters the castle park. Approaching
  Kunstkamera, it stops at the emblem of Ouroboros above the entrance. The door
  opens, letting the camera in, to reveal the magical square with astrological
  figures of Virgo and Libra, combined with Dog and Lion from Chinese zodiac. A
  painting of Rudolf II as Vertumnus, more Arcimboldos. The camera continues to
  the main hall. A huge stone fireplace with ceramic statues. African fetishes,
  ritual masks, Bis poles and masks from Papua New Guinea, spiritualists´
  drawings, surrealistic photographs, and paintings etc. In this way, the whole
  Kunstkamera collection will be filmed. Time to time, as if by mistake, an
  object will appear in the shot, reminding of the fact that the place is
  inhabited.
