overview: >-
  Wreck-It Ralph is the 9-foot-tall, 643-pound villain of an arcade video game
  named Fix-It Felix Jr., in which the game's titular hero fixes buildings that
  Ralph destroys. Wanting to prove he can be a good guy and not just a villain,
  Ralph escapes his game and lands in Hero's Duty, a first-person shooter where
  he helps the game's hero battle against alien invaders. He later enters Sugar
  Rush, a kart racing game set on tracks made of candies, cookies and other
  sweets. There, Ralph meets Vanellope von Schweetz who has learned that her
  game is faced with a dire threat that could affect the entire arcade, and one
  that Ralph may have inadvertently started.
