overview: >-
  Charles Brady and his mother, Mary, are the last of a dying breed whose needs
  are not of this world.  They are Sleepwalkers - able to stay alive only by
  feeding on the life-force of the innocent, but destined to roam the earth,
  avoiding discovery while searching for their next victim.  That search takes
  them to the sleepy little town of Travis, Indiana, where beautiful teenager
  Tanya Robertson is about to become an unwilling pawn in their nightmarish
  fight for survival.
