overview: >-
  Roman (Lucky McKee) is a lonely young man who yearns to find love, happiness
  and companionship. Tormented by his ungrateful co-workers and trapped in a
  life of tedium as a welder in a local factory, Roman's one pleasure is his
  obsession with the elusive beauty (Kristen Bell) who lives in another
  apartment in his building complex. When a chance encounter with the young
  woman goes horribly wrong, a moment of frenzied desperation triggers a
  chilling turn of events leading to the girl's murder. As he teeters between
  deranged fantasy and cold reality, Roman's struggle to hide his grisly secret
  is further complicated by an eccentric neighbor named Eva (Nectar Rose) who
  develops an unlikely attraction to Roman and forces herself into his dark and
  tortured world.
