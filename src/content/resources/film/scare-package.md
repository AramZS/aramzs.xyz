overview: >-
  Chad Buckley is a horror aficionado, and he's lonely. Chad spends his days at
  his struggling genre video store arguing with his only regular customer, Sam.
  When an unsuspecting applicant shows up, Chad begins to teach him about the
  rules of horror and his video store at large, much to the chagrin of Sam.
  During Chad's on-boarding process, we weave in and out of different hilarious
  horror shorts, each one geared at a different set of horror tropes. As this
  new applicant learns the ropes, he begins to suspect Chad of something
  sinister, but we quickly learn that he may have a secret of his own.
