  Thirty years ago, aliens arrive on Earth. Not to conquer or give aid, but to

  area called District 9, the aliens are managed by Multi-National United, which
  is unconcerned with the aliens' welfare but will do anything to master their
  advanced technology. When a company field agent contracts a mysterious virus
