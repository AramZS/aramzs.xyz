overview: >-
  Shot in France, England, Switzerland and the United States, this documentary
  covers director Alejandro Jodorowsky (El Topo, Holy Mountain, Santa Sangre)
  and his 1974 Quixotic attempt to adapt the seminal sci-fi novel Dune into a
  feature film. After spending 2 years and millions of dollars, the massive
  undertaking eventually fell apart, but the artists Jodorowsky assembled for
  the legendary project continued to work together. This group of artists, or
  his “warriors” as Jodorowsky named them, went on to define modern sci-fi
  cinema with such films as Alien, Blade Runner, Star Wars and Total Recall.
