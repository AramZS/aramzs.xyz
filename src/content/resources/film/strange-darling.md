Really great acting, really well shot, but the plot suffers under some issues that screw with my suspension of disbelief. The framing of it as a true crime work creates some discordant portrayals where sympathies in the moment lie with, what feels later, like the wrong characters. The script also feels weirdly at times like it was written for two male leads and one of them was gender swapped, causing scenes where reactions feel wrong. Great music though!
