  Held in an L.A. interrogation room, Verbal Kint attempts to convince the feds
  that a mythic crime lord, Keyser Soze, not only exists, but was also
  responsible for drawing him and his four partners into a multi-million dollar
  heist that ended with an explosion in San Pedro harbor â€“ leaving few
  survivors. Verbal lures his interrogators with an incredible story of the
