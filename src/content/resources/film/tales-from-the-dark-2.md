overview: >-
  In "Haunted Pillow," TVB starlet Fala Chen is still obsessed with her lover
  (Gordon Lam) after their breakup and invariably suffers from insomnia. She
  gets hold of a Chinese herbal pillow that eventually helps her fall asleep
  again but it also draws her near something unexpected. "Hide And Seek" casts a
  group of young newcomers into an abandoned school campus where they meet
  longtime janitor Mr. Chan who takes shelter at the school. Playing
  hide-and-seek after midnight, the teenagers go missing, one after another. In
  his self-directed piece "Black Umbrella," Teddy Robin makes solving conflicts
  on the street at night his mission and marks each closed case with his
  signature black umbrella. Before he calls it a day, he meets a prostitute who
  forcefully pulls him upstairs for business and unfortunately things spiral out
  of control.
