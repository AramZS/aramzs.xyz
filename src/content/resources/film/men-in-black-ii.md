overview: >-
  Kay and Jay reunite to provide our best, last and only line of defense against
  a sinister seductress who levels the toughest challenge yet to the MIB's
  untarnished mission statement – protecting Earth from the scum of the
  universe. It's been four years since the alien-seeking agents averted an
  intergalactic disaster of epic proportions. Now it's a race against the clock
  as Jay must convince Kay – who not only has absolutely no memory of his time
  spent with the MIB, but is also the only living person left with the expertise
  to save the galaxy – to reunite with the MIB before the earth submits to
  ultimate destruction.
