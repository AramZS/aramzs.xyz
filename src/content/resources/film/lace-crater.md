overview: >-
  Opting to sleep in the allegedly-haunted guest house while spending a weekend
  in the Hamptons with friends, Ruth, a lonely young woman in her mid-twenties
  who's had too much to drink, strikes up a conversation that leads to a sexual
  encounter with Michael, a burlap-draped ghost that casually appears before
  her. Through this inter-paranormal relation, Ruth contracts an STD with
  alarming effects.
