overview: >-
  Beautiful Mandy Lane isn't a party girl but, when classmate Chloe invites the
  Texas high school student to a bash in the countryside, she reluctantly
  accepts. After hitching a ride with a vaguely scary older man, the teens
  arrive at their destination. Partying ensues, and Mandy's close pal, Emmet,
  keeps a watchful eye on the young males making a play for Mandy. Then two of
  the students are murdered.
