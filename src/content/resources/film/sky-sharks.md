overview: >-
  A team of Arctic geologists stumble across an abandoned laboratory in which
  the Nazis developed an incredible and brutal secret weapon during the final
  months of WW2. Deep in the ice, they accidentally awake a deadly army of
  flying zombie sharks ridden by genetically mutated, undead super-humans, who
  are unleashed into the skies, wreaking their bloodthirsty revenge on any
  aircraft that takes to the air. An elite task force is assembled to take on
  this deadly threat and stop the Sky Sharks from conquering the air, but as
  time runs out, the task force realises they will have to fight fire with fire,
  and the stage is set for the greatest flying super-mutant zombie shark air
  battle the world has ever seen....
