This has to be the most comic book movie I've ever seen. It isn't just the colors (which are wild) or the overall plot (which could be better, but has a bit of comic book ridiculousness). The bad guy has a full volcano full of hench people wearing matching leather super-suits and jetpacks staffing his monster-infested evil lair as he plans to sink the world. This movie has a weak start, but I like it more than the last one! The whole thing is like it came out of an alternate universe where instead of getting Christopher Nolan inspiring Zach Snyder we let Joel Schumacher inspire the next generation of super hero films. More movies that are *fun* please.

Also... I think this might be the first time I've liked Patrick Wilson in a film.
