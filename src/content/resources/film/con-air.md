  Newly-paroled former US Army ranger Cameron Poe is headed back to his wife,
  but must fly home aboard a prison transport flight dubbed "Jailbird" taking

  a new super-prison. Poe faces impossible odds when the transport plane is
  skyjacked mid-flight by the most vicious criminals in the country led by the
