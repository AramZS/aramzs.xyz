overview: >-
  Gellert Grindelwald has escaped imprisonment and has begun gathering followers
  to his causeâ€”elevating wizards above all non-magical beings. The only one
  capable of putting a stop to him is the wizard he once called his closest
  friend, Albus Dumbledore. However, Dumbledore will need to seek help from the
  wizard who had thwarted Grindelwald once before, his former student Newt
  Scamander, who agrees to help, unaware of the dangers that lie ahead. Lines
  are drawn as love and loyalty are tested, even among the truest friends and
  family, in an increasingly divided wizarding world.
