overview: >-
  Rejected by her lover, the only man left in Cheryl's life is the orphaned
  nephew she has raised as her own son. She'll stop at nothing to keep Billy
  with her. When her plans misfire, she is swept up into an insane frenzy that
  means death to anyone who comes between her and her obsession. But the
  investigating detective is convinced that Billy is the real killer - and
  determined to prove it. Madness and fanaticism work together to drag all
  concerned into a terrifying vortex of blood-letting that adds a nightmarish
  twist to the classic Oedipus story.
