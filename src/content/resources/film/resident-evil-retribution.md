overview: >-
  The Umbrella Corporation’s deadly T-virus continues to ravage the Earth,
  transforming the global population into legions of the flesh eating Undead.
  The human race’s last and only hope, Alice, awakens in the heart of Umbrella’s
  most clandestine operations facility and unveils more of her mysterious past
  as she delves further into the complex. Without a safe haven, Alice continues
  to hunt those responsible for the outbreak; a chase that takes her from Tokyo
  to New York, Washington, D.C. and Moscow, culminating in a mind-blowing
  revelation that will force her to rethink everything that she once thought to
  be true. Aided by new found allies and familiar friends, Alice must fight to
  survive long enough to escape a hostile world on the brink of oblivion. The
  countdown has begun.
