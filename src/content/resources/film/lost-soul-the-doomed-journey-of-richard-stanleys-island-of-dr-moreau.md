overview: >-
  The story of the insane scandals related to the remake of “Island of Dr.
  Moreau” —originally a novel by H. G. Wells—, which was brought to the big
  screen in 1996. How director Richard Stanley spent four years developing the
  project just to find an abrupt end to his work while leading actor Marlon
  Brando pulled the strings in the shadows. Now for the first time, the living
  key players recount what really happened and why it all went so spectacularly
  wrong.
