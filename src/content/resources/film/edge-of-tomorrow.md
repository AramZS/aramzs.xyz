overview: >-
  Major Bill Cage is an officer who has never seen a day of combat when he is
  unceremoniously demoted and dropped into combat. Cage is killed within
  minutes, managing to take an alpha alien down with him. He awakens back at the
  beginning of the same day and is forced to fight and die again... and again -
  as physical contact with the alien has thrown him into a time loop.
