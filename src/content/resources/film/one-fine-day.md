overview: >-
  Melanie Parker, an architect and mother of Sammy, and Jack Taylor, a newspaper
  columnist and father of Maggie, are both divorced. They meet one morning when
  overwhelmed Jack is left unexpectedly with Maggie and forgets that Melanie was
  to take her to school. As a result, both children miss their school field trip
  and are stuck with the parents. The two adults project their negative
  stereotypes of ex-spouses on each other, but end up needing to rely on each
  other to watch the children as each must save his job. Humor is added by
  Sammy's propensity for lodging objects in his nose and Maggie's tendency to
  wander.
