overview: >-
  This is not a film about gun control. It is a film about the fearful heart and
  soul of the United States, and the 280 million Americans lucky enough to have
  the right to a constitutionally protected Uzi. From a look at the Columbine
  High School security camera tapes to the home of Oscar-winning NRA President
  Charlton Heston, from a young man who makes homemade napalm with The
  Anarchist's Cookbook to the murder of a six-year-old girl by another
  six-year-old. Bowling for Columbine is a journey through the US, through our
  past, hoping to discover why our pursuit of happiness is so riddled with
  violence.
