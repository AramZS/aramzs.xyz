overview: >-
  Siblings Monroe (Monroe Mann) and Hilary (Crystal Arnette) have discovered
  that they have inherited a lake house and to make things even better, the
  famous horror author Stephen King is rumoured to live somewhere nearby. They
  decide to take their friends down to the lake house to check things out, only
  to find immediate resistance from all of the locals, who insist that King
  doesn't live in the area. Despite being completely unwelcome, they decide to
  stay and soon find that people are being killed one by one in a manner similar
  to several deaths in various Stephen King stories.

I was going to give this two stars for being filmed competently but then there was that godawful flashback to 20 minutes ago and even worse dream sequence so -.5 of a star for those disasters.
