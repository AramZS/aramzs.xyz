overview: >-
  For four years, the courageous crew of the NSEA protector - "Commander Peter
  Quincy Taggart" (Tim Allen), "Lt. Tawny Madison (Sigourney Weaver) and
  "Dr.Lazarus" (Alan Rickman) - set off on a thrilling and often dangerous
  mission in space...and then their series was cancelled! Now, twenty years
  later, aliens under attack have mistaken the Galaxy Quest television
  transmissions for "historical documents" and beam up the crew of has-been
  actors to save the universe. With no script, no director and no clue, the
  actors must turn in the performances of their lives.
