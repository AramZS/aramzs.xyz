overview: >-
  Thad Beaumont is the author of a highly successful series of violent pulp
  thrillers written under the pseudonym of ‘George Stark’, but when he decides
  to ‘kill-off’ his alter-ego in a mock ceremony, it precipitates a string of
  sadistic murders matching those in his pulp novels, which are soon discovered
  to be the work of Stark himself. Looking like a maniacal version of his
  counterpart, Stark is not so willing to quit the writing game – even if it
  means coming after Thad's wife and their baby.
