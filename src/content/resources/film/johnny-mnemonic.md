overview: >-
  In a dystopian 2021, Johnny is a data trafficker who has an implant that
  allows him to securely store data too sensitive for regular computer networks.
  On one delivery run, he accepts a package that not only exceeds the implant's
  safety limits—and will kill him if the data is not removed in time—but also
  contains information far more important and valuable than he had ever
  imagined. On a race against time, he must avoid the assassins sent to kill him
  and remove the data before it, too, ends his life.
