overview: >-
  "This Is Spinal Tap" shines a light on the self-contained universe of a metal
  band struggling to get back on the charts, including everything from its
  complicated history of ups and downs, gold albums, name changes and undersold
  concert dates, along with the full host of requisite groupies, promoters,
  hangers-on and historians, sessions, release events and those special
  behind-the-scenes moments that keep it all real.
