overview: >-
  Class Action Park explores the legend, legacy, and truth behind the 1980s
  water park in Vernon, New Jersey that long ago entered the realm of myth.
  Known for its dangerous, unsupervised rides and lack of regulation, guests of
  Action Park expected to walk away with injuries and were lucky if they made it
  out alive. Shirking the trappings of nostalgia, the film uses investigative
  journalism, original animations,  recordings, and interviews with the people
  who lived it to reveal the true story of Action Park.
