overview: >-
  Yuta Okkotsu is a nervous high school student who is suffering from a serious
  problem—his childhood friend Rika has turned into a curse and won't leave him
  alone. Since Rika is no ordinary curse, his plight is noticed by Satoru Gojo,
  a teacher at Jujutsu High, a school where fledgling exorcists learn how to
  combat curses. Gojo convinces Yuta to enroll, but can he learn enough in time
  to confront the curse that haunts him?
