overview: >-
  On the first day at his new school, Cameron instantly falls for Bianca, the
  gorgeous girl of his dreams. The only problem is that Bianca is forbidden to
  date until her ill-tempered, completely un-dateable older sister Kat goes out,
  too. In an attempt to solve his problem, Cameron singles out the only guy who
  could possibly be a match for Kat: a mysterious bad boy with a nasty
  reputation of his own.
