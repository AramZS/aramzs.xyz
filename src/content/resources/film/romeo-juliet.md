Look, Leo's acting hasn't changed between this movie and the present. So, I think, if they'd just replaced Claire Danes with a bear in this film Leo could have gotten his Oscar for this one and we could have all been saved a lot of drama. And really, just imagine how much crazier the editing would have been!
