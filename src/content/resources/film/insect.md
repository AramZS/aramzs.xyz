overview: >-
  The Dung Beetle is late, the Parasite is asleep and Mrs Larva is more
  interested in her knitting than the director’s instructions. It’s clear: this
  amateur theatre company has a long way to go before they can perform their
  version of The Insect Play, a famous satirical work from 1922 by the brothers
  Karel and Josef Čapek which features insects with decidedly human traits:
  greed, egocentrism, jealousy.
