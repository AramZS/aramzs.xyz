overview: >-
  Thirteen-year-old Jesse is a typical teenager who hates his teacher, Mrs.
  Fink. While visiting a vintage clothing shop, Jesse sees a doll that looks
  exactly like his dreaded teacher, and he convinces the shopkeeper to sell it
  to him. When Jesse accidentally pierces the doll's arm with a sewing needle,
  he is shocked to find Mrs. Fink with her arm in a sling the next day and gets
  spooked when a spot on the doll's face appears, exactly where Mrs. Fink has a
  mole.
