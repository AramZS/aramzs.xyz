overview: >-
  In the questionable town of Deer Meadow, Washington, FBI Agent Desmond
  inexplicably disappears while hunting for the man who murdered a teen girl.
  The killer is never apprehended, and, after experiencing dark visions and
  supernatural encounters, Agent Dale Cooper chillingly predicts that the
  culprit will claim another life. Meanwhile, in the more cozy town of Twin
  Peaks, hedonistic beauty Laura Palmer hangs with lowlifes and seems destined
  for a grisly fate.
