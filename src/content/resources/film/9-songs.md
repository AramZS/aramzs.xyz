overview: >-
  Matt, a young glaciologist, soars across the vast, silent, icebound
  immensities of the South Pole as he recalls his love affair with Lisa. They
  meet at a mobbed rock concert in a vast music hall - London's Brixton Academy.
  They are in bed at night's end. Together, over a period of several months,
  they pursue a mutual sexual passion whose inevitable stages unfold in
  counterpoint to nine live-concert songs.
