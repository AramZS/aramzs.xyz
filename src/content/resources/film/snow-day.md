overview: >-
  When an entire town in upstate New York is closed down by an unexpected
  snowfall, a "snow day" begins when a group of elementary school kids, led by
  Natalie Brandston, try to ensure that the schools stay closed by stopping a
  mechanical snowplow driver by trying to hijack his plow truck. Meanwhile,
  Natalie's big brother Hal is using this day to try to win the affections of
  Claire Bonner, the most popular girl in his high school, while Hal and
  Natalie's father Tom, a TV meteorologist, faces off against a rival
  meteorologist for weather coverage of the day's events.
