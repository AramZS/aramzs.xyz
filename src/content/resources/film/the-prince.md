overview: >-
  As Lord Voldemort tightens his grip on both the Muggle and wizarding worlds,
  Hogwarts is no longer a safe haven. Harry suspects perils may even lie within
  the castle, but Dumbledore is more intent upon preparing him for the final
  battle fast approaching. Together they work to find the key to unlock
  Voldemorts defenses and to this end, Dumbledore recruits his old friend and
  colleague Horace Slughorn, whom he believes holds crucial information. Even as
  the decisive showdown looms, romance blossoms for Harry, Ron, Hermione and
  their classmates. Love is in the air, but danger lies ahead and Hogwarts may
  never be the same again.
