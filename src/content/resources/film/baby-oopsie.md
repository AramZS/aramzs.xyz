overview: >-
  Perpetually picked on and endlessly neglected Sybil Pittman finds little joy
  in her life...except for her massive doll collection that has grown to
  perverse proportions! Every day, Sybil locks herself in her basement,
  broadcasting her doll restoration vlog all by herself, that is until the
  remnants of a mysterious doll - the dreaded "Baby Oopsie" comes into her life!
  After carefully restoring the doll, Sybil comes to realize that the tiny
  terror is exacting revenge on her oppressors, mercilessly murdering them one
  by one. And while Sybil finds herself enjoying Baby Oopsie's bloody brand of
  vengeance, she soon changes her tune when the demonic toy turns its evil
  attentions to Sybil and those she actually cares about.
