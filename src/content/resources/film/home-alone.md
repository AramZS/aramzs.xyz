  Eight-year-old Kevin McCallister makes the most of the situation after his
  family unwittingly leaves him behind when they go on Christmas vacation. But
  when a pair of bungling burglars set their sights on Kevin's house, the plucky
  kid stands ready to defend his territory. By planting booby traps galore,
  adorably mischievous Kevin stands his ground as his frantic mother attempts to
  race home before Christmas Day.
