overview: >-
  As the Clone Wars sweep through the galaxy, the heroic Jedi Knights struggle
  to maintain order and restore peace. More and more systems are falling prey to
  the forces of the dark side as the Galactic Republic slips further and further
  under the sway of the Separatists and their never-ending droid army. Anakin
  Skywalker and his Padawan learner Ahsoka Tano find themselves on a mission
  with far-reaching consequences, one that brings them face-to-face with crime
  lord Jabba the Hutt. But Count Dooku and his sinister agents, including the
  nefarious Asajj Ventress, will stop at nothing to ensure that Anakin and
  Ahsoka fail at their quest. Meanwhile, on the front lines of the Clone Wars,
  Obi-Wan Kenobi and Master Yoda lead the massive clone army in a valiant effort
  to resist the forces of the dark side...
