  Tricia's husband has been missing for seven years. Her younger sister Callie
  comes to live with her as the pressure mounts to finally declare him 'dead in
  absentia'. Tricia is reluctant, always holding out hope, but Callie is
  practical and wants her to move on. As Tricia sifts through the wreckage and
  tries to move on with her life, Callie finds herself drawn to an ominous
  tunnel near the house.
