overview: >-
  Set in 1977, back when sex was safe, pleasure was a business and business was
  booming, idealistic porn producer Jack Horner aspires to elevate his craft to
  an art form. Horner discovers Eddie Adams, a hot young talent working as a
  busboy in a nightclub, and welcomes him into the extended family of
  movie-makers, misfits and hangers-on that are always around. Adams' rise from
  nobody to a celebrity adult entertainer is meteoric, and soon the whole world
  seems to know his porn alter ego, "Dirk Diggler". Now, when disco and drugs
  are in vogue, fashion is in flux and the party never seems to stop, Adams'
  dreams of turning sex into stardom are about to collide with cold, hard
  reality.
