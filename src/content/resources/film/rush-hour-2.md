overview: >-
  It's vacation time for Carter as he finds himself alongside Lee in Hong Kong
  wishing for more excitement. While Carter wants to party and meet the ladies,
  Lee is out to track down a Triad gang lord who may be responsible for killing
  two men at the American Embassy. Things get complicated as the pair stumble
  onto a counterfeiting plot. The boys are soon up to their necks in fist fights
  and life-threatening situations. A trip back to the U.S. may provide the
  answers about the bombing, the counterfeiting, and the true allegiance of sexy
  customs agent Isabella.
