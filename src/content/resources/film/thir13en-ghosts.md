overview: >-
  Arthur and his two children, Kathy and Bobby, inherit his Uncle Cyrus's
  estate: a glass house that serves as a prison to 12 ghosts. When the family,
  accompanied by Bobby's Nanny and an attorney, enter the house they find
  themselves trapped inside an evil machine "designed by the devil and powered
  by the dead" to open the Eye of Hell. Aided by Dennis, a ghost hunter, and his
  rival Kalina, a ghost rights activist out to set the ghosts free, the group
  must do what they can to get out of the house alive.
