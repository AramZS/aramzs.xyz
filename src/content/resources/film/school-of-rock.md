overview: >-
  Fired from his band and hard up for cash, guitarist and vocalist Dewey Finn
  finagles his way into a job as a fifth-grade substitute teacher at a private
  school, where he secretly begins teaching his students the finer points of
  rock 'n' roll. The school's hard-nosed principal is rightly suspicious of
  Finn's activities. But Finn's roommate remains in the dark about what he's
  doing.
