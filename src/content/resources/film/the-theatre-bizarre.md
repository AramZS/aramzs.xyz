overview: >-
  Down a seedy city street in her neighborhood, young Enola Penny is obsessed
  with what appears to be a long abandoned theatre. One night, she sees that the
  front door is slightly ajar and impulsively decides to sneak inside. But there
  in the dark, decrepit auditorium, a show unlike any other unfolds before her
  eyes. Its host is an eerie human puppet named Peg Poett who will introduce
  Penny to six tales of the bizarre: A couple traveling in a remote part of the
  French Pyrenees cross paths with a lustful witch; A paranoid lover faces the
  wrath of a partner who has been pushed to her limit; The Freudian dreams of an
  unfaithful husband blur the lines between fantasy and reality; The horrors of
  the real world are interpreted through the mind of a child; A woman addicted
  to other people's memories gets her fix through the vitreous fluid of her
  victims' eyeballs; And a perverse obsession with sweets turns sour for a
  couple in too deep.
