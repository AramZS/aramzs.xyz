overview: >-
  A man and woman meet by chance at a romantic inn over dinner and, although
  both are married to others, they find themselves in the same bed the next
  morning questioning how this could have happened. They agree to meet on the
  same weekend each year—in the same hotel room—and the years pass each has some
  personal crisis that the other helps them through, often without both of them
  understanding what is going on.
