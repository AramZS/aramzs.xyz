Having now re-watched this after re-watching the entire series it is an especially baffling entry. One of the things that made the W. S. Anderson RE films stand out in the series was their clear, easy-to-understand, action and the bright, relatively high contrast, look, that made them pretty fun. This one is an Anderson film, but it is plagued by extremely low-contrast, difficult to see, shots; a lot of very dark scenes; and just incredibly, almost sickeningly, choppy editing only compounded by some overly shaky hand-held work. I really don't know what happened with this film to make it so gross to watch, but it is a shame that a series that seemed to have fun with its concepts ended up going out on such a grim, unoriginal, and unpleasant entry.
