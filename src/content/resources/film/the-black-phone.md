overview: >-
  Finney Blake, a shy but clever 13-year-old boy, is abducted by a sadistic
  killer and trapped in a soundproof basement where screaming is of little use.
  When a disconnected phone on the wall begins to ring, Finney discovers that he
  can hear the voices of the killer’s previous victims. And they are dead set on
  making sure that what happened to them doesn’t happen to Finney.
