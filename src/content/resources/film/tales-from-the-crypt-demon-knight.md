overview: >-
  Ex-soldier Frank Brayker is the guardian of an ancient key that can unlock
  tremendous evil; the sinister Collector is a demon who wants the key so he can
  initiate the apocalypse. On the run from wicked mercenaries for almost 90
  years, Brayker finally stops in at a boarding house in New Mexico where — with
  the help of its residents — he plans to face off against the Collector and his
  band of ghouls, preventing them from ever seizing the key.
