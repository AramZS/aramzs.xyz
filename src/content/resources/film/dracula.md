overview: >-
  At midnight on Walpurgis Night, an English clerk, Renfield, arrives at Count
  Dracula's castle in the Carpathian Mountains. After signing papers to take
  over a ruined abbey near London, Dracula drives Renfield mad and commands
  obedience. Renfield escorts the boxed count on a death ship to London. From
  there, the Count is introduced into the society of his neighbor, Dr. Seward,
  who runs an asylum. Dracula makes short work of family friend Lucia Weston,
  then begins his assault on Eva Seward, the doctor's daughter. A visiting
  expert in the occult, Van Helsing, recognizes Dracula for who he is, and there
  begins a battle for Eva's body and soul.
