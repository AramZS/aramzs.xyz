I've been watching [PointyHat's channel](https://www.youtube.com/@pointyhatstudios) lately as I've been prepping for a new D&D game I'm running. His suggestions have all been very useful and his videos are informative and interesting. Really useful to have this list of all the cool stuff he's given away for free!
