As a photographer I really like Brandur's homepage, the idea of having a ration of your own work on display alongside most recent writing is appealing to me. I haven't gotten my camera out often enough this year, I should really put together a gallery of my prior work and then update my homepage akin to Brandur's.

Brandur has split their content by type as: [long form articles](https://brandur.org/articles), [off-topic, short form atoms](https://brandur.org/atoms) and a [stream of conscious called fragments](https://brandur.org/fragments); these are very similar to my own Essays, Noteworthy and Thoughts, this gives their website a digital garden vibe.
