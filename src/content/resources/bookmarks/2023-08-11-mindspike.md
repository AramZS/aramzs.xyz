Found via [[ 【 S I N E W A V E 】 ]]'s button board; I have accidentally ended up spending an hour playing this HTML5 based game when I had only intended on checking out the link due to its interesting 88x31 button banner.

The game itself is a point and click adventure with intriguing story and both immersive visuals and soundscape, I want to do a more detailed review in the [[near future]].
