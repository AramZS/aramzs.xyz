Found out about this [via](https://hamatti.org/posts/blaugust-starts-august-1st/).

Blaugust is described as, quote selected by the above [from](https://aggronaut.com/2024/07/12/blaugust-2024-is-coming/): 

> Blaugust is a month-long event that takes place each August which focuses on blogging primarily and has started to include other forms of serialized content over the last several years. The goal is to stoke the fires of creativity and allow bloggers and other content creators to mingle in a shared community while pushing each other to post more regularly. Above all the goal of Blaugust has always been to prove to folks that they can in fact sit down every day and create something fresh and then share it with the world. Posting regularly builds a community and in this era of AI-slop content, our voices are needed even more than we ever have been at any point in the past. Our hope is to create a nurturing environment where Veteran bloggers can help those just getting started and the cross-pollination of ideas can create something truly spectacular.

31 posts in one month seems like a cool idea to me!
