I added this game to my Steam Wishlist after watching [FallenShogun Gaming's quick play through on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHPw5IXMjgc). It feels very reminiscent of Settlers II, a game I spent many an hour playing when I was a teen; Super Fantasy Kingdom is a roguelite city builder set in a Survival fantasy world.

I look forward to putting some hours into this game once it has released.
