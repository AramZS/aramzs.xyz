I was introduced to Jake's website via their post [Were React Hooks a Mistake?](https://jakelazaroff.com/words/were-react-hooks-a-mistake/); there was a fair bit of discussion among the React developers I know whether React had taken a wrong turn. I'm primarily a Vue developer and so Jake's post helped shine some light on the discussion.

Their [[ JAKE.MUSEUM ]] project caught my attention as an interesting way of showcasing someone's personal history with hypertext media - a subject that I am very interested in myself.
