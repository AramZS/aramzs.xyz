Created a digital character sheet for the Homeworld Revelations 2d20 game! It lets you import and export JSON and save to local storage. Plus you can share a link that will auto fill character information for your players. Let me know if you see any issues!

I had a lot of fun with running game, so hopefully it will be useful to you too.
