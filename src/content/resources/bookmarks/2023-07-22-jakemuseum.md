I stumbled upon Jake Museum while browsing around [[Jake Lazaroff's Website]] and inevitably coming across their GitHub. I have a personal interest in #OldWeb and personal histories with the hypertext medium of the world wide web.

The internet is transitory, we have the Internet Archive to thank for providing a portal to the past via their [Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web/) however personal museum projects like this one will always be a better lens into the past because its through the eyes of the subject themselves.

I have in the past resurrected some of my original websites but never in such a thoughtful way as Jake Museum - I should follow their footsteps, we all should.
