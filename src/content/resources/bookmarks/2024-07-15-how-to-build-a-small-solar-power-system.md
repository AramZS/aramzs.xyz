I've always been a huge admirer of LowTech Magazine and one of the things I want to do, badly, is set up a home server powered entirely with Solar similar to the way they've got their stuff running. 

I'm obviously a lot more limited in space and sunlight, but during HOPE2024 someone pointed out to me that this article actually has some tips that could work well in a small NYC apartment.
