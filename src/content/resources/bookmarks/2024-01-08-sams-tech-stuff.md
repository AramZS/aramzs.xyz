Found via [[Nokia64's cyberSpace]] and stayed for their [Vintage Computer collection](https://samuele963.github.io/vintagecomp/) especially because they have a page for their [Toshiba T1200XE laptop](https://samuele963.github.io/vintagecomp/toshiba_t1200xe_001.html). Unfortunately it appears their T1200 isn't functional, this reminds me that I should finish and publish my own [[Toshiba T1200]] page.
