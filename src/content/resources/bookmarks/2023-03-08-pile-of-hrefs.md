> A hastily thrown together project by [Dana Byerly](https://danabyerly.com/), prompted by a moment of thinking "Maybe I would use Pinboard more if it was responsive?". I guess we'll find out! Contents curated soley for my reading list and/or reference for future hastily thrown together projects.

This is _the_ project that prompted me to add a bookmarks resource collection to PhotoGabble.
