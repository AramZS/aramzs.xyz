This is really great, a very straightforward way to describe how to approach debugging similar to how I think about it. 

I think the first three items are actually the hardest for most people to remember. The temptation to squash instead of consider is very real. It is easy to feel permanently stuck and not realize you can, with work, get over anything. 

The third point "trust nobody and nothing" is pretty important and something that early developers often screw up. It is easy to assume that known code bases, earlier developers, and other people did it the right way, even when it is very possible that they didn't.
