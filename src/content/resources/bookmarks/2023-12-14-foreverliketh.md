I have been serendipitously visiting Foreverliketh every month this year, it's a surprise I had not added it to my blogroll sooner! I'm unsure _who_ is behind the website and maybe that's how they like it but their approach to the internet and digital gardening is similar to mine. Their [Connectivism](https://foreverliketh.is/docs/connectivism/home-page/) page has sent me down multiple [[rabbit holes]] this year alone and will likely do so for the foreseeable future.
