 I really enjoy Shrik's website, not only is its #OldWeb aesthetic beautiful to my eyes, it also appears that we share similar interests.

One section of the website that really stood out to me is their [Quick Bits](https://shrik3.com/bits/), these are similar to my own [Week In Review](/topic/week-in-review/). I do like how they have a WIP for the current week, I should implement that here.
