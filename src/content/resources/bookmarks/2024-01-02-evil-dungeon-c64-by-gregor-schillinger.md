In this C64 fantasy dungeon crawler you play as Alrik, a young adventurer who has to master his first quest. Fight against monsters, search for treasure and plan your next steps to escape the **Evil Dungeon** labyrinth.

I found the game via this [library of C64 games you can play in your browser](https://c64.krissz.hu/online-playable-games/), thanks to that website you too can [play Evil Dungeon online](https://c64.krissz.hu/evil-dungeon/play-online/).

There is even a sequel: [[ EVIL DUNGEON II  (C64) by Gregor Schillinger | Evil Dungeon II ]].

I played this game for about 25 minutes before accidentally refreshing the browser and loosing my progress; I intend to play through to completion to review it fully in the coming days.
