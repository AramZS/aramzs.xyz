It was Simon's [Weeknotes](https://simonwillison.net/tags/weeknotes/) that originally sparked my [week in review](/topic/week-in-review/) series. The idea of keeping a list of things that had interested you that week and sharing it alongside a short review felt just low effort enough for me to be able to commit to doing it perpetually.

Aside from Simon's Week Notes, their [Today I learned](https://til.simonwillison.net/) collection is a superb idea that I would like to ~~steal~~ **use** on PhotoGabble.
