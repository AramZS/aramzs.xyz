I found James's website through [[Robb Knight's Website|Robb Knights]] post [Eleventy Post Graph Plugin](https://rknight.me/eleventy-post-graph-plugin/) because James made use of Robbs graph plugin ([[ @rknightuk/eleventy-plugin-post-graph ]]) on his [Thoughts page](https://jamesdoc.com/blog/).

Two of James recent thoughts immediately took my attention: [Adding a git based changelog in 11ty](https://jamesdoc.com/blog/2023/git-changelog-in-11ty/) and [Experimenting with analytics via Tinylytics](https://jamesdoc.com/blog/2023/analytic-experiment/).

I recently had assistance from Belmin in [[Addition of Git Log|adding a git log to PhotoGabble]], so reading James's experience was interesting. Tinylytics also looks interesting, I use [GoatCounter](https://www.goatcounter.com/) for PhotoGabble, but it is always nice to see what is newly available.
