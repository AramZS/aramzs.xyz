I found this via the [Jupiter Engine page](https://kool.tools/blog/jupiter-engine) of [[candle's website]], they have even made the engine behind their game available for use in the download zip.

The game itself is a browser based interactive sci-fi horror story, I haven't played it for more than five minutes and have bookmarked to remind me to come back and give it a full play through!
