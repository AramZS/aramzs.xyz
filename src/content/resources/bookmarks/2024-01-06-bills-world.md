This is an interesting website that brings back a lot of memories because I first used the internet with a CRT monitor like the one shown here using Netscape Navigator.

I borrowed Bill's BSOD gif (found via clicking the start menu and then any of the menu items), and placed it on my own [BSOD page](/bsod) as a bit of an Easter egg.

I have lost about two hours to this website and its many links!
