Cinni's website is a beautiful example of what I love about the internet. It's wonderfully designed and gives me a huge dose of nostalgia.

They seem to have a similar history on the internet to myself, playing host to [[cinni's oekaki|their own oekaki board]] and referencing [[The Quilting Bee]] on their [about page](https://cinni.net/?z=/about).

Cinni's other projects include [[ichigo directory]], [[ the cutie internet archive ]] and [[ 99GIF shop ]], all of which I absolutely love!
