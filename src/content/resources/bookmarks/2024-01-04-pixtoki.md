I found this beautifully designed personal website while doing some [[Digital Spelunking]] they were a member of the Eden Enchanted forum which went down some time in April 2005. I have linked to the wayback machine copy of the website from that time.

Daria has some wonderful pixel art displayed on this website, I wonder what they are doing now.
