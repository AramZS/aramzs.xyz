A website built with #11ty. It was through one of Juha's posts on the Fediverse that I discovered [[ @rknightuk/eleventy-plugin-post-graph ]], which I then quickly incorporated into PhotoGabble.

I like their [weeklies posts](https://hamatti.org/weeklies/), they are similar to my Week In Review and there is some superb stuff to look through there.
