Great video and summary of Alex's ideas here. 

> is it possible to build software infrastructure with longevity and maintenance characteristics that rival those of physical infrastructure? A lot of people think this is basically impossibleâ€”our computational capabilities are increasing too rapidly, and our software is changing too frequently, that the only way to keep up is a constant and significant expenditure of resources. I disagree.
