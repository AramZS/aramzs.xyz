It's always nice to visit a website that has a lot similar with your own; vm has written a lot of interesting posts, my favourite so far being [Tweaking Color Schemes for Accessibility with Genetic Algorithms](https://vm70.neocities.org/posts/2023-11-20-colorscheme-ga/). Well worth checking out.

I was intrequed by the [Geek Code Block](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geek_Code) on their [about page](https://vm70.neocities.org/about) might be something I'd like to add to mine.
