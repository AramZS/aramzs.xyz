Went to an excellent presentation about the Demoscene at HOPE2024 this year that gave me a bunch of links to really interesting stuff. This one in particular is fascinating, basically a bot that responds to Mastodon with Demoscene-like creations rendered in real time on an emulation of old hardware. Very cool!
