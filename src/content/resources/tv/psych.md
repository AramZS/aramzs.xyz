overview: >-
  Thanks to his police officer father's efforts, Shawn Spencer spent his
  childhood developing a keen eye for detail (and a lasting dislike of his dad).
  Years later, Shawn's frequent tips to the police lead to him being falsely
  accused of a crime he solved.


  Now, Shawn has no choice but to use his abilities to perpetuate his cover
  story: psychic crime-solving powers, all the while dragging his best friend,
  his dad, and the police along for the ride.
