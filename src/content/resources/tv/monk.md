  Adrian Monk was once a rising star with the San Francisco Police Department,

  baffling cases. But after the tragic (and still unsolved) murder of his wife
  Trudy, he developed an extreme case of obsessive-compulsive disorder. Now
  working as a private consultant, Monk continues to investigate cases in the
  most unconventional ways.
