overview: >-
  The year is 2021. Deep below the ocean's surface, looms a vast, magnificently
  high-tech compound: Sealab. A multi-national scientific station with an annual
  budget in the trillions, manned by a motley collection of malcontents and
  screw-ups who were unfit for work in the private sector. They really don't get
  any research done, but instead spend their time bickering among themselves or
  just plain goofing off. The crew have manipulated their luckless leader,
  Captain Murphy, into submission, and are content to ride the government clock,
  raking in fat, hazardous-duty paychecks.
