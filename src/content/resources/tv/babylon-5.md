overview: >-
  Babylon 5 is a five-mile long space station located in neutral space. Built by
  the Earth Alliance in the 2250s, its goal is to maintain peace among the
  various alien races by providing a sanctuary where grievances and negotiations
  can be worked out among duly appointed ambassadors. A council made up of
  representatives from the five major space-faring civilizations - the Earth
  Alliance, Minbari Federation, Centauri Republic, Narn Regime, and Vorlon
  Empire - work with the League of Non-Aligned Worlds to keep interstellar
  relations under control. Aside from its diplomatic function, Babylon 5 also
  serves as a military post for Earth and a port of call for travelers, traders,
  businessmen, criminals, and Rangers.
