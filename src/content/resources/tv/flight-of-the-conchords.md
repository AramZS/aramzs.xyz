overview: >-
  The trials and tribulations of a two man, digi-folk band who have moved from
  New Zealand to New York in the hope of forging a successful music career. So
  far they've managed to find a manager (whose "other" job is at the New Zealand
  Consulate), one fan (a married obsessive) and one friend (who owns the local
  pawn shop) -- but not much else.
