overview: >-
  Set between the events of Star Wars: Episodes III and IV, the story unfolds
  during a dark time when the evil Galactic Empire is tightening its grip of
  power on the galaxy. Imperial forces have occupied a remote planet and are
  ruining the lives of its people. The motley but clever crew of the starship
  Ghost — cowboy Jedi Kanan, ace pilot Hera, street-smart teenager Ezra, the
  “muscle” Zeb, warrior firebrand Sabine, and cantankerous old astromech droid
  Chopper — is among a select few who are brave enough to stand against the
  Empire. Together, they will face threatening new villains, encounter colorful
  adversaries, embark on thrilling adventures, and become heroes with the power
  to ignite a rebellion.
