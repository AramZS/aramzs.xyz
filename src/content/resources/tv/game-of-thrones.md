  Seven noble families fight for control of the mythical land of Westeros.
  Friction between the houses leads to full-scale war. All while a very ancient
  evil awakens in the farthest north. Amidst the war, a neglected military order
  of misfits, the Night's Watch, is all that stands between the realms of men
  and icy horrors beyond.
