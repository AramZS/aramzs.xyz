overview: >-
  In an attempt to beautify her town — and advance her career — Leslie Knope, a
  mid-level bureaucrat in the Parks and Recreation Department of Pawnee,
  Indiana, takes on bureaucrats, cranky neighbors, and single-issue fanatics
  whose weapons are lawsuits, the jumble of city codes, and the democratic
  process she loves so much.
