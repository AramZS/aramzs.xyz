overview: >-
  When they were boys, Sam and Dean Winchester lost their mother to a mysterious
  and demonic supernatural force. Subsequently, their father raised them to be
  soldiers. He taught them about the paranormal evil that lives in the dark
  corners and on the back roads of America ... and he taught them how to kill
  it. Now, the Winchester brothers crisscross the country in their '67 Chevy
  Impala, battling every kind of supernatural threat they encounter along the
  way.
