overview: >-
  Max Headroom is a British-produced American satirical science fiction
  television series by Chrysalis Visual Programming and Lakeside Productions for
  Lorimar-Telepictures that aired in the United States on ABC from March 1987 to
  May 1988. The series was based on the Channel 4 British TV pilot produced by
  Chrysalis, Max Headroom: 20 Minutes into the Future. The series is often
  mistaken as an American-produced show due to the setting and its use of an
  almost entirely US cast along with being broadcast in the USA on the ABC
  network. Cinemax aired the UK pilot followed by a six-week run of highlights
  from The Max Headroom Show, a music video show where Headroom appears between
  music videos. ABC took an interest in the pilot and asked Chrysalis/Lakeside
  to produce the series for US audiences.


  The show went into production in late 1986 and ran for six episodes in the
  first season with eight being produced in season two.
