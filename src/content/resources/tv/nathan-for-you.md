overview: >-
  Self-proclaimed business expert, writer, director and comedian Nathan Fielder
  helps real small businesses turn a profit with marketing tactics that no
  ordinary consultant would dare to attempt. From driving foot traffic to an
  off-the-strip souvenir shop by using Hollywood flair and a Johnny Depp
  impersonator, to creating a rebate that can only be redeemed by climbing a
  mountain, to founding a coffee shop called "Dumb Starbucks,” Nathan has always
  gone to the limit to make his ideas come to life. With his unorthodox approach
  to problem solving, Nathan’s genuine efforts to do good often draw the real
  people he encounters into an experience far beyond what they signed up for.
