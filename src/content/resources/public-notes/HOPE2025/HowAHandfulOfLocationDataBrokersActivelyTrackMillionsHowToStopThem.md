[How a Handful of Location Data Brokers Actively Track Millions, and How to Stop Them](https://schedule.hope.net/hope16/talk/LYSZ3L/)

- Gravy Analytics data broker focused on locations 
- Most devs didn't know about Gravy or Ventel. 
- X-Mode Social (Outlogic LLC) - Collects 10 billion data points a day 
- Even though X-Mode was banned it is persistent in many apps. 
- The biggest source of data leakage is RTB 
- Example bid request for ADCOMv1 
- Mobilewalla is a concrete example of a data broker who has participated in ad bids data harvesting. 
- GPS, wifi access points, bluetooth beacons (nyt article) 
- [Google Fused API](https://developers.google.com/location-context/fused-location-provider)
	- Efficacy still needs investigation 
- Wifi bridging 
- Evercookie - combinations of all persistence mechanisms in the browser. 
- Privacy invasive SDKs are there in most apps. 
- Broker data is sold to the gov't (nice graphic here to use)
- [FTC Says Data Brokers Unlawfully Tracked Protesters and US Military Personnel | WIRED](https://www.wired.com/story/ftc-mobilewalla-gravy-analytics-orders/) 
- What can developers do 
	- Choose which SDKs you use in your apps. 
	- Reduce permissions 
	- Publish your privacy policies 
	- have users backs, tell them about downstream breaches 
- Legislators? 
	- Literally do anything! 
	- CCPA and BIPA are good acts 
	- Federal data privacy law already please! 
		- One without pre-emption so it is a floor not a ceiling for states 
		- Yes: Private rights of Action - allow those effected to sue those who abuse privacy. This is the only way to give the legislation teeth. 
	- At least enforce what already exists 
	- FTC  regulators need more leeway. 
- Users
	- Randomize your mobile advertising id 
- Use seperate devices for separate purposes.
