# The Trials and Tribulations of Building Your Own Phone

- [Wesley Appler](https://schedule.hope.net/hope16/speaker/BZNSPC/)
	- Wesley Appler (aka lamemakes) is a professional software engineer and a recreational hardware engineer who is incredibly passionate about open source, human rights, and digital privacy.

	- instagram: @lamemakes
- Wanted to learn more about Rust, GSM networks, and design RF hardware and PCBs 
- Where do you even start? 
- Need to figure out modems 
	- SIM7600 
	- Sales reps don't respond if you are solo, so pretend to be an IOT startup. 
	- Examined the Dragonfly Nano as an option 
		- Think it might just be a money grab 
		- Didn't need carrier certification 
- Needed to build a development board 
	- Michael Ozmen (sp?) has guides 
	- V1 had - Antennas broken out to external U.FL receptacles 
	- USB-C 2 for interfacing 
	- Nano SIM card slot 
	- Voltage shifters, labeled pins, indicator LEDs. 
	- O2/O1 soldering takes a long time and is high difficulty 
- Needed an abstraction layer for the software 
- Modem handler service in Rust 
- Used tokio to handle Unsolicited Result Codes async 
- API needed to handle sending and receiving SMS and other basic phone functionality 
- ModemManager - a DBus-activated daemon which controls mobile broadband devices and connections. 
- Whisperfish's Presage - a default phone for comms 
- Encrypting SMS in transit?
	- The content only? 
	- Metadata is still exposed 
- Encrypt data at rest by default 
- IMEI - 
	- carrier certified modems cannot switch this 
	- A 15 digest *International Mobile Equipment Identity*
	- Unique device ID 
	- carrys info on device make and model 
	- tracks device activity 
	- spoofable 
	- Some eSIM chips allow for 7+ different operator profiles 
	- SIM7600 allows for setting of IMEI. 
	- Changing the IMEI based on the operator profile makes it harder to surveil 
	- Swapping allows for more network compatibility and to pretend to be different types of devices. 
- Building your own device can include Decentralized comms as well 
- Mesh networking
	- A qual client for Bluetooth, wifi, meshing. 
	- Meshtastic or other LoRa add-ons 
- Local networking like a PirateBox 
- Detecting stingrays using rayhunter 
	- Analyizing traffic from modem and base station 
	- Notifying users

- [PinePhone - PINE64](https://pine64.org/devices/pinephone/)
- No 3G carriers anymore in the US. 
- SilentSMS?
	- [Using silent SMS to localize LTE users](https://mandomat.github.io/2023-09-21-localization-with-silent-SMS/)
	- [GitHub - domi007/silentSMS: This is a free Android app that can be used to send silent text messages.](https://github.com/domi007/silentSMS)
	- Could be detectable with more controls and software on the modem since it is under your full control. 
- RayHunter - could become an open source hardware platform for that. 
- Battery Life? 
	- Haven't gotten there yet.
