## Notes 

- Investigating magazines
- Cooper Hewit Library has some really interesting archives. 
- Kevin Kelly's hypothasis of 1000 true fans 
- Long tail media shifts 
	- example - Drift - luxury indie mags exist in new ways now. 
- Indie zines and vibe coding 
- [Home-Cooked Software and Barefoot Developers](https://maggieappleton.com/home-cooked-software)
- Admitting something is vibe coded is asking for it to be hacked. 
- Cognitive Security needed 
- A real personal CRM - why not? 
- We need networks that are small fast and strong 
- what kind of software supports this kind of community resilience 
- Communities and resilience - how does home cooked media emerge as things get worse? As we can decreasingly rely on the mainstream platform. 
	- Cultural impact on media structure and usage 
	- Cellphones and therefore apps leapfrogged laptops in many place 
	- Cultural style can matter a lot
		- Marketing a good example of this - how it differs between different countries. 
	- Direct communication cultures better at meeting the SEO expectations from Google (source?)
		- If this is true, does something very different happen here? 
- Journalism and how it will be impacted? 
	- influencers instead of employees 
	- a new style of publisher that does representation instead of publishing (Dicker theory)
	- Communities as fact checkers 
	- Collaborrative articles as an alternative? 
- Over for journalism companies not journalists
