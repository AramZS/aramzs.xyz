- Got access to a digital workspace used by the hackers in an operation, including metadata, etc... 
- Anonymous is loose, anyone can claim (that's bad) 
- Aubrey "Kirtaner" Cottle recently arrested for hacking the Texas GOP 
- Often claimed he is a founder of anonymous (as early as 2018 according to some) - canadian law enforcements / intelligence (CSIS) came to recruit him 
- FBI redacted the CEO of Epik even though they provide hosting to hate groups 
- Kirtaner threatening his ex 
- State hackers using the Anonymous name, brand and images 
- Mystery anonymous members from Tunisa handed over the keys during Arab Spring 
- When they were generating support for protests in Egypt there was an event on Facebook for which Egyptian-claiming Anonymous mass generated profiles that signed up for the protest. 
	- How much influence that had? Debatable. 
	- A Facebook employee disabled spam filters for creating all these spam accounts. 
	- Facebook used its ifra to interfere with a foreign gov't, first time this happened it seems. 
- Kaspersky hack seems fairly credible. 
- Russia's National Republican Army allegedly a resistence group made of Russians, existence is doubted. Linked with John Jackson. 
- Ukraine gave Jason Jay Smart and John Jackson medals for their work. 
- State actors coopting hacktavists and putting them in positions where they are compromised is the major problem. 
- Hacks were done to identify the exact location of people for assassination - the hackers refused or just were uninterested. 
- The other one was an industrial system in russia that was compromised through hacking and there was an explosition that killed a lot of non-soldiers. Kinetic operations. 
- Crossing a line in a way we've seen before. Kinetic and cyber operations should not be paired. 
- "We are supposed to be better than the people we oppose" we shouldn't mimic the things we criticize about them. 
- Can blow up for all of us.
