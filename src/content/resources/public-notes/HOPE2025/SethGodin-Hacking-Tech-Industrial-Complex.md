# Hacking the Tech-Industrial Complex: Learning to See Invisible Systems

- What does it mean to hack for the community?
- The system just does what the system does and if you understand it you can force it into paying attention. 
- Systems hide behind culture, they feel normal, the more we use them the more we use them, once entrenched they work to defend themselves, the user is often not the customer. 
	- Biz systems serve execs
	- Schools optimize for admin 
	- Weddings profit caterers
	- Healthcare perpetuates the systemMedia and tech maximize attentionpolitics serves funders 
	- When hacking a system you need to ask: What is the first principle tha tthis system exists for and do I need to change it or can I use it to make it better. 
- Grateful dead played by different rules but what they delivered is what the system desires and rewards them from. 
- Systems seduce
	- status
	- affiliation 
	- convenience - Tim Wu essay 
	- HOPE audiance doesn't want what comes with conveience you do intentionally inconveineitent things 
	- Efficiency 
	- Freedom from fear is what systems deliver in order to pacify you, people will do almost anything for that. 
- You start with the use case - you see the system and hack it, this is a profound tool 
- What the system offers is deniability - I was just doing my job 
	- it offers helplessness 
	- it creates obedience and fear and convenience 
	- It offers deskilling 
		- If you could make a part better that would be better but systems are more than the sum of their parts. 
- Change agents - things that caue every system in our lives to be vulnerable 
	- technology 
	- media 
	- generations 
- DOminent systems 
	- capitalism
	- [[Colonialism]] 
	- Tech 
	- If you keep an eye on it you can anticipate what it is doing 
- If you do it by yourself it isn't useful 
- If you organize and look at what people who do it for money has done and do it as community action then systems shifts. 
- The system wants you to give up, back up, and not talk about it. 
- Care a lot show up and organize. 
- What we do when we make change happen is we create tension - I might fall behind, I might not be able to work, I might not be able to understand what happens next. What would scare the user enough that they would get rid of their fear by trying it. You make tension happen, you make it so that people are glad afterwords. 
- Leaders are not managers they deal with the problem of lonliness they say I'm going to go over there who wants to come. 
	- This is the place to start
