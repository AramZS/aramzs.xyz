# How Law Enforcement Agencies Compromise Entire Encrypted Chat Platforms

Presented by Joseph Cox, based on his book Dark Wire

- LEOs deliver preloaded phones. They have GPS removed, camera removed, microphone removed. 
- Started with PGP email 
- Then went to Jabber OTR 
- Then to Signal Protocol 
- These phones get sent to drug traffickers 
- These devices are expensive, hundreds or thousands of dollars / euros for a 6mo subscription 
- They are paying for access to encrochat - a social network of criminals. 
- Can buy from certian spy shops in south american, amsterdam, etc 
- Sometimes need to know an agent or resller 
- Sellers can be current or former criminals. 
- White globe videos on youtube in the industry - look at a phone on a network like encrochat and make up a complete bs story about vulns and try and get criminals to switch networks. 
- Phone sale competition can turn violent. 
- dba beStealth was one of the encrypted Blackberries - Canadian leos compromised the encryption key. 
- Ennetcom has encrypted comms but Dutch cops say they've decrypted PGP Messages on Seized server. 
	- Keys were not being managed on the device, they were being managed on the server. 
- Flashing an encrypted phone was a badge of trust - only a real drug trafficker would have an encrypted phone. 
- They look into Phantom Secure the phone supplier and decide to infiltrate and gain leadership's trust and make for a backdoor. 
- Criminals love security theater. 
- They were adding a ghost contact to all group chats and dms that ran through the Anom Jabber service 
- Anom phones had a secret GPS as well. 
- The FBI could use the data to generate a social graph 
- They were then able to push a hack into EncroChat 
- Encro was 90%. criminal users and the 10% included thousands of people and lawyers. 
- Shutting down Encro sending people to Anon which the FBI also owns 
- Sky Chat is an encrypted messaging chat platform used mostly by criminals. 
- Sky phone gets killed when LEOs compromise it. THe US authorities get access to the messages. 
- CLosing down one after the other and Anon takes over because everyone gets pushed to it. 
- FBI keeps being forced to interceed when people are organizing murders. 
- Telegram CEO gets arrested to force them to send data on thousands of users. 
- 404media.co 
- Graphine OS is an impressive branch of the OS but it is mostly used by criminals and that might bias LEO to imagine your as a criminal. 
- Com - a scene of hackers, swappers, etc... not really used for these types of criminals
