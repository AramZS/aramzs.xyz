- Theming around guardening. 
- Advice is constantly changing so you need some way to evaluate it. 
- Security Planner tries to encode a lot of this advice customized to the individual. 
- Think about your attack surface 
- Instead of threat models think about plant hardiness zones - where are you vulnerable, where the threats are, instead think about your environment, your ecosystem, what works what doesn't. 
- You have to give people advice that works for them. 
- No one size fits all for everyone. 
- Layered defense 
	- don't put all your resources on the front line but instead create multipe lines 
	- sort of similar to defense in depth 
	- I want to talk about soil layers 
	- Different layers may work better for different people. 
	- Sometimes start other places before technology, like shared accounts, mutural contacts. 
- Sun, water and nutrients 
	- Privacy and security by design 
	- transparent moderation 
	- people preparing for threats 
	- you can have too much but there are baselines you need 
- Threat Landscape changes with your environment / ecosystem 
- Prepare for specific situations or events like when you know there is a freeze coming and you need to prepare your plants. 
- walled gardens vs open gardens 
	- transparency issues 
	- limitations to data access 
	- Open guardens can be overgrown or abandoned, or fragmentation and complexity can let lots of stuff blume 
- Be careful about whose expert advice you repeat and why 
- Oft repeated advice 
	- Get a password manager 
		- Passkeys but rollout was a mess 
		- Should your grandparents write the passwords down?
	- Multifactor authentication is important 
		- different gradations of risk 
		- use a security key - harder to do. 
	- Need a framework to evaluate advice that is older too.

- Tool based security advice 
	- Tools can become less effective 
	- how you use them matters 
	- update all the things 
- Viral advice 
	- Disable Ad ID - fine but only for specific threats 
	- Use a VPN used to make more sense before HTTPS 
		- So much it can't protect against 
	- Consider your situation for leaving your phone at home during protests. 
		- Def turn off biometrics 
		- don't post stuff on social media that reveals your location 
- AI Training avoidance settings 
- Old or New fangled advice? Advice should change as threats change, but some are reliable.

- Memory safety is important. 
- Don't charge for safety 
- CR has done a number of evaluations.
