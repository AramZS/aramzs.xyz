# Hacking Is a Mindset, Not a Skillset: A Non-Technical Guide to Building Solidarity Infrastructures With Friends

- moshfet 
- Description: You don't need to have tech skills to build a mesh network! In this talk, moshfet will share how he helped spawn an anti-capitalist mesh network in Tucson, Arizona with just a bit of  COVID stimulus money and a wish upon a (shining) star. His goal is to inspire the possibility of building infrastructure in common in local communities - like mesh networks - to push  back against the corporatization and monopolization of critical infrastructures more broadly.
- In the presenter's words: "We didn't choose to work on providing Internet access because we're tech experts (we're not!), but as a demonstration to ourselves and our community: if  complicated technologies such as the Internet can be given away at cost by a network of volunteers, what's to stop people in Tucson from doing the same thing with cellular service?Libraries of Things? Repair cafes?"

- Moder tech systems tend to be 
	- Opaque - the inner workings are inaccessible to users and many developers 
	- Inflexible - rigid to a diversity of wants and needs 
	- Hegemonic - funnel users towards a carefully crafted UX
	- Exploitative
	- Disempowering 
- So how do we use these systems in ways they aren't designed for
