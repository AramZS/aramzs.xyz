- Runs through websocket encapsulation as a strategy 
- The different strategies can be combined together
- SOCK5 is not free but broadly supported. 
- Outline server is at ss:// 
- SOCK5 connections at socks5://
- DNS blocking needs to be detected and then bypassed. 
- DNS over Edge `doh:` is a strategy 
- `tlsfrag:` is another strategy 
- `curl httpsL//ipinfo.to` is a way to quickly get your IP info and known data. 
- Outline Manager let's you set up your own VPN out nodes

- github.com/Jigsaw-Code/outline-sdk/x/examples/fetch 
	- This shows how the get process works. 
	- You can run against checker.soax.com/api/ipinfo checker to see socks5 status 
	- The go command allows you to configure the combination of different strategies.
