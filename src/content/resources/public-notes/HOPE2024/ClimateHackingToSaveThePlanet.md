# Climate Hacking to Save the Planet

- Big advantages can come out of changes in energy production and use 
- eia.gov/totalenergy/data/flow-graphs/total-energy.php 
	- Looks at where energy is coming from and where it is going to 
	- There is no single answer of a thing we need to fix or decrease power contribution. We have to have a holistic approach. 
- Where do GHGS come from 
	- epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions 
	- There are many causes, cow farts are only one of them. 
- What are the GHGS
	- epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions 
	- CO2 lasts for hundreds of years in the atmosphere. 
	- MH4 only lasts for around 12 years 
	- Methane is more damaging but doesn't last as long. A decreaseiin creating new GHGs will have near term benefits 
	- Others are HFCs, PFCs, SF and NF 
	- **Immediate reductions immediately makes things better** 
- Technical mechanisms for reducing pollution and removing carbon. 
	- We cannot recycle our way out of this mess. 
- Computer more cleanly 
	- Computers are estimated to consume 50% of global energy by 2040 
	- Make it more power efficient 
	- Use fewer materials, extend the llifecycle; make more recyclable 
	- Use green energy for data centers. 
	- Can colocate data centers with green power 
	- Can also transform that heat into other useful things 
- Solor panels in space aren't the solution 
	- It would require thousands of such launches unrealistic

- Nuclear power is not the answer 
	- the minerals are a problem to handle and are their own pollution 
	- Number of new nuclear plants between 1978 and 2013? 0 
	- 2 since 2013. 
	- safety and storage concerns might be addressed, but 10 to 20 years to bring one online and they are very expensive. 
- Misinformation and disinformation - information engineering for social good 
	- Correct information take a long time to distribute. 
		- Needs to be explained 
		- can't just be a sound bite 
	- Is intentionally looking authoritive 
	- easy to share 
	- sources may be deceiving or incorrect or misrepresented 
	- Often crafted for micro audiences - very appealing for sharing and consumption, tends towards confirmation bias. 
	- likely to create an emotional response 
	- Electric vehicle examples 
		- Misinformation: EVs pollute more than gas vehicles 
		- Disinformation: EVs are a symptom of the gov't tryingtto take away our freedom 
		- Correct information: complicated 
		- The full picture includes theeenergy needed and GHG emissions for materials, transport, human ccost, conflict minerals, indentured labor habitat loss 
		- Batteries are expensive and bad for the environment processes, rare difficult to obtain minerals, to produce like most embedded energy 
		- The bottom line is indeed favorable but by a smaller margin. 
- Opportunities 
	- Improve information literacy 
- Modeling and simulation - 
	- observation is input to modeling 
	- ECMWF
	- ecmwf.int 
- Improve versimilitude of forecasts 
- improve observational data 
- Increase computational power put against it.
	- better algos, more efficency 
- Improve awareness 
- Invoke social change 
- Food science 
- industrial / agriculture efficiency improvements 
- Response and resilience 
	- disruption happens, hackers are here to help. 
- How can biological systems help? 
- Ecology, understand vast and micro biomes 
- An End to the Climate Emergency is in our Grasp - Cory Doctorow, pluralistic.net.
