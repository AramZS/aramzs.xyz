# Explosive Overflow 

- Mark El-Khoury 
- Book: Security Chaos Engineering 
- Starts with Standards & Guidelines which show intent. 
- Considers culture as well
	- Usability 
	- Psychological safety 
	- Avoid adding friction
	- Maintain pleseant culture 
- Formal methods 
	- doing formal verification 
	- Create a mathematical model oftthe program 
	- proving the at program works as intended 
	- Continuous Formal Verification of Amazon s2n 
	- Limites - proving that the binary is correct 
	- Ken Thompson's "Reflections on Trust"
- Improving interoperability between Rust and C++ <- Google blog 
- The EU space engenc caught some errors but was constrained on what errors to catch. 
	- Assumed the backup would work 
	- Ariane 4 to Ariane 5 - don't change software that worked before <- assumed 
	- The view had been taken that the software works until it is proven to be false 
	- They changed it to be that the software is assumed faulty untiliit can be demonstrated that it is correct. 
	- Ariane 5 was running from the 90s through 2023 
- Overflow errors 
	- Therac-25 
	- Godel's incompletness theorems 
- The questions : does a program halt, is a program secure? 
- The Ada programming language was once required because of the memory guarantees 
- Bugs in our code, how do we show them? 
	- Static Analysis (SAST)  
		- Lacks context about *should* it be done this way even if it is done correctly. 
		- Brakeman is great for Ruby 
		- The biggest mistake is not triaging security findings. 
		- Combine findings by category and remidation 
- SEL4 is a Formally Verified Kernal 
- gcc and clang support - fsanitize=undefined flag
