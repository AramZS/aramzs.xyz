- SubleCrypto interface of the Web Crypto API is a big improvement but the other person must have a key 
	- Not all algos for encryption are supported. 
- How do you validate that it is not malicious? 
	- That is the biggest problem 
	- If a person can execute a different version and you don't check 
	- A modified version with a key logger could leak the password 
- Risk: Browsers could depreciate the APIs 
	- Store a copy of an at-that-time browser 
	- You could set up a way to self-validate the file 
- There is a URL encoded payload (blob) that occurs when you click `Save secret.html`
- It would be cool if it could send the the way to send the next secret along with the secret, but not yet a feature. 
- You can brute force outside the browser. 
- Shared 4 things that can answer the hints with his wife and that is the password. 
- Bcrypt not supported by Web Crypto APIs. 
- USB drives die all the time - that is a problem. 
	- Sometimes put stuff online. 
- Not great for storing large files. 
- How does it react to bad passwords?
