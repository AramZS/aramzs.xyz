- Kody Kinzie
- Example events 
	- Null Space Labs Workshops
	- Missoula Makerspace Classes 
	- Cyber Montana: Cybercat Academy
	- Toorcamp 2024 
- Null Byte & Hak5 teaching people via YouTube 
- Raspberry Pis were low cost, but it has gone up 
- Switched to microcontrollers 
- Started off discouraging for beginners 
- The Chicken Man Game - Microcontrollers where they intercept messages coming to and from 
- The list of assumptions of Arduino classes 
	- They can access their serial ports 
	- work with a command line interface 
	- get a compiler working 
	- flash to the microcontrollers 
	- install Arduino, import libraries and boards
	- has a good USB cable 
	- enjoys the above 
- Game Changers
	- WebSerial 
		- connect over a chrome based browser to the microcontroller and can do all sorts of stuff with it 
		- randomnerdtutorials.com 
		- Can flash a microcontroller with a compiled Bin file 
		- communicate over serial 
		- project organization 
		- flashing and learning on thessame website	
	- Circuit Python 
		- let's people make changes immediately and get feedback 
		- Interpreted 
		- flash once, never compile 
		- easy to control hardware 
		- drag and drop text editor 
		- easy for beginners to learn 
		- experiance is smooth 
		- Some limitations for experienced devs 
- Useful hardware 
	- esp8266
		- no native USB
		- supports WLED
		- wifi supports supports packet injection
		- only can see wifi packet metadata 
		- Arduino, micropython
		- no circuitpython
	- esp32s2
		- Native USB, mounts as USBdrive
		- support for circuit python, Arduino, micropython 
		- No packet injection perfect for HID/BadUSB attacks
		- Has Wifi but does not support several types of attacks 
		- single core 
		- Good core for other projects 
	- esp32s3 
		- Native USB, mounts as USBdrive 
		- Supports Bluetooth 
		- Dual Core 
		- Supports Meshtastic 
		- Wifi but does not support several attacks 
		- perfect for HID/BadUSB attacks 
		- no packet injection 
		- 
	- Pi Pico / Pi Pico W 
		- Native USB mounts as drive 
		- No packet injection 
		- Perfect for HID/BadUSB 
		- Has wifi but does not support several types of attacks 
		- Single Core 
		- Spark(something) makes a good board for them. 
- 5 day Cybercat Academy camp
	- soldering and simple board and leads 
	- Discuss ethics early on and teach that access to computers only comes with permissions 
	- IOT Light Boxes with WLED 
		- Supports WLED for wifi control of the lights 
		- Use warm white for diffusers not cold white
		- Some candy for "finding" their lost Nugget on the network
		- Need access to 3D printers
	- Hexleaf project on Thingiverse 
		- Need access to 3D printers 
		- Use even cheaper Led strips
	- IOT Purrsheens 
		- Glows from within 
		- hybrid materials 
		- Could get with a long weight in bulk from Aliexpress 
- Beginner focused microcontroller dev boards 
	- USB Nugget is a hardware tool that makes Microcontrollers east to learn 
	- Powered by ESP32s2 
	- a wifi enabled microcontroller 
	- Teaches Bad USB attacks 
	- Teach programming 
		- circuit [[Python]] micro [[Python]] arduino 
	- Control hardware / sensors 
	- Run community projects 
	- wifi and networking 
	- has a little screen and control. 
	- CatScratch Compatible 
	- Build-in flash drive storage 
	- can execute attacks plugged into your phone 
	- Quick payload deployment 
	- wifi control 
	- built in demos 
	- Inspiration - Deauther Watch 
	- Nugget.dev 
		- integrates web serial 
		- offers immediately available projects 
- Bad USB scripting class was a breakout star for the camp 
	- Kids took devices home, wrote more scripts unprompted 
	- Kids learned serial terminal commands to run memes - 
		- ctrl alt t 
		- wait 1000 
		- curl parrot.live 
		- wait 2000 
		- enter 
	- CircuitPython was not successful 
		- Flashing erased scripts
		- Students used rpis which unzipped files differently 
		- hard time copying and pasting files 
		- now we prepare a model device and save it's flash memory as a bin file. 
		- Students download the bin and flash it via nugget.dev 
	- Personalization motivated them to learn 
	- Generated stickers 
		- Used stickerapp
	- Good feedback 
- Wifi hacking self-defense was a big hit conceptually. People are more often interested in securing themselves.
