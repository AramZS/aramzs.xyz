- [Home - Distributed Denial of Secrets](https://ddosecrets.com/)
- Began in 2018. 
- How it works in theory 
	- Data received and verified 
	- public interest? 
	- No interest for the public? Discard. 
	- Yes? 
		- Look for PII 
		- If no -> publish a torrent 
		- If yes -> May publish if there is already a version floating out there in order to reduce harm from potential incomplete versions floating around 
		- If yes and the PII can't be stripped - it is announced as reserved - usable only by proven people who have shown they can handle it well. 
		- If it can be stripped we publish it redacted. 
- Pretty small group - Pac Man Rule - The Open Circle Principle 
- Time to split up - the fundraising isn't working 
	- Keep Leaks Alive 
	- very hard to raise money for Leaks publishing 
	- Crowd funding hasn't been very successful 
	- Impacts our ability to serve and protect sources 
- Split into 
	- Library of Leaks 
		- redactions , archive, distro 
		- Welcome in more participants 
	- Disclosure without Borders 
		- source protection 
		- embargoes 
		- collabs 
		- smaller circle of trust 
- New release 
	- Ganosec Israel Defense Forces 
- Hunter 
	- a fork of Aleph-provided searchengine focused on harm reduction 
	- Now a login service for journalists to prevent it from being taken down. 
- Dealing with incidents around password sharing, especially when sources have data they want reserved. 
- Breaches 
	- We can't have the journalists sharing passwords - but shared among newsrooms 
	- Journalists got hacked 
	- Phishing attacks with fake journalists emails. 
	- Overworked volunteers making user errors 
- Introducing - the Leaks Library Card
	- Physical MFA 
	- Helps prevent Phishing 
	- Card holders become voting members 
	- Not just for journalists 
	- data.ddossecrets.com is public 
	- The other data sets require a Leaks Library Card 
	- We think this space should teach people how to do journalism 
	- People who can demonstrate research methodology we will verify you and send you a card
	- Formalizing the process will help engage more people with opinions about things 
- Library of Leaks 
	- Now larger than the library of congress 
	- hoping people volunteer 
- Board of Advisors is being wound down and replacing it with organizers 
	- Need people who are closer to the process 
	- Experience to bring:
		- Specialized topics 
		- language experiance 
		- 60 countrys in the archive so far 
		- Documentation - style guide, dataset descriptions scripts for processing data sets, visualizations
		- Fundraising - grant writers, event organizers, designers
		- Help maintain and develop 
			- search.ddosecrets.com 
			- Other stuff 
- We don't own Leaks and there are big ones we don't have 
	- Looking for people to donate the Leaks to the library 
- Disclosure without Borders 
	- Will take subscriptions 
	- New working group absorbs Adopt a Hacker. And other legal defence campaigns.
	- Take subscriptions from those who monetize the library. 
		- For anyone who wants an embargoes 
	- Newsletter on Open Collective 
	- Easier to join the Library of Leaks as a volunteer tho. 
- Work with International Consortium of Investigative Journalists is particularly notable.
- "Luanda Leaks whistleblowers Rui Pinto faces fresh charges but may benefit from amnesty reforms time to coincide with papal visit"

- Source protection 
	- Very much a case by case basis 
- Journalists repeatedly push to out the source 
- NICAR sessions run on dealing with leaks but maybe opportunity to partner with journalists here (potentially for pay )
	- Bottleneck is while we know how to do some thing we don't know how to teach things to people 
	- Makes it hard to run classes 
- Looking to expand hosting. 
	- Can't rely on most data centers in most juristictions 
	- There is a guide on the website on how to mirror the data en-mass. 
- Potential internet archive opportunity? 
- Never worked directly for the gov't (weird question)
- We work with people and if the background is clear we'll keep working with people
