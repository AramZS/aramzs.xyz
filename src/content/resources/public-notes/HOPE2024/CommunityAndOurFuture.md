# Our Communities, Resiliency, Our Future

- Chaos Communications Camp 
	- lesson in building your own hackerspace 
	- went from there in 2007 to create NYC Resistor, Noisebridge, HacDC. 
- 70 hackerspace in 2007 to 6,000+ now 
	- hackerspaces.org 
- Financial crisis in 2008 made spaces affordable 
- Generated small businesses 
- Contributed to the local economy. 
- Circuit Hacking Mondays helped bring people into the community 
- All cultures must have checks and balances built in to keep out the worst behaviors of humanity. 
- Our one rule - subjective by design - be excellent to each other. 
	- We have to keep talking about it consistently, intentionally 
	- A huge part of making community resilient to the ups and downs 
	- and there will be ups and downs. 
- Noisebridge (some problems we hit)
	- Helped with occupy wall st 
		- After, a bunch of unexcellent behavior from people at Noisebridge where they were abusing the community. 
		- Vandalizing people, too many taking who were not giving 
		- Politely kicking people out was not working 
		- Had to Reboot in 2013 - kicked everyone out and only allowed people back in who were contributing. 
		- Had to create a Cultural Immune System 
			- Attract what? Repel what? 
		- A big project at least once a year is a great way to bring people together?. 
			- Teaches that they are a part of the community 
		- anniversary was good
	- Callout Culture is VERY effective but some people use it badly and it is really hard to talk about. 
		- Be empathetic
		- Reach out personally 
		- Be respectful
