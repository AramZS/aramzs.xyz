# AI, Solarpunk, and an Uncertain Future in Computing

- rolltime 
- Presentation is linked somewhere. 
- [Site Unreachable](https://rollti.me/)
- Talked about [[Products/ActivityPub]] 
	- Good YouTube talk to look up
- Our relationship with technology is broken
- Approximate multipliers to challenge the mainstream. 
- Transformer model took over from previous AI approaches 
	- More data 
	- More hardware 
	- these now scale 
- AlphaFold 3 being used for genetics work 
- Around 30% of people use ChatGPT weekly (? Source? )
- AI Bad for energy demand 
	- Training GPT4 is 2500 flights
	- ChatGPT > 100 flights per day 
	- AI Powered Search is 30TWh potentially 
	- Google's carbon emissions up 48% 
- What do we do about it? 
- Density can be good 
- Sofi - Acorn Land Labs - produces music 
- Instead of centering our designs around Latency and Speed - what if we design around energy - solar protocol. 
- [Solar Protocol](http://solarprotocol.net/) 
	- Energy centered 
	- Planet scale 
	- Naturally Intelligent 
	- Collaborative 
	- permacomputing 
- Efficient deep learning 
	- What do we mean by efficient? 
	- Reduce compute? 
	- Techniques in either/or Quantized or Pruned AIs, AMs
		- Reduce memory
		- Reduce FLOPs 
		- Reduce power 
		- Zero-shot 
		- Equal Performance 
	- multiplication is one of the least efficient things computers do
	- Binary log is more efficient but not precise. 
	- Massive energy savings for doing AMs 
	- AlexNet is a large useful test model 
	- What's the catch? 
		- Threatens NVIDA's monopoly 
		- Model Size/Speed 
- Energy Centric Design is a way of assuring that technology can have appositive impact on the world without destroying the environment
