title: All These Years - Mixed by DJ Sabrina The Teenage DJ
---
<p>I found real enjoyment in the latest DJ Sabrina the Teenage DJ album. The whole thing, which the creator intended to be listened to continuously as one long track, is great. The opening track caught my attention right away, blending songs so finely and with distinct song parts rendered out of the combination of music, beats and speech samples.</p>
<p>I find that, though it isn't a bad thing at all, a lot of the <a href="https://songobsessed.com/tag/plunderphonics/" class="hxlink" hx-boost="true" hx-swap="outerHTML show:top" hx-target="#main-content" hx-select="#main-content" hx-push-url="true">plunderphonics</a> tracks can come out as a meshing of distinct parts. These can be a lot of fun to listen to, sometimes partially to try and pick up the parts. They can also occasionally be a little distracting, where the shift between parts becomes noticeable. Some DJs/artists may even be doing that intentionally. That's not the case here. The saxophone motif runs in the background while the beat speeds up and slows down in concert with layers of mixed in sound. Fragments of voice tracks are used like instruments to parallel various layers of music in an effect that makes the feeling of listening to this conversational, light, airy and not at all distracting.</p>
<p>There's these wonderful 90s sounds that fit the theme that feel nostalgic but also brand new, at the 56 second mark there's this use of voices and sound right before the beat speeds up that feels somehow like a memory of watching 90s music videos manufactured new, and also a perfect transition into the new rhythm. A feat repeated at the bridge from 2:20 to 2:55 as well, with an impressive mix of voices taking the forefront in a way that barely sounds vocal at all.</p>
<p>I really enjoy the fundamental feel of this song, the mix of throw-back and modern approaches, and the creativity of the mix. I recommend <a href="https://djsabrinatheteenagedj.bandcamp.com/album/fantasy" class="external-link" target="_blank">the whole album</a>, and this is a great start.</p>
