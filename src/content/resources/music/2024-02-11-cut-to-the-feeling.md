  80s throwbacks are easier to come by in pop and rock than ever, but they're
  rarely this fun

title: Cut to the Feeling

<p>Maybe it's just coming back from a fun near week of vacation, or maybe it is the feeling of wanting to be done with this long trip back on a train that keeps falling behind schedule but I'm really feeling this song right now. I've been liking a lot of the 80s throwback feel as it has been popping up in pop lately, and especially here and from Miley Cyrus in Plastic Hearts.</p>
<p>Jepsen has always been bright in her music but this track in particular is just so much fun and I like the lyrics. We all have felt this way, impatient to get through the slow, the boring, the hard, just wanting to cut to that feeling.</p>
