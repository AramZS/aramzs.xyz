<p>I stumbled on Totem while exploring <a href="https://songobsessed.com/tag/french-electropop" class="external-link" target="_blank">French-language electropop</a> and the song has stuck near the top of my charts for weeks. The song is just incredibly energetic and really drives forward, with a huge variety of musical textures.</p>
<p>Since then I've been coming back to it and other songs by Franco-Malian music collective Lamomali. <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamomali" class="external-link" target="_blank">Lamomali came about through</a> the combination of French singer-songwriter Matthieu Chedid, griot Toumani Diabaté, and diva Fatoumata Diawara.</p>
<p>The song, from what I can tell by reading the translated-from-French sources is focused on the idea of a griot: a word for a West African storyteller, holder of oral traditions and wandering musician and poet. The collective utopian-pop group includes <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toumani_Diabat%C3%A9" class="external-link" target="_blank">Diabaté</a>, who is apparently a very renown <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kora" class="external-link" target="_blank">Kora</a> player.</p>
<p>The song talks about being a griot from a family of griots, how one learns, and the question of the totem, an object that provides a source of inspiration, or--the lyrics ask--is the inspiration from within? 'Am I the totem of myself?'</p>
<p>The song switches around from what sounds like spoken parts by Diabaté, strongly sung parts by individuals and by the group during the chorus, and a whispery tone during some other parts.</p>
<p>I love how the music just <em>moves</em>. It isn't just foot-tapping, it has an acceleration that the beat and mix use to propel me forward.</p>
<p>I'm sure I'm getting some, if not all, wrong about the origin and nature of the song. I'm just trying to scrape together auto-translated texts to understand what's going on. But the music is unmistakably good. The lightweight strings of the kora and the guitar work blend together to make a sound that I keep thinking about after the song ends. Thee are a few great guitar riffs from Chedid that really pop out in successive listens. I really recommend watching <a href="https://youtu.be/onkO3sRdaEc" class="external-link" target="_blank">their live performance at France Inter Studio 104</a> to see it all come together! It's wild to see this collection of artists, including featured artist Yamê, also do some truly impressive things with their voices too.</p>
<p>I can't recommend the whole album enough, I've been listening to more and more of this group's music and it's all great, but this song keeps me coming back.</p>
<p>I think there's so much fun new and really invigorating and different experiences out there for me as someone who only speaks English and doesn't get exposed to a lot of non-American music without trying to find it. New instruments, new styles, different topics and ideas, I love encountering these by trying to listen to music outside my normal comfort zone, this track is a great example of why to do that work. As the translation of one line says &quot;It's not AI, it's art.&quot;</p>
