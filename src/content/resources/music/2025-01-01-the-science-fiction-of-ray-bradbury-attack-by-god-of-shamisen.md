  A really great example of music that takes the Shamisen and rocks with it in a
  modern context.

<p>I've been getting into <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7fqvCTtfHqSVNw2b2T3WjR?si=6b5d81b685984bab" class="external-link" target="_blank">music made with a variety of instruments unique to the Asian continent</a>. I got introduced via BlueSky to a few more Shamisen-focused bands and God Of Shamisen was one of them. This song really moves and I've very much enjoyed listening to it. I love hearing more different types of instruments so if you have suggestions, reach out on BlueSky and let me know!</p>
