<p><a href="https://www.supergiantgames.com/games/pyre/" class="external-link" target="_blank">Pyre</a> was such a weird game but once I figured it out I couldn't put it down. Korb is a particularly good composer, but this album blows me out of the water every time I listen to it. I think it is his best work thus far, not yet overshadowed by his more recent--still great--work.</p>
<p>You should listen to the whole album and also, you should play the game. I understand that not many people played through, but it is absolutely worth it.</p>
