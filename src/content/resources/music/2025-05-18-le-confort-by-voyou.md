<p>I've been on a bit of <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/50i7XDr9Q74FV3uNikdKQI?si=894f0be8b81543f8" class="external-link" target="_blank">a French electropop kick lately</a>. I stumbled into a few songs in a suggested tracks area of some other playlist and found I was going down a hole I liked and kept saving songs from that until I got to about 45 minutes of playlist, which I've been trying to enhance with additional suggestions from Spotify.</p>
<p>I've found the playlist-based recommendations in Spotify a little chancy lately, which is a shame because it <em>was</em> the best feature of using the platform. However, I suspect that French electropop is so well established that it's able to do recommendations a little more effectively than in some more obscure genres.</p>
<p>This song is a lot of fun, one of those where it comes on and you don't even notice as you start moving around to the music. The sound mix reminds me a lot of <a href="https://songobsessed.com/songs/sorry-by-gatc/" class="external-link" target="_blank">Sorry by GATC</a>, another great song.</p>
<p>It is a surprisingly bright song considering that, according to the translations I could find at least, it is about falling out of love with someone. I think you can sort of hear it in the deeper more discordant notes that run under the whole song. The chorus is a hell of a lot of fun though, as is the synth work.</p>
<p>There's something about that brassy chorus that makes this sone irresistible to me, and gives the whole track a sort of bounding energy, like the singer is not just falling out of love but already on the rebound.</p>
<p>I've tried out a few more tracks by Voyou and while many of them are pretty good, few hit me and make me move like this one. I just want more energy out of these types of tracks than in most of Voyou's other work. That said, I'm going to dig into this album and their back catalog for sure, along with expanding out my French electropop playlist.</p>
