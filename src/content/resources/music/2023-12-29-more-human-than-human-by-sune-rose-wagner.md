<p>So the original song here is by <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/1NbJFhkVdD47YZ2IojKkJi?si=1628e631da7c4a66" class="external-link" target="_blank">White Zombie</a>. It sounds basically like you'd expect one of White Zombie's better tracks to sound. This cover is apparently by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sune_Rose_Wagner" class="external-link" target="_blank">Sune Rose Wagner</a>. Wagner is a Danish rocker and producer I'm entirely unfamiliar with. I'm not sure how he got involved in the soundtrack for <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80097140" class="external-link" target="_blank">Altered Carbon</a>, or if this is an original for it.</p>
<p>In either case I really like how the cover plays with the ideas that are common to Rob Zombie's work while being very distinct from it. The horror-film piano opening is great, especially in-context with the show and it feels almost like the sort of choice Zombie might make (though with a lot more heavy sound) and the electronic distorted vocals are a particularly cyberpunk-esque touch on the type of less-distinguishable vocals that Zombie often uses.</p>
<p>I'm not a big White Zombie or Rob Zombie fan though he's a leader of his genre for sure. That type of music just isn't in my usual rotation. But this fits my tastes well.</p>
