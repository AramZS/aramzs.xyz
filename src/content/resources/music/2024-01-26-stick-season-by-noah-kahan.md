<p>Look there's no arguing with this song. When you start listening to it some part of your body is going to start hopping or tapping. It's inescapable.</p>
<p>Found this song through <a href="https://youtu.be/TAgX-DgdzZ0?si=szYWpJKNeHOwuZzm" class="external-link" target="_blank">Todd in the Shadows end of the year review</a> which highlighted the equally great, though <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Noah+Kahan/_/Dial+Drunk+(with+Post+Malone)" class="external-link" target="_blank">more popular single with Post Malone</a>. I dove right into the album and instantly loved the whole thing.</p>
<p>Apparently this isn't my first encounter with Noah Kahan though, back in 2019 I was deep in... let's call it the 'sad girl with a ukelele' genre. I listened to a lot of <a href="https://songobsessed.com/artist/mxmtoon" class="hxlink" hx-boost="true" hx-swap="outerHTML show:top" hx-target="#main-content" hx-select="#main-content" hx-push-url="true">mxmtoon</a>, who is my break-away away favorite of all the musicians I explored at the time. I even saw her live, which was a little weird, that's likely the largest the age difference average has ever been between me and the majority of concertgoers at a show. Apparently they did a duet called <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Noah+Kahan/_/Pride+(with+mxmtoon)" class="external-link" target="_blank">Pride</a> together that is pretty great and that is the first time I listened to anything having to do with Noah Kahan, it hit well for the tail end of Big COVID Times.</p>
<p>Todd made the point that this falls into a particular class of stomp and clap music like Mumford and Sons and <a href="https://songobsessed.com/artist/the-lumineers" class="hxlink" hx-boost="true" hx-swap="outerHTML show:top" hx-target="#main-content" hx-select="#main-content" hx-push-url="true">The Lumineers</a> that he called &quot;hat music&quot; in the sense that usually the singer or band is wearing some sort of americana-esque hat. I like that. I don't think I can listen to that style of music all the time, but I enjoy the hell out of the highlights.</p>
