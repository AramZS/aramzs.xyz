<p>Andreya Triana has been showing up on my playlists more and more as of late.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.andreyatriana.com/" class="external-link" target="_blank">Triana</a> has a wide genre range, along with a gorgeous voice which fits well in all of them. A lot of her work overlaps with <a href="https://songobsessed.com/tag/soul/" class="hxlink" hx-boost="true" hx-swap="outerHTML show:top" hx-target="#main-content" hx-select="#main-content" hx-push-url="true">soul</a>, <a href="https://songobsessed.com/tag/randb/" class="hxlink" hx-boost="true" hx-swap="outerHTML show:top" hx-target="#main-content" hx-select="#main-content" hx-push-url="true">R&amp;B</a>, <a href="https://songobsessed.com/tag/pop/" class="hxlink" hx-boost="true" hx-swap="outerHTML show:top" hx-target="#main-content" hx-select="#main-content" hx-push-url="true">pop</a> and <a href="https://songobsessed.com/tag/jazz/" class="hxlink" hx-boost="true" hx-swap="outerHTML show:top" hx-target="#main-content" hx-select="#main-content" hx-push-url="true">jazz</a>. A few folks identify her as &quot;soul pop&quot;. She has a bunch of tracks that fit well within a genre I call &quot;clang pop&quot; but this is the one that sits most firmly among <a href="https://songobsessed.com/tag/clang-pop/" class="hxlink" hx-boost="true" hx-swap="outerHTML show:top" hx-target="#main-content" hx-select="#main-content" hx-push-url="true">other clang pop tracks</a>. I'm not sure clang pop is a genre term anyone else uses, but I find it makes a good unifier for songs with pop inclinations who distinguish themselves with a strong use of percussion, bells, brassy sounds, chimes, and other more rhythm-section elements, along with non-standard electronic distortion-style sounds, all of which are in here. I tend to especially think of a song as clang pop when the rhythmic elements are used off the main beat in a way that gives the songs a little big of discord and disorder.</p>
<p>The off-beat pop sound has clearly worked for her as, if you don't live in the UK, there's a good chance you may have heard her work in a commercial or TV show, where they seem to get used frequently. It's attention grabbing music, so I can see why.</p>
<p>I enjoy the variety of Triana's work. At some point, according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andreya_Triana" class="external-link" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>, she seems to have been performing with the group Jungle, which is also a sort of pop/soul/something-else group and seems like a good fit. (I like their music quite a bit, but I'm seeing I've never had them on my obsessions list, something to fix soon.) I encourage checking <a href="https://andreyatriana.bandcamp.com/" class="external-link" target="_blank">her other work out</a> and, if you like this sound, maybe look at some of the other <a href="https://songobsessed.com/tag/clang-pop/" class="hxlink" hx-boost="true" hx-swap="outerHTML show:top" hx-target="#main-content" hx-select="#main-content" hx-push-url="true">clang pop</a> songs I've selected in the past.</p>
