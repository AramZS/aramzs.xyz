<p>I just love how this song is well-put-together punk and at about the 2/3rds point it drops into a punk cover of the theme song of Stephen Universe. I love it. I can't say any more than that. Either you're going to adore that conceptually and be totally into this song or you're not and I can't explain why its great to you.</p>
