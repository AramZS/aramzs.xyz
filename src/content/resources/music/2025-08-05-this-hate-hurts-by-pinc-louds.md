title: This Hate Hurts by Pinc Louds
---
<p>From the opening note This Hate Hurts caught my attention.</p>
<p>This is typical for the Pinc Louds whose unique vocalist Claudi caught my attention immediately when they were one of the acts at a Sofar around 5 years ago. The speakeasy space behind a clothing store is gone, the clothing store is gone, the block it was on, right near Brooklyn Bowl, has significantly gentrified. But the song the Pinc Louds opened with has remained in my playlist since. As have others they've put out since.</p>
<p>This Hate Hurts really kicks up the production however, and while this song (the third single off their new album &quot;You Can't Eat the Moon and Be a Werewolf Too&quot; set to drop this month) no doubt benefits from being mixed and produced by Gordon Raphael who produced The Strokes, you can't mistake that marimba sound cutting through the crashing synths. The combination makes the track unmistakably Pinc Louds.</p>
<p>It's a hell of a track too, dense, thick with the feelings described in the lyrics. I immediately wanted to move, nod, yell and listen to it again. When it all comes cascading down towards the end I knew I had to make it my obsession for this week.</p>
<p>The last few years have really swung my musical preferences towards denser and denser tracks and I'm often in the mood for something a but more crunchier than the Pinc Louds first album, so to have them drop this track now where it fits in perfectly with my preferences lately is a real joy. I've got the track on repeat and you should try giving it more than one listen too.</p>
<p>A perfect track for the present moment. I can't want for the full album to drop!</p>
