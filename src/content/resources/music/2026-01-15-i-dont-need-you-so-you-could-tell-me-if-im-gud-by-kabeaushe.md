title: 'I DON''T NEED YOU, SO YOU COULD TELL ME IF I''M GUD by KABEAUSHÉ'

<p>Damn, have you ever had a song just grab hold of you and take over your brain? You just want more and more, like an addition? I've become addicted to &quot;I DON'T NEED YOU, SO YOU COULD TELL ME IF I'M GUD&quot;.</p>
<p>I've listened to a few songs in the past by KABEAUSHÉ but this one made me really pay attention and loop back to the artist and start listening more in depth. <a href="https://soundcloud.com/kabeaushe/sets/lifes-waaaaaaay-too?utm_source=clipboard&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=social_sharing" class="external-link" target="_blank">The EP</a> this is off of &quot;LIFE'S WAAAAAAAY TOO FLEEEEETEEN'&quot; is a three track banger. It's stuffed full of fascinating attention grabbing choices with a mix of drum beats, brassy sequences, pop sounds, and little classical beats all combined in an electronic music framework.</p>
<p>I had to <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/KABEAUSH%C3%89/+wiki" class="external-link" target="_blank">find out more</a>, which is how I can tell you that though KABEAUSHÉ is Kenyan, they work with a Ugandan music collective Nyege Nyege, which seems to be focused mostly on electronic music. I listened to a few peers in that space and they're all interesting, with maybe <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/HHY+&amp;+The+Kampala+Unit" class="external-link" target="_blank">HHY &amp; The Kampala Unit</a> providing a close feel. I am looking forward to listening to more in the space and finding out more about it in the near future.</p>
<p>But while I'm on my way there, I'm listening to this track. There's something particularly special in this song, which is the first single off an upcoming album I'm not very much looking forward to. The combination of these classical sequences bridging the singing, the contrast with a more bit-tune musical sequence and the way that voice is used in a glitchy instrumental way makes the track incredibly engaging. It picks up fast and takes you along for a ride.</p>
<p>There's the feeling here of almost three, maybe even four songs, all overlapping, synced up with different starts and ends and combining into a glorious overture for KABEAUSHÉ short bursts of song. The end result is just an incredibly fun and straight-up addictive listen. Highly recommend this track, the EP, and more by the artist.</p>
