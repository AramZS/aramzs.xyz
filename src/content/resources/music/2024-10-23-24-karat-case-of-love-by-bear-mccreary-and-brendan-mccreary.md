<p>I <a href="https://letterboxd.com/aramzs/film/the-4-30-movie/" class="external-link" target="_blank">really liked The 4:30 Movie</a>! As Kevin Smith goes through the various phases of his life he produces very different types of films and some of them I've liked and others I haven't. This is the first of his films that felt like a nice warm hug. Smith has been a dad for a while now, but I understand from interviews that this is his first film sober in a while and I guess it allows his sentimentality to come through a little more genuinely in this nice sweet period piece of a film. His collaboration with Bear McCreary on the soundtrack manages to feel much the same way. It's like the 1980s coming through with the nicest rose-colored glasses possible.</p>
<p>This song is the peak, with sweet 80s saxophones, somewhat silly lyrics, but a whole lot of fun and heart. It feels distinctively <em>like the film</em> in a way that I'm not sure I've encountered outside of well... other 80s films. I just love the song, it feels tactilely good. It recommends itself and the film effectively.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Somewhere out there I've been hearing this love song&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It also feels like McCreary and his brother are tapping into their own nostalgia and a bit of their own schmaltz on this song. Like the film, it feels like a creation that someone had fun putting together. I feel like that is an undervalued quality these days, and one that seems rarer all the time.</p>
