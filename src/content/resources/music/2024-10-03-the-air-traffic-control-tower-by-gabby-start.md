<p>This song feels almost like a logical evolution from some of the music I've been listening to lately, it has the soothing repetitive musical logic of <a href="https://songobsessed.com/songs/the-pattern-by-the-narcissist-cookbook/" class="external-link" target="_blank">the Pattern</a> and the interesting use of electronic and hyperpop sounds of <a href="https://songobsessed.com/songs/catherine-never-broke-again-by-saoirse-dream/" class="external-link" target="_blank">catherine never broke again</a>. In some ways it is musically closer to pop than either of the songs. The main beat is (most of the time) pretty standard and more relaxed than hyperpop-style music but more traditionally musical than The Narcissist Cookbook.</p>
<p>I don't really know the artist very well, this came out of a algorithmic recommendation on my <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5359cLeAX40tJUS4ysDOlm?si=75052b75c8d94301" class="external-link" target="_blank">Hyper Emo Noise</a> playlist which is mostly music that Spotify calls '5th wave emo', whatever that means. It doesn't fit on that playlist though, it's far too relaxed. I find the lyrics are more interested in musicality than sense, which is fun and interesting. I also really like how hard to square into a single genre it is, not just because it feels like 2, maybe 3, songs, especially at about 3:10 where it briefly dives into what is almost a completely different song.</p>
<p>The soothing sound of the chorus is itself almost from a different piece of music, with a smoothness and unexpectedly organized sound that almost feels like it is coming straight from a Sufjan Stevens song.</p>
<p>Overall, a song that is hard to describe but feels like it is actively doing something strange but highly enjoyable to my brain every time I hear it. It feels, perhaps intentionally, like a getting pleasantly high. The lyrics make it sound almost like you are sitting on a couch in college with your friendly neighborhood dealer talking nonsense also while you're both pleasantly high. I'm going to bet this song isn't for everyone, but it's really my jam right now.</p>
<p>Also I enjoy that this song feels like a round (even if it isn't). I sort of want to play it on a loop three different times at three different start points and see how it goes.</p>
