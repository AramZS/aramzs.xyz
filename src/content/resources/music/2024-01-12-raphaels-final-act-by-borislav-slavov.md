  Slavov has long been a master of video game scores, but having one of the
  characters sing their own boss music is great

<p>Borislav Slavov has been in my playlists since I first heard his work in the last Larian game (the first I played) Divinity: Original Sin 2. He seems to mostly work with Larian in producing video game sound tracks and they've always been stand out work. Slavov has a tendency to leverage a fantasy sound to produce some noticeable but well-integrated tracks for video games.</p>
<p>You can hear that in his instrument choices here and even in the way the music references through instrumentation choices both the fantasy setting and gives a lot of information about the character themselves.</p>
<p>This isn't the first time <a href="https://songobsessed.com/artist/borislav-slavov/" class="hxlink" hx-boost="true" hx-swap="outerHTML show:top" hx-target="#main-content" hx-select="#main-content" hx-push-url="true">Slavov</a> has shown up on this list, nor is it the first of <a href="https://songobsessed.com/songs/sing-for-me-lohse-version-by-borislav-slavov/" class="hxlink" hx-boost="true" hx-swap="outerHTML show:top" hx-target="#main-content" hx-select="#main-content" hx-push-url="true">his vocal-focused tracks</a>. However, this is a fun one. Like <a href="https://songobsessed.com/songs/sing-for-me-lohse-version-by-borislav-slavov/" class="hxlink" hx-boost="true" hx-swap="outerHTML show:top" hx-target="#main-content" hx-select="#main-content" hx-push-url="true">&quot;Sing for Me&quot;</a>, it is a character in the game vocalizing their own music in character, but here it's sort of a campy, almost operatic track. I guess I should note that if you're playing the game, or planning to, it has some spoilers in it.</p>
<p>I know that this is a <em>particularly</em> nerdy pick for the site, but I've been listening to and enjoying it a lot. I don't know if it has the same impact without the context of having played the game but hopefully anyone can get some joy out of it.</p>
<p>There's a <a href="https://youtu.be/l1h5Zug84gw?si=N5VWfbqCnntGP5Jh" class="external-link" target="_blank">fun interview with the vocalist who is the voice actor behind the character</a> which I recommend. It's just one little slice of how much has gone into Baldur's Gate 3, which I've been playing a lot of. It's great!</p>
