<p>This is such a weird song to love, but it is just so toe-tappingly good. Every time I hear it I perk up. I've been trying to explore more of Guppy's discography but this is such a stand out for me.</p>
<p>I love how the song is paced, I love that it has a pick up instead of a drop and the lyrical flow is fantastic. I think there are some extremely choice rhymes here that just elevate the whole operation to make this song nearly addictive.</p>
<p>There's a lot of fun little couplets that pop out irresistibly. Especially the chorus. The way it ends with an 'Oh no'. I love it. The whole thing feels like an extremely modern version of CAKE's &quot;Short Skirt/Long Jacket&quot;, the immense sense of sarcasm that winds through both songs joins their together spiritually.</p>
<p>Also, cannot lie, I love the background screaming under &quot;I chose to believe them&quot;. What a sound! What a choice! Love it.</p>
