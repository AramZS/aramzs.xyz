<p>Back in 2021 music reviewer Claire Tran wrote <a href="https://vietcetera.com/en/a-beginners-guide-to-the-vietnamese-pop-punk-scene" class="external-link" target="_blank">this really excellent guide to Vietnam's expanding pop punk scene</a>. I stumbled on it and ended up not just exploring those tracks but the general return of the <a href="https://songobsessed.com/tag/pop-punk" class="hxlink" hx-boost="true" hx-swap="outerHTML show:top" hx-target="#main-content" hx-select="#main-content" hx-push-url="true">pop punk genre</a> that has been <a href="https://www.brooklynvegan.com/when-we-were-young-2023-set-times-blink-182-green-day-new-found-glory-the-offspring-more/" class="external-link" target="_blank">happening</a> over the last few years while getting back to some of my old favs that I'd forgotten about.</p>
<p>That said, I've particularly liked the vietnamese take on pop punk and the bands have continually been on my listening list, with one or two occasionally popping up on repeat. I've listened to them often enough that the Spotify algorithm has learned to recommend them to me in some contexts. That said, this comes of Tran's <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0pesmFQkYsb1H5tYy4r7Ly" class="external-link" target="_blank">playlist</a> and is a recommendation for all the rest that she put on there. It's just so much fun in the way pop punk should be.</p>
