Backreads is a project that's very much in the start phase. The goal is to build something that takes advantage of a serverless flow to build out interesting insights into [the many email newsletters I get](https://tweets.aramzs.com/809291407194255360/). 

This is an idea I've been [playing with](https://tweets.aramzs.com/716993969012473857/) for [a long time](https://tweets.aramzs.com/747825238075936768/). I think it's an interesting way to expose just how much news is out there, organize it in some way, and also help make sure it gets archived in some form.
