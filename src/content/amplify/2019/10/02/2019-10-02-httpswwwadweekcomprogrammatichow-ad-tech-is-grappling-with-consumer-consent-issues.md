<p>The IAB Tech Lab is proposing technical standards it hopes will ready its members for the fast-approaching California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, legislation geared toward shining a light on data brokerage and giving consumers more control over how ad tech accesses data.</p>
<p>The trade org has established a working group to prepare for the enactment of CCPA in January.</p>
<p>The legislation will place stringent limitations on how publishers can <a href="https://www.adweek.com/digital/4-ways-ad-tech-can-prepare-for-impending-state-privacy-laws/">grant third parties access to the consumer data of California residents</a> for the purpose of ad targeting. The CCPA also requires that consumers can opt out of allowing such businesses to sell their information to third parties, which is the cornerstone of programmatic media trading.</p>
