title: 'A Take Written by an Idiot, Signifying Nothing'

<p>Here’s the core of Cillizza’s argument (emphasis mine throughout):</p>
<blockquote>Given that the three frontrunners for the Democratic nod are septuagenarians, the age/health question has been a low buzz in the race from the start. <strong>But with Biden, Warren and Sanders keeping schedules that would exhaust this 43-year-old in about a day’s time, there’s been little to hang those worries on.</strong></blockquote>
<blockquote>That’s now changed — in a fundamental way. While Sanders and his campaign (and his supporters) are quick to downplay how serious (or not) this heart attack was for the Vermont senator, <strong>it’s hard to get away from this fact: Sanders, a 78-year-old man, had a heart attack that required surgery. </strong>While there are lots and lots of people who have this exact experience, most of them are not running for president. And no one disputes that being president — or even running for it — is a hugely stressful job.</blockquote>
<p>OK, sure, that fact about Sanders is indeed a fact. I’ll also agree that concerns about the advanced age of the Democratic field have been present from the jump. <a href="https://splinternews.com/help-i-cant-look-away-from-joe-bidens-bloody-eyeball-1837889368">But</a> I <a href="https://splinternews.com/the-devastating-weakness-of-joe-biden-1835937914">simply</a> <a href="https://splinternews.com/lets-play-back-that-insane-joe-biden-answer-about-racis-1838085233">don’t</a> <a href="https://splinternews.com/wtf-was-going-on-with-joe-bidens-teeth-1838084932">agree</a> that Biden’s behavior has provided “little to hang those worries” about. The argument here seems to be: Sanders’ heart?? Yikes!! What’s it mean?? No one knows!!</p>
<p>Cillizza then pivots to talking about polls—most Americans don’t want a president in their 70s, and yet that’s what we have! But polls? Wow, lots of other unknowns, not sure what to make of this! Bruce Springsteen though!</p>
<blockquote>There’s also some element of uncertainty built into polling about such a sensitive topic as age. Do people pull punches when talking about how much age matters to their vote when talking to a complete stranger in a poll? Do they actually care more than they would ever admit to a pollster?</blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>That’s a question we don’t know the answer to.</strong> Especially because some of these decisions and opinions may well be based on specific candidates and how they seem to be aging. <strong>After all, we know that one man’s 76 isn’t another man’s 76. Hell, </strong><a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/seven-thoughts-on-bruce-springsteen-his-70th-birthday-888688/">Bruce Springsteen is 70 </a><strong>and looks like he is about 50!</strong></blockquote>
<p>Great stuff! Whatever CNN is paying Cillizza is a bargain—keep up the heady work.</p>
