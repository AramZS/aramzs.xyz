<p>The <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/james-comey-memoir-tv-miniseries-deal-1145079">looming threat</a> of a TV or film adaption of former FBI Director James’ Comey’s book <em>A Higher Loyalty </em>now has a face, and that face is Jeff Daniels—of-fucking-course—as the hero <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/act-four/wp/2014/12/09/the-newsroom-is-the-worst-prestige-show-on-television/">once again</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://tvline.com/2019/10/07/jeff-daniels-james-comey-a-higher-loyalty-limited-series-cbs-showtime/">TVline.com reported the news</a> that Daniels would play Comey in the CBS Studios limited series based on the former FBI director’s memoir. It doesn’t yet have a release date, and I pray it stays that way. (A bit later, <a href="https://tvline.com/2019/10/07/brendan-gleeson-donald-trump-cast-james-comey-limited-series/">the site also reported</a> that Brendan Gleeson has been cast to play Donald Trump. OK, sure.)</p>
<p>In a way, this is actually quite fitting: each time Comey has surfaced in recent memory, it’s been in a way that’s <a href="https://splinternews.com/the-worst-april-fool-of-all-1833724134">self-promotional</a>, <a href="https://splinternews.com/comey-noooooo-1838418024">deeply unhelpful</a>, or some combination of both. So who better to portray him than the guy who made Will McAvoy one of the <a href="https://splinternews.com/never-forget-how-terrible-the-newsroom-was-1838070325">most pompous, unlikeable TV characters in recent memory</a>? Here’s hoping Aaron Sorkin signs on—then we’ve really got something.</p>
