title: Wall Street Is Legitimately Worried About Warren
---
<p>A few things are true about Elizabeth Warren. She has a long history of expertise in financial regulation; she has a number of unusually detailed <a href="https://elizabethwarren.com/plans/">plans</a> for financial regulation; and, most importantly, she is now polling well enough that Wall Street must seriously contemplate the possibility that she might win. And they’re scared! Here is my favorite bit from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-07/stocks-already-face-pain-of-elizabeth-warren-win-analysts-say">this Bloomberg story</a> quoting multiple financial analysts warning already about Warren’s deleterious effect on upcoming bank earnings reports:</p>
<blockquote> “It’s clear that Warren is uniquely troubling to the finance industry,” Katz wrote, as she “feels comfortable with the subject matter.”</blockquote>
<p>This fuckin lady knows where the bodies are buried! Can we do anything about this???</p>
<p>I absolutely one hundred percent guarantee that Wall Street will become fervently pro-Trump if Warren is the nominee. You will not have seen this many respectable people go Nazi since the, you know, actual Nazis.</p>
<p>Also, Donald Trump will absolutely <a href="https://splinternews.com/who-can-be-blamed-for-the-recession-donald-trump-will-c-1830934656">blame Warren for the recession</a> for which he has been busily laying the groundwork for years now.</p>
