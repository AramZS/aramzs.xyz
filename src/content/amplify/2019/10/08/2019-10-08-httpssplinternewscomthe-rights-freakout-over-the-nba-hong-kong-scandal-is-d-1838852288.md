title: The Right's NBA Hong Kong Freakout Is Dripping With Hypocrisy
---
<p>The main basketball story in the world right now is that Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey <a href="https://deadspin.com/how-much-is-china-worth-to-the-nba-1838843448">tweeted his support</a> of <a href="https://splinternews.com/hong-kong-protests-explode-on-70th-anniversary-of-commu-1838678106">the ongoing protests in Hong Kong</a>, the Chinese government reacted by hitting the NBA right where it hurts—in the wallet—and the NBA reacted to <em>that </em>by folding rather spectacularly.</p>
<p>There are more variables in this story, such as the fact that the Houston Rockets have been one of the most popular teams in China dating back to the early 2000s, when it drafted Chinese sensation Yao Ming No. 1 overall. But at its core, as my colleague Tom Ley <a href="https://deadspin.com/the-nba-is-happy-to-play-chinas-game-1838842840">explained this morning over at Deadspin</a>, that’s what the controversy is: Daryl Morey expressed his free speech, and a bunch of bad faith actors—the NBA and Brooklyn Nets owner and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/joe.tsai.3781/posts/2653378931391524">Taiwanese businessman Joe Tsai included</a>—responded as if he’d taken a dump on 1.4 billion people, rather than a very powerful government that’s trying to suppress civil rights in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>As if this entire thing couldn’t get more embarrassing, however, there’s a burgeoning faction on the American right that’s just itching to make this a cause célèbre for their long-running screed against socialism. And while yes, we know that pointing out hypocrisy on the right is a bit of a futile exercise, it’s pretty funny to watch conservatives openly admit they hold the NBA to a higher standard than themselves or even their president.</p>
<p>Here’s Texas Sen. Ted Cruz:</p>
