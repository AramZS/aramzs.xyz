<h2> Here are some of the best responses: </h2>
<h2> 1. First of all, that safe you bought? Not as safe as you think: </h2>
<blockquote>Any safe that's not bolted down and is small enough for 1-2 people to carry isn't safe at all.</blockquote>

<h2> 2. And that goes for fire safes, too: </h2>
<blockquote>Fire safes only are safe from fires.</blockquote>

<h2> 3. Closets are a known "gold mine": </h2>
<blockquote>Closets — gold mine for jewelry.</blockquote>

<h2> 4. Careful what you put in your medicine cabinets: </h2>
<blockquote>The medicine cabinet or bathroom. I'll just scoop all the drugs out into a bag.</blockquote>

<h2> 5. Don't hide anything in the nightstand: </h2>
<blockquote>We had our apartment burglarized. Guy kicked down the door, and apparently was in and out pretty quickly. <b>I came home from work, and the cop told me, "Never leave valuables in your nightstand." Might have even said bottom drawer.</b> Sure enough, mine were checked, i could tell because my envelopes were moved from where i placed them.</blockquote>

<h2> 6. Be careful what you stash in your foyer: </h2>
<blockquote><b>DON'T USE KEY RACKS OR BOWLS NEXT TO THE DOOR!</b> The amount of stolen cars where the burglar takes one step into the house, picks up the keys to the family car and leaves immediately is just sad.</blockquote>

<h2> 7. Lock your house's windows: </h2>
<blockquote>As a troubled teen, I robbed schools. I can say this: lock your damn windows. 99% of the time we got in with unlocked windows.</blockquote>
<p>—<a data-bonsai-initialized="" data-skimlinks-tracking="5238795" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/dy0yvm/former_burglars_of_reddit_where_is_one_place/f7ybj7k/">RobbStarkNaked</a></p>
<h2> 8. And lock your car doors, unless you want your car stolen: </h2>
<blockquote>You’d be surprised at how often people leave their cars unlocked with nice things inside. <b>A lot of people actually leave them unlocked with the keys inside. It’s how the majority of cars are stolen.</b></blockquote>
<p>—<a data-bonsai-initialized="" data-skimlinks-tracking="5238795" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/dy0yvm/former_burglars_of_reddit_where_is_one_place/f7xusxg/">50nd</a></p>
<h2> 9. Oh, and lock your shed while you're at it, too: </h2>
<blockquote>Your shed. Seriously. LOCK YOUR FUCKING SHED. Even if your house is well-locked, if your shed isn't, I likely have access to a plethora of tools I can use to gain access.</blockquote>
<p>—<a data-bonsai-initialized="" data-skimlinks-tracking="5238795" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/dy0yvm/former_burglars_of_reddit_where_is_one_place/f7y8zgv/">AlphaTangoFoxtrt</a></p>
<h2> 10. But maybe DON'T lock any drawers inside your house: </h2>
<blockquote>Oh, and thanks for locking drawers. That way I know exactly where the valuables are. <b>I can open that cheap wood drawer as quickly with a crowbar as pulling it open.</b></blockquote>

<h2> 11. Just bought a fancy new gadget? Careful what you do with the box, or you might tempt a burglar: </h2>
<blockquote>Don't leave things out that people can see from outside your home or car. <b>If you buy a new TV or computer break down the box it came in.</b> Don't just leave it by your garbage bin.</blockquote>

<h2> 12. And get a little more creative with where you hide your spare key. </h2>
<blockquote>Don’t keep your spare key outside near the front door — under a pot plant, under doormat, top of door frame etc.</blockquote>

<h2> 13. Don't leave anything valuable inside your car: </h2>
<blockquote>Don’t leave stuff in your car. When I was in high school, we did our fair share of carhopping.</blockquote>

<h2> 14. ...Including your college textbooks: </h2>
<blockquote>For the college kids that might read this, don't keep your textbooks in your car. On the day of my finals I had about six textbooks I was gonna sell in my car. Came back to find someone broke my window and stole the textbooks. <b>Cop told me that it's very common and unlikely they will catch the guy, so I was out ~$700,</b> which was huge as a college student.</blockquote>

<h2> 15. Keep some lights on when you go on vacation: </h2>
<blockquote>LED lighting is cheap these days. <b>If your house is gonna be vacant for a while, consider investing in one of those smart-lighting systems</b> where you can set different rooms to turn on and off at different points in the day. (Kitchen during dinnertime, bedrooms at night, etc.)</blockquote>

<h2> 16. Hide things in places robbers wouldn't want to touch: </h2>
<blockquote>Had my house burglarized by a so-called friend. He missed by far the most valuable thing. it’s just a safe sitting on the laundry room floor. <b>He missed it because I’m a scumbag and had it covered with a mountain of dirty clothes and towels.</b> So not being tidy saved me upwards of $35K.</blockquote>

<h2> 17. Decoys can work wonders: </h2>
<blockquote>My cousin lives in a bad neighborhood, so she went to a thrift store, bought an obvious-looking jewelry box and a bunch of expensive looking costume jewelry that’s actually worthless and put it in the box. She keeps this in a conspicuous place. Then she leaves a few 20s on top. <b>This way if someone breaks in, they will grab this and run, ignoring some of her well-hidden valuables.</b></blockquote>

<h2> 18. You might have to get REAL inventive with the hiding spots, TBH: </h2>
<blockquote>I've seen people make false outlets for hiding valuables like cash and jewelry. Just an idea, a burglar would have to be at your home for a long time to start checking outlets.</blockquote>
<p>—<a data-bonsai-initialized="" data-skimlinks-tracking="5238795" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/dy0yvm/former_burglars_of_reddit_where_is_one_place/f7ya9m4/">ban_me_daddyy</a></p>
<h2> 19. And finally, there was this former burglar, who summed things up pretty well: </h2>
<blockquote>I'm going to look under your bed, I'm going to dump out any drawer I find. I'm checking your freezer. I'm looking under the bathroom cabinet. Think that incredibly smart hiding spot you saw in a spy movie will work? We watch spy movies too. It's really going to be a matter of security versus convenience for you. <b>If it takes me more than a minute to get to something (and don't forget I'm more than willing to break shit to get to stuff) then it's not worth my trouble. I want to be out of your house in less than 15 minutes tops.</b></blockquote>
