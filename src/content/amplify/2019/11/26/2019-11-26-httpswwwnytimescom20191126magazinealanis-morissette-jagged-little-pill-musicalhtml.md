<p>The Alanis Morissette song “Hand in My Pocket” is a list of opposites that aren’t really opposites at all, when you really think about it. “I’m short but I’m healthy,” she sings, in the half-yodel, half-dove-coo that people still channel in late-night karaoke bars. “I’m sick but I’m pretty, babyyyy.” Being petite has no bearing on a person’s hardiness, but of course, that isn’t the point. Morissette wrote the song — which became the fourth track on “Jagged Little Pill,” an album so popular at its height that it sold nearly half a million copies in one week — in less than an hour when she was 20. The lyrics are more affective than logical, more moody than meticulous. Morissette was showing that young people contain multitudes and that they are eager to describe — to themselves, to some distant, judgmental grown-up — their contradictory inner lives.</p>
<p>Listening to the song 25 years later, as I did over and over one morning in May while waiting to meet Morissette at a resort an hour south of Los Angeles, was comforting, like an oversize, beloved cardigan that has grown a bit baggy in the sleeves. Still, taken as a whole, the album has undeniable power: It’s urgent and raw.</p>
<p>It may be difficult to comprehend now, in the fractured world of streaming and microfandom, but “Jagged Little Pill” was once one of the biggest albums in the world. In 1996, the record sold more than 10 million copies; it has sold another 20 million since, according to Entertainment Weekly. To put it another way, this one album, written by a former teenage pop star from Canada, has sold as many copies as Taylor Swift’s entire discography combined. Morissette’s lyrics are funny and rebellious (it’s still electrifying to mouth the words “Would she go down on you in a theater?” from “You Oughta Know”), but they came packaged in high-gloss, catchy, grand ballads. She wasn’t just angry at an ex-boyfriend; she was slicing herself open with rage, interrupting his dinner to howl “you told me you’d hold me until you died, and you’re still alive.”</p>

<p>Most of the songs on “Jagged Little Pill” began as a transcription of Morissette’s interior monologue while she was living alone in Los Angeles, spending a lot of time rollerblading on the Santa Monica pier. She had moved there from Ontario, where as a child she became first a television star and then <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/14/arts/the-pop-life-alanis-morissette-reveals-her-trials-as-a-teenage-star.html">a pop sensation</a>. She began searching for collaborators, finally settling on the producer Glen Ballard, who had worked with Michael Jackson and Wilson Phillips. (“Ironic” was the only song whose lyrics they wrote together; the rest came directly from Morissette’s diary.) After a year, she and Ballard had a demo of unpolished, one-take recordings that they’d made late at night in Ballard’s studio. What happened next is the stuff of rock legend — a dozen labels rejected the demos, but then Guy Oseary, a 23-year-old A.&amp;R. executive at Maverick (which was then Madonna’s label), heard “You Oughta Know,” “Perfect” and “Hand in My Pocket” and signed Morissette on the spot. A majority of the vocals on the album were drawn from the original tapes.</p>
<p>Within six months of its release, it seemed as if “Jagged Little Pill” was playing on every radio station, all the time. The video for “Ironic,” in which Morissette portrayed four different versions of herself (wild, childlike, whimsical and determined) in four different outfits belting in a station wagon, ran on MTV several times a day. Both her voice and her look — long brown tendrils parted down the middle, blousy satin shirts or flannels and tight leather pants — were unmistakable and inescapable, widely imitated by her fans and parodied by “Mad TV.” She was the musical guest on “Saturday Night Live.” Rolling Stone put her on its cover with the headline “Angry White Female.” She was nowhere, and then she was everywhere.</p>
<p>Morissette won four Grammys in 1996; Radiohead opened for <em>her</em> on tour. At the same time, she was subjected to withering condescension by both critics and other female musicians, who either labeled her an unhinged “banshee” or a varnished sellout. Her emphatic tone and lilting urgency are still sometimes viewed with a kind of knee-jerk disdain (recently Jezebel ran <a href="https://themuse.jezebel.com/jagged-little-pill-is-actually-very-bad-1833542975">a viral post</a> titled “Jagged Little Pill Is Actually Very Bad???” in which a writer argued that the album’s lyrics were jejune and best relegated to the dustbin of her youth; hundreds of commenters pushed back). But as I walked around the resort — where women were drinking chardonnay in the shade of giant succulents before noon — I wondered if the critics of “Jagged Little Pill” over the years have simply failed to understand the quality that made it a staple of road trips and impromptu group singalongs. The fact that it makes you feel perpetually 16 is not a drawback but rather its core appeal. All the tracks on the record, even the schmaltzy ones about falling in love, are tender and peeling at the surface like a sunburn.</p>
<p>As “You Oughta Know” began to play in my earbuds and Morissette warbled that first, shaky “I,” I immediately felt a rush of dopamine to my brain. In its piercing tone and operatic overstatement, “Jagged Little Pill” remains a wonderfully transparent document of a young woman’s emotions, of her passion, of her capacity for catharsis. If her tone was singular then, it isn’t anymore. We live in a moment when women are fed up, openly, much of the time. Morissette’s register no longer sounds histrionic — it’s descriptive of a mood many of us recognize. And now the album will be ushered back into the mainstream by way of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/12/theater/you-oughta-know-jagged-little-pill.html">a new Broadway musical</a> (written by the screenwriter Diablo Cody and directed by Diane Paulus, who won <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/26/theater/reviews/pippin-directed-by-diane-paulus-at-the-music-box-theater.html">a Tony for “Pippin”</a>), which will open on Dec. 5.</p>
<p>When Morissette arrived in the resort’s “California coastal” restaurant, she was glowing and six months pregnant, wearing a fluttery white eyelet top, a pair of maternity jeans and sensible suede Newbark loafers. Though she was 45 and about to be a mother of three, there was something discordant about seeing a person who is practically synonymous with adolescent angst in this place, with its bungalows and golf carts and saltwater pools and the general vibe of a rehab facility for exhausted celebrities. Morissette explained that she was here to decompress after a recent move to Northern California. She had brought along her two young children, Onyx and Ever, and her husband, the rapper Souleye. She was finally done with living in Los Angeles, ready to be closer to her best friends, to Big Sur, to the redwoods, to skiing at Lake Tahoe. More people “un-school” their kids up north, she said. She was mentally preparing for a busy summer and fall. There was the baby, of course, and a new album — her first in eight years — would be coming out in the spring of 2020, right after “Jagged Little Pill,” the musical, whose development Morissette was intimately involved with.</p>

<p>Glancing around the restaurant’s stuffy private dining room, which was dark and furnished like a sleek airport lounge, Morissette kept one hand on her belly, while the other one gestured gently to her publicist. She asked if I wouldn’t mind moving somewhere sunnier, maybe up to a suite, where we could order room service. The way she said this wasn’t divaesque, just matter of fact. Some rooms are inspiring; others are not. In the elevator on the way to our new location, Morissette asked me, in a soothing voice, if I had also felt a bad energy in the room. When I nodded, her eyes lit up. “So you’re also an H.S.P.,” she said. “A highly sensitive person.” Morissette has a calming, patient aura, like a therapist you’ve been seeing for years. She smiles widely and often, and you feel compelled to offer up confidences large and small: issues you’ve been working through with your mother, or how you’ve been off dairy lately. Her team refers to her in their communications by the unicorn emoji, and this feels apt: She has a fanciful, almost girlish lightness to her.</p>
<p>[<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/30/theater/review-jagged-little-pill-musical.html">Read our review of an earlier production of “Jagged Little Pill,” the musical</a>.]</p>
<p>Upstairs, as we sat across from each other on opposing plush love seats with a floor-to-ceiling window beaming sunlight into our faces, Morissette told me that over the years, several producers had come to her with proposals to adapt “Jagged Little Pill” for the stage. But they always wanted to make a show about her life. “I have no desire to do a jukebox musical,” she said.</p>
<p>Then Cody came to her with the idea that the songs from “Jagged Little Pill” could be used to chart the story of a contemporary family. After several workshops (which also included Paulus), the musical they created now touches on almost every climactic issue of 2019: opioid addiction, a queer woman whose mother won’t accept her, a white family butting heads with an adopted black daughter, a sexual assault and an ensuing #MeToo battle. It’s a lot to pack into one musical, but too-muchness is Morissette’s way. Though some people involved with the show had doubts about putting a high school rape onstage, Morissette believed the show could take on delicate issues like abuse and consent. “I’m not naming any names, but some people were really concerned, like ‘How are we going to back this up? This is a really huge subject,’ ” she said. “I said: ‘It’s me. How could I not back it up? I’m here.’ ” She assured the doubters that because this plotline came from her life, she would work with Cody and Paulus to make it sensitive and substantial. Morissette was actively participating in the creation of the show; during its initial run in Boston, she sat in the audience most nights, scribbling notes about how to deepen the relationships between the characters.</p>
<p>I asked her how she even made it through the ’90s, when she was so exposed and often ridiculed for her candor. Morissette stared directly into my eyes. “Some part of me goes: I wasn’t dead because I’m Canadian, and because I’m therapy-minded, and because I will lose my [expletive] and sob for three hours in my hotel room and then feel somehow cleansed after that.”</p>
<p>Then she got up to pace the room. Another explanation occurred to her. She clenched her jaw. “And it’s because I’m angry enough to survive. You know?”</p>
<p><strong>“Jagged Little Pill,” </strong>the musical, it should be said, is not a very angry show. Cody, the Oscar-winning screenwriter of the caustic teenage-pregnancy comedy “Juno,” who wrote the book, felt that it was important to balance the album’s darkness with moments of whimsy. “Not the Doctor,” for example, now takes place in the context of a couple’s therapy session gone wrong. “Ironic” is set in a high school writing workshop: One character reads her poetry about “rain on your wedding day” to the class, and her peers pick her apart for the malapropism. To take Morissette’s oeuvre seriously, as Cody does, involves believing that she was always in on the joke — and that because she can laugh at herself, the moments when she breaks down feel more earned.</p>
<p>Cody told me recently that working on the libretto for “Jagged Little Pill” made her fall in love with writing again. She had been going through a rough patch with screenwriting, feeling pushed to produce commercial pablum. “I come from garbage land, where everything exists to sell a toy,” she told me. We were sitting upstairs, on a summer afternoon, at the French restaurant Tout Va Bien in Midtown Manhattan. Cody has short black hair and was wearing a rockabilly-style vintage dress. She was in New York, with Paulus, to present a few numbers from “Jagged Little Pill” to the press. “Being able to work on something where people are talking about trauma and psychoanalytic concepts was very refreshing.”</p>

<p>What Cody liked most was the opportunity to put new ideas into the show in real time, in much the same rapid-fire way that Morissette originally wrote the lyrics for the album. After the 2018 mass shooting at a high school in Parkland, Fla., for instance, she wrote in a two-second reference about gun violence. “It’s not a show about gun control, and yet that moment is still in the show,” she said. “Because we just thought, This is something else that is [expletive] up.”</p>
<p>Cody connected to “Jagged Little Pill,” the album, almost in spite of herself. She was a fan of riot grrrl music growing up (“I liked the kind of bands that would pull their tampon out and throw it at the audience”) but said that she was instantly drawn to the theatricality of Morissette’s words. “I can actually tell you the very first time I heard it,” she told me. “I specifically remember being in my bedroom, in the suburbs of Chicago.” She was 16 and tuned into Q101. “I remember the D.J. saying, ‘Wow, I am really excited to play this song.’ ”</p>
<p>Cody said she always considered “Jagged Little Pill” to be a “concept album,” with a latent narrative stringing the songs together. It is one of the reasons, she said, that after three years of developing the musical, she is “still not sick of those songs.” From a plot perspective, Cody saw Morissette’s charge to update the album for 2019 as a call to maximalism; the show, she felt, should try to grapple with as many pressing cultural issues as it could in order to mirror Morissette’s own unbridledness. The first character Cody invented, a Connecticut housewife named Mary Jane Healy (played by Elizabeth Stanley), is a stressed-out mother who has become addicted to opioids after a car accident, an incident that triggers her memories of a college sexual assault. She won’t admit her dependency to her family — her husband, whom she no longer sleeps with; her Harvard-bound perfectionist son; her adopted queer black daughter — and she becomes increasingly isolated.</p>
<p>“All I Really Want” is now sung by the whole Healy family at breakfast, as they talk past one another. Frankie, the Healys’ daughter (Celia Rose Gooding), sings: “Do I stress you out? My sweater is on backwards and inside out” as a provocation to her nit-picking mom. Throughout the song, she goads her mother while she makes activist posters to take to school, and then the number swells into a throng of students at a protest holding signs about reproductive rights and gender equality. On the original record, Morissette stops singing for a second in the middle of the song to make a point about how people fill silences with their own anxieties. “Here, can you handle this?” she sings. In the musical, the moment becomes the occasion for the Parkland reference: As Frankie sings these words, she holds up a sign that says “How Many More?” as an image of high school students participating in a lie-in protest is projected behind her.</p>
<p>It’s not exactly understated, but neither is “Jagged Little Pill.” These issues demand in-your-face confrontation, the show seems to say. It’s an argument for abandoning nuance out of necessity. Paulus told me that the show started to come together for her when she realized it was less about razzle-dazzle and more about working through complicated questions in the form of song and dance. This may be why so much of the choreography, from Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui, is jerky and tortured, as if the dancers are trying to crawl out of their own skins. They are mimicking Morissette’s movements when she first sang the album, those shimmying contortions that made her look as if she was actively sloughing off her demons.</p>
<p><strong>“Jagged Little Pill,” </strong>the album, reflects real loneliness and trauma. Morissette wanted me to know this, perhaps because at the time she was derided as a packaged studio creation, someone merely pantomiming a gritty persona. The songs in which she’s seething, she explained, were entirely authentic.</p>
<figure><p class="rw-outer-content"><span>Some content could not be imported from the original document.</span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/uri/embeddedinteractive/4dcc462d-bfb0-5fd7-aba1-3d8151a4263c?">View content ↗ </a></p></figure>
<p>When she was just 14, Morissette signed with MCA Records after she starred in the children’s television show “You Can’t Do That on Television.” The label promoted her as Canada’s answer to Debbie Gibson and Tiffany, but behind the scenes, she was experiencing depression and anxiety and felt older men were taking advantage of her. “I mean, I was flying alone when I was 10,” she told me. “I was going on a music-video shoot with four men to Europe when I was 14. I was always the one that everyone was like, ‘She’s going to be fine.’ Meanwhile, I’m like chewing my nails down to the quick and throwing up and having sexual-abuse stories all through my teens.”</p>
<p>Though she worked with Ballard to craft her melodies, “Jagged Little Pill” was lyrically and vocally her own. “I mean, I was just writing about what I was thinking about and mulling over and ruminating, what I was tortured by or yearning for at the time,” she said.</p>
<p>“Jagged Little Pill” most likely could not have existed outside its exact musical moment, cresting to popularity just after grunge tipped into the mainstream. Its crispy production borrowed from what was happening in Seattle (and fused that sound with sticky pop licks), but Morissette was far less punk-oriented in her ethos than either Courtney Love or riot grrrl bands like Bikini Kill, L7 and Bratmobile. Her success seemed to highlight the subtle difference between dirtiness and messiness in female performance. While Kathleen Hanna performed in ripped clothes and sold fanzines denouncing the “white male patriarchy,” Morissette performed in arenas and turned her anger into anthemic choruses — her messaging was accessible, easy to hum along with.</p>
<p>For the female musicians who actively resisted being swept up by the industry, which was (and still is) mostly run by men, accessibility was a kind of betrayal (see Fiona Apple’s declaring “this world is [expletive]” from the stage of the MTV Video Music Awards, or Ani DiFranco’s refusing to sign to a record label she did not own). The riot grrrl ethos was “girls to the front” — a communal taking up space — while Morissette’s was more like “girls to your car,” where you could process your baggage in private. One was like being at a protest, and the other is like being in therapy — different impulses, but both about making conscious changes.</p>
<p>Morissette’s music clicked quickly with the public: She was selling millions of records, touring the country and finding at shows that her fans had invented dance moves to go with “Hand in My Pocket.” But as soon as the album started climbing the charts, it was met with derision from some critics; even praise could be backhanded. When Rolling Stone listed “Jagged Little Pill” as one of the 100 best albums of the ’90s, it wrote, “Proof that the gods of rock are unfair bastards: A former TV moppet from the not-so-dirty North hooks up with Wilson Phillips’ producer and makes an opportunistic angst-rock platter that not only sells 13 million copies — it <em>doesn’t suck</em>.”</p>
<p>Beyond snippy journalists, Morissette found she had an even harder time being accepted by her peers, despite the fact that several popular female musicians at the time were banding together for events like Lilith Fair. At the height of her fame, Morissette tried calling other successful artists on the phone to ask for advice, but she said she couldn’t break through. Even the women who came before her seemed to turn their noses up at her sudden rise. When Joni Mitchell was asked by Details magazine in 1996 to comment on the state of contemporary music, she responded, “It’s appallingly sick, for the most part,” and went onto disparage Morissette: “Alanis Morissette writes words, someone else helps set it to music and then she’s kind of stylized into the part.”</p>
<p>Looking back on that time, Morissette told me: There were a lot of women “who were not sisterly or kind. Then over time, way less publicly, they would apologize, or they would take responsibility, or they would say, ‘I’m so sorry I said that.’ ” She continued, “I, naïvely, thought that fame was going to create this sense of connection ... and the opposite wound up being true.”</p>
<p>Morissette may never have been outwardly political enough to bond with the riot grrrls — and her peers had legitimate reason to complain that their rebellion was being diluted by pop radio writ large — but she wasn’t necessarily trying to attract the kinds of fans who already bought zines and wore “Do My Nipples Offend You?” T-shirts. “Jagged Little Pill” functioned more like an invitation, allowing young women (and their fathers, and their mothers, and their second cousins) to tap into their rage in a way that they maybe would not have done without seeing her on MTV. The academic Sara Marcus, who wrote a book on the history of the riot grrrl movement, told the writer Allison Yarrow, the author of “90s Bitch,” that she may have been too quick to judge Morissette back in the day. “Some women aren’t aware of Hole, but they’re listening to Alanis Morissette,” she said. “Now we’re at a third-generation degraded copy, and at the same time, there’s an embrace of anger and obscenity that does something for people.”</p>
<p>The culture Morissette came into was one in which female artists were regularly abused, and then sidelined, by male executives. Other women who came up during that time, like Liz Phair and Tori Amos, are now writing their memoirs and detailing how they were dismissed and objectified; in her recent “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/09/books/review/horror-stories-liz-phair.html">Horror Stories</a>,” Phair writes about being stalked, screamed at and groped in the studio by her older male collaborators (her music was deeply informed, she writes, by “the treacherous waters of the male appetite”). If Morissette lacked subtlety in her lamentations about the abuse she suffered or the love she felt she deserved, it was because she wanted to be explicit. When she sang “You took me for a joke, you took me for a child, you took a long hard look at my ass, and then played golf for a while,” her message was impossible to ignore.</p>
<p>Rhetorically, pop music has caught up with Morissette. So many hit songs now feature women excavating difficult moments from their lives and putting them on display: Kesha’s “Praying,” Robyn’s “Dancing on My Own,” Demi Lovato’s “Sober,” Lana del Rey’s “Summertime Sadness,” Adele’s “Hello,” Billie Eilish’s “Xanny,” the entirety of the Beyoncé album “Lemonade.” These artists might not cite Morissette as a direct influence, but “Jagged Little Pill” opened up a space in popular music for women to be performatively overwrought, and out of that surplus to find a searing lucidity. Morissette remains, to this day, one of the only artists who seem to invite singing like her when her songs are on: It is hard to hear “Hand in My Pocket” and not want to affect her singular and strange, almost Alpine voice. You <em>become</em> Morissette because what she is saying is less of a verbal transmission and more of a whole-body release. She gave voice to her own humiliation and abasement, and in re-enacting that, you may feel a bit humiliated yourself, like a teenager slamming a bedroom door. But it also feels generative. We’re all pissed as hell. Why be coy about it?</p>

<p><strong>The climax of </strong>“Jagged Little Pill,” the musical, happens during the second act, when a character named Jo (the phenomenal Lauren Patten), a queer high school student in a floppy beanie and a butch track jacket, sings “You Oughta Know” to the girl who left her to make out with a Harry Styles look-alike in her English class. Patten’s interpretation of the song is a slow burn; it starts as a whisper and ends as a wail. By the last chorus, she is teetering on the edge of the stage, practically vomiting up her words, beating at her chest in a pool of tomato-red light.</p>
<p>Every time Patten performs “You Oughta Know” in the musical’s previews, she stops the show. This is not a euphemism; people get out of their seats at this exact moment. At first, Paulus and Cody were surprised by the interruption and tried to contain it with lighting cues. But people kept standing up. They’ve now built the applause into the run time.</p>
<p>At the matinee I attended in November, the woman next to me sprang up before the song was even over, hollering through cupped hands as if she were at a hippodrome. I was so swept up in her enthusiasm that I, too, began to scream. There is something inherently dopey about a standing ovation in the theater — all that wriggling out of tiny velvet seats, all that collective emotion unleashed — but this one felt so eager and automatic that it transcended cheesiness. We were all cheering for Patten, who had wrung out her guts onstage, and we were cheering for Morissette, who created a song we have been humming for much of our lives. But also, I thought, as I glanced around the audience, many of us were also clapping for our younger selves, when we first blasted “Jagged Little Pill” in our bedrooms. As we sat down again, I thought I could hear a sigh of tenderness pass through the room, for the people that we used to be.</p>
