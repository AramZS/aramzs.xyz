<p><a data-vars-event-id="c6" data-vars-item-name="BL-8985646-/topic/rami-malek" href="https://www.the-independent.com/topic/rami-malek">Rami Malek</a> has revealed that he insisted upon just one thing prior to accepting his role as the villain in <em><a data-vars-event-id="c6" data-vars-item-name="BL-8985646-/topic/bond-25" href="https://www.the-independent.com/topic/bond-25">Bond 25</a>:</em> that his character wouldn’t be an Arabic-speaking terrorist, or a villain who uses religion as justification for his crimes.</p>
<p>“It’s a great character and I’m very excited,” Malek told <a data-vars-event-id="c6" data-vars-item-name="BL-8985646-https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/james-bond-villain-rami-malek-17370688" href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/james-bond-villain-rami-malek-17370688"><em>The Mirror</em></a>. “But that was one thing that I discussed with [director] <a data-vars-event-id="c6" data-vars-item-name="BL-8985646-/topic/cary-fukunaga" href="https://www.the-independent.com/topic/cary-fukunaga">Cary Fukunaga</a>. I said, ‘We cannot identify him with any act of terrorism reflecting an ideology or a religion. That’s not something I would entertain, so if that is why I am your choice then you can count me out’. But that was clearly not his vision. So he’s a very different kind of terrorist.”</p>
<p>The <em><a data-vars-event-id="c6" data-vars-item-name="BL-8985646-/topic/bohemian-rhapsody" href="https://www.the-independent.com/topic/bohemian-rhapsody">Bohemian Rhapsody</a></em> Oscar winner said that his own ethnic background, and his awareness of the importance of positive representation, drove him to the decision.</p>
<p>Speaking of his Egyptian heritage as “the fabric of who I am”, Malek added: “I am Egyptian. I grew up listening to Egyptian music. I loved Omar Sharif. These are my people. I feel so gorgeously tied to the culture and the human beings that exist there.”</p>
<p>As for <em>Bond 25</em>, Malek teased that it is “another extremely clever script from the people who have figured out exactly what people want in those movies. But I feel a substantial weight on my shoulders. I mean, Bond is something that we all grow up with.”</p>
