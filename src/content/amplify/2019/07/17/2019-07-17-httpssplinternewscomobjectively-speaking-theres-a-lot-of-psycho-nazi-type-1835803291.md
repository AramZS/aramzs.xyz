  Objectively Speaking, There's a Lot of Psycho Nazi Type Stuff in This Laura
  Ingraham Background Report
---
<p>Axios has <a href="https://www.axios.com/leaked-donald-trump-vetting-docs-hbo-6ce3cd26-1eb9-4da8-b15e-47b56020aef7.html">published a collection </a>of leaked Trump administration vetting reports—the background documents that Trump’s team prepared on its potential hires and appointees. For example, Fox News’ Laura Ingraham <a href="https://graphics.axios.com/docs/white-house-vetting-docs/Laura%20Ingraham%20Backgrounder.pdf">was vetted</a> for the role of White House Press Secretary. Has she ever said anything… <em>problematic</em>?</p>
<p>Seems normal.</p>
<p>There is another entire <a href="https://graphics.axios.com/docs/white-house-vetting-docs/Laura%20Ingraham%20Backgrounder.pdf">section</a> entitled “Red Flags,” besides this.</p>
<p>Good candidate!</p>
