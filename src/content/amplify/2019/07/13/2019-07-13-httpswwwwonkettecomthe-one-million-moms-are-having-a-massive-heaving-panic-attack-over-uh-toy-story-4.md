<p>The One Million Moms are being completely reasonable again, asking parents and other concerned citizens to sign a petition to tell Disney that they are mad about a "dangerous" and "controversial" scene they were "blindsided" by in the new <em>Toy Story</em> movie.</p>
<p>And how, exactly, is <em>Toy Story 4</em> assaulting the virgin eyes of their young, impressionable children? WITH LESBIAN PORNOGRAPHY. And they will not stand for it!</p>
<blockquote><p>To Disney from One Million Moms: <br/><br/>I do not appreciate Disney including LGBTQ content in the children's movie Toy Story 4. There has been a deliberate lack of mentioning this content. Therefore, families are blindsided intentionally by your company. Actions such as this make me continue to distrust Disney.</p></blockquote>
<p>Wait, no, not lesbian pornography. Lesbian moms. Two one-second scenes of lesbian moms dropping their kid off at school and then subsequently picking them up. So easy to get those two things confused!</p>
<blockquote><p>One Million Moms wants to ban Toy Story 4 for this 1 second background image of 2 women picking up a child from sch… https: //t.co/F4sNuXhzEv</p><p>— M∆TT PÜNK (@M∆TT PÜNK) <a href="https://twitter.com/MattPunkArt/status/1148663629035626496">1562697724.0</a></p></blockquote>
<p>But then they have hot, steamy, sexy sex (probably scissoring) right there in front of all the school children????</p>
<p>No. They just give their kid a hug, and then ostensibly return to their cartoon home and eat some cartoon snacks, or maybe they run some cartoon errands or take their kid to a cartoon piano class. We don't know, because they are background characters that are only in the movie for a couple seconds.</p>
<p>And that, <a href="https://onemillionmoms.com/current-campaigns/disney-blindsides-families-with-lesbian-scene-in-toy-story-4/">according to the One Million Moms</a> , is <em>exactly</em> the problem.</p>
<blockquote><p>At the start of the movie, when Woody's new owner Bonnie goes for her first day of kindergarten, in the background there is a quick scene where one child is dropped off by two moms. Later, the moms return to pick up their child who gives them a hug. The scene is subtle in order to to desensitize children. But it is obvious that the child has two mothers, and they are parenting together. <em>Toy Story 4</em> is the last place parents would expect their children to be confronted with content regarding sexual orientation. Issues of this nature are being introduced too early and too soon. It is extremely common yet unnecessary.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ah yes. Who knows what could happen if their children watch this movie! They might not scream in horror when they encounter a non-cartoon gay person! They might <em>not</em> be the weird kid in school who doesn't know that gay people exist in the year 2019!</p>
<p>The fact that the scene was so short, apparently, resulted in it not even being reported in the mainstream media as a national emergency, making it look as if everyone was just totally fine with some moms picking their kid up from school:</p>
<blockquote><p>Some in the gay blogging community have agreed that the moment "was not groundbreaking by any standard" but continued to praise it as a "small moment of normalization," which is exactly why 1MM finds this to be so dangerous. It has not been mentioned much in mainstream media, which could appear as acceptance when really it was because it happened so fast. But the scene was included and intentionally not announced prior to the movie release in hopes it would be kept quiet to expose as many children as possible.</p></blockquote>
<p>Just like a subway flasher!</p>
<p>In addition to the <em>Toy Story 4</em> petition, One Million Moms is also currently hosting petitions to tell Teen Vogue to stop telling teenagers that abortion exists, yell at Procter &amp; Gamble for a commercial wherein a young girl uses dandruff shampoo and then goes to prom with another girl, and to yell at Kroger for getting a perfect score on the Human Rights Campaign's <a href="https://assets2.hrc.org/files/assets/resources/CEI-2019-FullReport.pdf">2019 Corporate Equality Index</a> by sponsoring gay pride parades, and running ads during NBC's <em>Good Girls</em> , probably because they are mad about how awesome Retta is.</p>
<p>It may shock you to know that One Million Moms is not actually an organization of one million moms who are just really concerned that their children might find out that gay people exist. In fact, it is not an organization at all. Rather it is an "online project" run by the American Family Association, an SPLC designated hate group. All they do is put up petitions on their site that, as far as we know, may never even actually be signed by anyone.</p>
