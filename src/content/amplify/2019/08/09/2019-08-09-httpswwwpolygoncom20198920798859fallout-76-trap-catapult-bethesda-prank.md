<p>Picture this: You’re minding your own business, out in the wasteland of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/fallout-76/40362"><em>Fallout 76</em></a>, when you come across a camp with a store. Hey, you might think, maybe this is a good time to restock my inventory.</p>
<p>Oh, you sweet summer child. You know not what horrors await you.</p>

<p>A large part of the fun in <em>Fallout 76</em> comes from encountering other players, but their presence in your game doesn’t always bring good tidings. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGy7SC_38rEG9hRA9OxMPSA">Xntryk 1</a>, for example, is a fiend who has set up an elaborate trap in his camp. He tricks people into standing in front of his store, only to push a button that releases the trap door. His prey then falls into pit full of flamethrowers and spikes. Most players are killed instantly.</p>
<p>But that isn’t cool thing here; plenty of people have built fire traps before. After your lifeless body falls to the ground, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGy7SC_38rEG9hRA9OxMPSA">Xntryk 1</a> pours salt into the wound by catapulting your corpse into the air. His victims are sent flying to god knows where, as the camp seems to be situated atop a huge cliff. It’s the funniest thing I’ve seen all week.</p>
<p>But hey, don’t feel too bad for these folks. They’re probably going to remember this and laugh about it, at some point.</p>
<p>Apparently, “sending unsuspecting people flying” has become a <em>thing </em>in <em>Fallout 76</em>, as evidenced by this other clip by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUjGas399bk7cDso33C9uuA">Jibwizard</a>.</p>
<p>Basically, if you come across a player camp or store, look around and make sure you’re not about to walk into a trap. Or maybe just enjoy the ride?</p>
