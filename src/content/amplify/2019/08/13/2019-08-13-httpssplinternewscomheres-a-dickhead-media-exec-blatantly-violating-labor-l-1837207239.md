title: Here's a Dickhead Media Exec Blatantly Violating Labor Law
---
<p>That charming tweet came after Portnoy taunted the staff of The Ringer, where sports man Bill Simmons is CEO, <a href="https://deadspin.com/what-does-bill-simmons-think-of-the-ringer-union-1837176138">for announcing they’d unionized</a> with the Writers Guild of America, East. (G/O Media’s editorial teams are also unionized with the WGAE.)</p>
<p>Hey, remember what happened to Gawker? Ha? That’s the joke, I guess! If you want even the bare minimum by way of workplace protections, a malevolent billionaire <a href="https://gawker.com/gawker-was-murdered-by-gaslight-1785456581">WILL come and sue you out of existence</a> for publishing something he doesn’t like.</p>
<p>Of course, Portnoy kept going, bragging about how he actually hopes Barstool unionizes, he’d actually be laughing, no, seriously, because then he could “crush” it:</p>
<p>All very, very cool stuff from a very cool dude! But then things actually got funny: My guy caused such a fuss that some heavy hitters in labor got involved:</p>
<p>This was like a drug dealer bragging to the cops about a big score—just the dumbest shit imaginable. Try to put yourself in the shoes of a man so self-involved that he can’t help but peacock about his plans to break the law. One for the ages!</p>
<p>Here’s hoping any organizing effort at Barstool—yes, we want everyone, even our notional enemies, to organize—is free from interference by dickhead managers, and that workers get the recognition and a seat at a table they deserve, and then, I don’t know, <a href="https://splinternews.com/fuck-bosses-long-live-unions-1830767630">figure out what to do with Portnoy</a>. In the meantime, I feel confident saying that basically anyone at G/O Media (myself included!) would be happy to talk to any Barstool staffers about why we love our union and how to get started building your own today.</p>
