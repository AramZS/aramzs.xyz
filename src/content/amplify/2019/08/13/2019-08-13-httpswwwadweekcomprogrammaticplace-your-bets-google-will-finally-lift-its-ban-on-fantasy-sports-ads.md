<p><a href="https://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/google-rolls-out-5-new-features-and-tools-to-make-commerce-easier/">Google</a> is preparing to lift its longstanding ban on advertisements for fantasy sports services, Adweek has learned. The change—which will be rolling out in select states by the end of this month—will allow media buyers to advertise across Google Ads and DV360, offering media buyers access to the booming, high-intent audiences across Google Search, YouTube and more.</p>
<p>“Advertisers will need to meet minimum creative requirements and must hold state licenses where required to promote their products in targeted states,” Google noted <a href="https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/9395358?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=29265">in a policy update explaining the change.</a> “If advertisers operate in a state where no license is required, they must hold a state license in at least one other state.”</p>
