<p>It’s by now a truism that <strong>Donald Trump</strong> drags everyone and everything down to his level—and for no institution (well, except maybe the Republican Party) is this truer than for the <em>New York Times.</em> Early last week, a disastrous headline—“TRUMP URGES UNITY VS. RACISM”—was quickly amended in print after the following day’s first edition went to press. The new headline, “ASSAILING HATE BUT NOT GUNS,” was seen as an improvement, but not a big enough one, and it didn’t stop a hydrogen bomb’s worth of angry criticism on social media, accompanied by a wave of threatened and, in some cases, actual canceled subscriptions. “People think the leadership of the <em>New York Times</em> sat down and tried to come up with a headline that mollified Donald Trump and that’s just not the case,” executive editor <strong>Dean Baquet</strong> <a href="https://www.cjr.org/public_editor/nyt-headline-trump-mass-shootings.php">told <em>CJR</em></a>. He attributed the radioactive headline to a combination of space constraints and deadline pressures that the team responsible for laying out the front page was up against, a rationale that lays bare the extent to which even the most valuable print real estate on earth has been de-prioritized in the digital age. “The print hub is not right in the middle of the news desk anymore. I don’t lay out the page. I don’t pick the front-page stories. I don’t think that’s the role of the executive editor anymore,” Baquet said in his <em>CJR</em> interview, with a caveat: “It’s important for me to say, if anyone is at fault, the executive editor is at fault.”</p>
<p>The crisis recalled several others involving the paper’s sometimes problematic and imperfectly applied impulse toward both-sides-ism, and the left’s problems with this approach. As much as the <em>Times</em>’s “but-her-emails” campaign coverage is still widely seen as a dark stain on the paper’s reputation, the “unity” headline seemed especially obtuse and unconnected to the world the <em>Times</em> was supposedly observing.</p>
<p>By Sunday night, to no one’s surprise, Team Trump had weaponized the now infamous headline in its ongoing war against the so-called “Biased New York Times,” which was the subject line of an email sent from Trump’s 2020 campaign to supporters: “Did you see the latest New York Times headline? Probably not considering they changed it after the Whiny Liberal Mob cried enough to get it changed.... Take our Official New York Times Accountability Survey before 11:59 PM to make sure they see YOUR answers.” (Sample questions: “Do you believe the New York Times is biased?”; “Do you believe the New York Times fails to report factually?”; “Would you sign a petition that demands the New York Times is no longer recognized as a real newspaper?”)</p>
<p>Last Thursday, more shit hit the <em>Times</em> fan, apparently unconnected but somehow in the same ballpark. The newest problem was a <a data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://twitter.com/rgay/status/1159508325526056961"}' data-offer-url="https://twitter.com/rgay/status/1159508325526056961" href="https://twitter.com/rgay/status/1159508325526056961">racially tinged Twitter spat</a> between <strong>Roxane Gay</strong> (who sometimes moonlights as a <em>Times</em> opinion columnist) and deputy Washington editor <strong>Jonathan Weisman,</strong> who was <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/08/ny-times-is-examining-washington-editors-poor-judgement-on-social-media-1453576">publicly rebuked</a> by the <em>Times</em>’s communications department: “Jonathan has repeatedly displayed poor judgment on social media and in responding to criticism. We’re closely examining what to do about it.” (A <em>Times</em> spokesperson didn’t have any updates on Monday.)</p>
<p>Baquet convened a town hall on Monday afternoon to address the convulsions. “There was enough stuff that happened that it seemed like a good time to talk it out and hear from people,” an editor familiar with his thinking told me. “I think this is a really difficult story to cover, the story of Donald Trump and race and his character. We’re in a bit of uncharted territory. There is definitely some friction over, how does the paper position itself? I don’t think you could argue that we haven’t been tough on Donald Trump. There’s real debate, and some real disappointment, about how we position ourselves as an institution.” Another editor said, “What I think is really going on is, reporters on the front lines, particularly reporters of color, are really attuned to something happening in the country that is, to a lot of them, deeply scary, both personally and politically, and there’s a hunger to have a conversation about it. If this rhetoric continues, how is the <em>Times</em> covering it? What are the rules of engagement for a president who traffics in this stuff? How do we, as a newsroom, grapple with that?”</p>
<p>Despite all the furor, Monday’s town hall was described to me as “very calm” and “civilized.” People wanted to hear from Baquet about how the headline snafu happened. It also became clear that there was a fair amount of internal discord over the <em>Times</em>’s halting use of the term “racist,” such as when the paper didn’t describe as such Trump’s attacks on the four congresswomen of color known as the Squad. When <em>can</em> the <em>Times</em> use that word? Only when it is clear and obvious beyond a shadow of a doubt, replied Baquet, who is the <em>Times</em>’s first black executive editor. He argued that it’s more effective and powerful to illustrate racism through reporting. “I don’t think everyone was satisfied with Dean’s answer, but I think people acknowledged that he’s very attuned to their concerns,” an attendee told me. At one point during the standing-room-only session, publisher <strong>A.G. Sulzberger,</strong> who was listening from the sidelines, interjected to emphasize that, among the paper’s leadership, there are robust discussions around these issues. “This is a really hard story,” Baquet said.</p>
<p>Last week’s drama appears to have underscored a <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/04/a-woke-civil-war-is-simmering-at-the-new-york-times">gulf</a> between some veteran <em>Times</em> journalists and an increasingly influential and vocal cohort of typically younger, next-generation employees. To boil down the nuance as simply as possible, the former camp sometimes views the latter as hypersensitive and politicized; the latter sometimes views the former as blindly tethered to tradition. As a more traditional <em>Times</em> reporter put it, “The headline was inelegant, it missed the point, it was poorly written, but it was not a federal hate crime, as you would think based on reactions from some people in the newsroom. The bigger issue is the culture of outrage.”</p>
<p>Baquet has other newsroom tensions to grapple with. In recent weeks, sources have been describing to me a growing sense of disillusionment among prominent female <em>Times</em> journalists, who have been huddling to hash out their concerns, including a string of high-ranking women leaving the institution for other publications where they “could have more power,” as one source said, describing a “feeling that the atmosphere at the top is too often not inclusive of women’s perspectives.” The latest instance to ratchet up that sentiment was the departure of <strong>Jodi Rudoren,</strong> who abdicated her position on the masthead a couple of weeks ago to become editor in chief of the Forward. Earlier this year, <strong>Susan Chira,</strong> who was one of the most senior editors at the <em>Times</em> and a beloved mentor to many younger women there, left to become editor in chief of the Marshall Project. In late 2016, <strong>Lydia Polgreen,</strong> a rising star, departed to become editor in chief of HuffPost. Other sources pushed back, citing the prominence of masthead figures such as <strong>Carolyn Ryan, Rebecca Blumenstein, Monica Drake,</strong> and <strong>Alison Mitchell.</strong></p>
<p>Issues regarding women at the <em>Times</em> didn’t come up during Monday’s town hall, which was an open forum for employees. That’s presumably because the dominant issue of the moment is, and will continue to be, all of the emotions and anger and conundrums that come with the territory of covering the most unusual and divisive presidency in American history. On that front, perhaps only one thing is certain. As one of the editors I spoke with put it, “There’s a clear feeling from the top that we’re not gonna be a part of the resistance, and how that gets translated day to day can frustrate people.”</p>
