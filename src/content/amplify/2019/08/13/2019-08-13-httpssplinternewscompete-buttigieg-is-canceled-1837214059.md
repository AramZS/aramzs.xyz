title: Pete Buttigieg Is Canceled
---
<p>My colleague Samantha Grasso really summed it up best:</p>
<p>An incredible, 100% accurate own. Now to be fair, the full quote makes it clear that Buttigieg is <a href="https://twitter.com/cspan/status/1161357102532763648">referring to hand soap</a>, but I think the point stands. Also, let’s not kid ourselves: teenagers are extremely enviable, brilliant idiots, and they WILL take this to mean that they can wash their body with dish soap. Why don’t we fix the student debt crisis so they can buy some dang Dial without crippling anxiety??</p>
<p>If you can believe it, this wasn’t even the strangest thing happening with Mayor Pete today.</p>
<p>Alrighty then!! Stay safe out there, Pete. Iowa is fuckin weird.</p>
