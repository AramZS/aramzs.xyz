<p>They call him Lord Fairfax: A 65-lb turtle found lumbering through a Virginia neighborhood puzzling the locals</p>
<p>He was out of place for sure. His species – the alligator snapping turtle – isn’t native to the area. <br/>
 They’re aquatic creatures preferring the rivers further south than in a suburb.</p>
<p>And yet, that’s where authorities found him - near a residential pond in Fairfax County.</p>
<p>No one knows how he got there. But authorities can hazard a guess.</p>
<p>Lord Fairfax was most likely bred in captivity, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10156985784721498&amp;id=88223336497">the Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries said</a>.</p>
<p>“If you are considering a turtle as a pet, please do your homework first and find out what it takes to provide adequate care for a lifelong commitment,” the department said. <br/>
 At 65 lbs, Lord Fairfax was a youngster. Fully grown, this species can exceed 200 lbs.</p>
<p>The turtle never would have posed much of a threat to the locals. But he most likely would have died slowly from freezing or starvation, the department said.</p>
<p>But this story has a happy ending.</p>
<p>A biologist picked him up and Lord Fairfax now has a new home at the Virginia Zoo in Norfolk.</p>
