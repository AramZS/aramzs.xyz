  Bill Simmons is facing backlash for his comments about the lack of diversity
  at his company, The Ringer, and his dismissive attitude towards criticism. His
  history of insubordination and self-serving behavior has contributed to a
  negative perception of him as a leader. Despite his wealth and success, he
  seems to remain out of touch with important social issues and the voices of
  marginalized employees.

title: 'Drew Magary: Bill Simmons has had this coming for a long time now'
---
<p>Understand that Bill Simmons isn't gonna learn a goddamn thing from this. The founder of The Ringer is getting his ass kicked online right now because of an interview he gave to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/22/business/media/bill-simmons-the-ringer-black-employees.html/">Noam Scheiber of the New York Times</a> about his company's poor track record hiring minorities for positions of editorial leadership, and about the company's resulting internal turmoil over it. Scheiber's piece describes writer K. Austin Collins's story about how he and other BIPOC employees were quickly phased out of one of The Ringer's more successful podcasts in favor of interchangeable white guys. Simmons, who plays defense about as well as he does when he plays point guard at the Hancock Park Equinox, countered Collins thusly:</p>
<p>"It's a business. This isn't Open Mic Night."</p>
<p>People far and wide are gonna hang that quote around Simmons' neck. As others have already pointed out, Simmons gave his daughter a podcast, hired his nephew (who subsequently recorded a diss track complaining about The Ringer's employees daring to unionize), and has generally followed the Kimmel/Sandler model of hiring staff like he's inviting friends and relatives over for a cookout. He also reportedly has a tight inner circle at his own company, and you can probably guess the number of Black people in it. A meritocracy this is not. So, in just eight simple words emailed to a reporter, he laid bare his open disdain for anyone who dares question how he goes about his business. In his own words, and in the paper of record, Simmons bitchily told the world that he's just another rich 50-year-old asshole now. Most concise bit of writing he's ever done.</p>
<p>This has been a long time coming. Simmons began his career as ESPN's resident voice of the fan and, over the span of two decades, built an empire out of being a Cocky Dickbag Who Thinks He Should Run Every NBA Team And Movie Studio. One editor who used to work with Simmons at ESPN said they once sent him notes on an article and his only reply was, "stet all changes." He never found any criticism of him constructive.</p>
<p>Simmons was eventually fired from ESPN for general insubordination, such as the time he dared the network to fire him for declaring Roger Goodell a liar on his podcast (FULL DISCLOSURE: Roger Goodell <em>is</em> a liar). Simmons always painted himself as the rebel inside ESPN despite being a white Boston fan who went to Holy Cross, which represents a solid 75% of that network's staffing demographics. Essentially, the only thing Simmons was rebelling against at ESPN was anyone daring to NOT fit in that demo. When he wrote a column about how watching sports with women ruins the ambience, SportsCenter anchor Chris McKendry was so pissed that she wrote <a href="https://www.espn.com/page2/s/mckendry/021016.html">a formal rebuttal</a>.</p>

Ask people who used to work with him! Emailing the Times, he took off a mask that he was barely able to keep on to begin with. He’s exactly the same brat that he was at the turn of the century. He’s not a naked racist like Dave Portnoy of Barstool. He’s not a strategic reactionary like the current iteration of Dennis Miller. He’s a little rich boy who doesn’t want to get dirty looks when he pops over to Soho House for a cocktail. He just wants the big mean outrage mob to leave him be. There are BIPOC employees at The Ringer, and Simmons’ Grantland subsite at ESPN once had bylines from the likes of Wesley Morris and Colson Whitehead. But of course there’s nothing to indicate that Simmons cared about these writers, or about their work. He has the intellectual curiosity of a Trump child. At both his sites, he has collected writers like they’re trophies he can display in his mancave. He hasn’t learned a thing from any of them.  In fact, The Ringer’s collective voice reads like Simmons commanding his writers and podcasters to continually talk about the six ‘80s movies that, as a collective, represent the only pop culture he’s ever consumed. Simmons himself no longer writes, which is for the best because he never got better as a writer. His entire writing archive now is just a pile of self-referencing garbage." src="https://s.hdnux.com/photos/01/12/57/32/19592863/3/1200x0.jpg"/></picture><figcaption>Randy Holmes/Walt Disney Television via Getty // Pictured: Bill Simmons (left) and Jimmy Kimmel (right)</figcaption></figure>
