<p>You don’t support the troops. If you did, you wouldn’t want this. You wouldn’t want a war with Iran, a country that has more people and is significantly larger than Iraq and Afghanistan combined. You wouldn’t want our military to be sentenced to yet another string of decades spent halfway around the world, in service of yet another war that ends with the United States stuck in a situation where it is unable to help a country any further but also unable to ever leave it.</p>
<p>You wouldn’t want more lies. Our armed forces have spent almost the entirety of this century marooned in Afghanistan based on what quickly became an ever-shifting foundation of<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/investigations/afghanistan-papers/afghanistan-war-confidential-documents/"> lies, excuses, unknown goals, poor leadership, and abject carelessness</a>. You wouldn’t treat our military like it’s <a href="https://deadspin.com/the-nfls-salute-to-service-is-horseshit-1464308797">a fucking sports team you follow</a>, cheering them on to their deaths because you don’t ever want them to have an offseason. You wouldn’t want military leaders, <a href="https://twitter.com/vermontgmg/status/1214702040817061888?s=21">what few we have left in charge</a>, displaying open bravado about their ability to create entire populations of <a href="https://twitter.com/IsraelUSAforevr/status/1214626922946334720">orphans</a>. You can wave a foam finger and rah-rah that shit all you like from back home because, as it is with the president, this is all just a form of strange entertainment to you. You are addicted to the bigness of war and your blind enthusiasm feeds right back into political and media complexes that gladly feast off of it.</p>
<p>If you supported the troops, you’d fucking hate war. A lot of <a href="http://bit.ly/4WTcOk">them</a> sure do. You’d want the troops stuck on a base somewhere in Germany, doing training exercises and cleaning out equipment and visiting beer halls; prepping for a war that never, ever comes. You wouldn’t want them attacked with weapons designed from weapons <a href="https://twitter.com/bubbaprog/status/1214764733687091202?s=21">given</a> to the enemy by earlier generations of our military. And you would actually give a shit that those weapons killed Iraqis — the very same people America was tasked by former President George W. Bush with supposedly protecting — instead of our precious troops.</p>
