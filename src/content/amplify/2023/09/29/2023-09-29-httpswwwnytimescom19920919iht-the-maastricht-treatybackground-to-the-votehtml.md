<p>The Treaty:</p>
<p>Complements theTreaty of Rome, the European Community's founding charter.</p>
<p>Formally substitutes the term "European Community" for the original "European Economic Community," signifying a more profound commitment to the idea of European political and economic union.</p>
<p>Will create a common currency, foster a common foreign and defense policy and introduce a common citizenship.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Common Citizenship:</p>
<p>Some 340 million Europeans will have the formal status of citizens of the union as well as of their own countries.</p>
<p>No matter where they live and work within the Community, they will be able to vote and run as candidates in both municipal elections and in elections for the European Parliament.</p>
<p>When outside the Community, they will be able to turn for assistance to the embassies or consulates of any EC nation. Mutual recognition of qualifications is designed to make it easier for self-employed persons to work in other countries.</p>

<p>A Common Currency:</p>
<p>The Maastricht treaty calls for the adoption of the existing unit of account, the Ecu, as a common currency by Jan. 1, 1999, at the latest, replacing present national currencies.</p>
