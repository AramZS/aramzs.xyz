<p>WASHINGTON, Oct. 1—The Washington Post, the nation's seventh‐largest newspaper, was forced to cease publication temporarily today by what company officials called an antimanagement outburst of vandalism in its pressroom by striking members of a pressmen's union. All of The Post's 72 printing units were said to have been sabotaged.</p>
<p>The predawn vandalism and arson in the basement and subbasement of The Post's downtown building at Sixteenth and L Streets N. W. was followed this afternoon by an angry, jostling and name‐calling confrontation between picketing pressmel, and members of the Washington‐Baltimore Newspaper Guild, the editorial and clerical union. Many guild members said they were crossing the picket line to protest what happened in the pressroom.</p>
<p>The pressmen, members of the Newspaper and Graphic Communications Union, struck about 4:45 o'clock this morning, after their contract with The Post expired at midnight.</p>
<p>Union spokesmen said that they had offered last night to extend the contract deadline if Post negotiators would begin nonstop talks with them.</p>
<p>But a pressmen's union official said that Lawrence A. WalIace, the newspaper chief negotiator, had broken off yesterday's talks at 9:30 P.M., preciptating the walkout.</p>
<p>The issue of work practices, in particular the number of men needed to run the presses, is reported to he a key one in the dispute.</p>
<p>Mr. Wallace and other company officials were described as unavailable for personal or telephone interviews today in the closely guarded Post building. Martis J. Davis, the company's director of community affairs, was available to newsmen, but said he did not know about many details of they labor‐management bargaining.</p>
<p>James A. Dugan, president of the striking pressmen's Local 6, commenting today about the vandalism, said: “We're not admitting anything or taking any responsibility. We authorized no action like that—exactly the opposite—because we think withholding our labor is enough.”</p>
<p>“Anything that has happened, the management must take full responsibility for,” he said. “They have harassed and reprimanded the men. They want to chang the manning tables and our hiring practices. They were stalling since December on a new contract. We had not even gotten to wages. The men were upset.”</p>
<p>How long The Post, the city's only morning newspaper, would have to suspend publication because of the sabotage was unclear tonight. Estimates ranged from several days to weeks.</p>
<p><strong>No Other Presses Available</strong></p>
<p>Efforts by Post officials to attempt an immediate resumption of publication by using presses at other nearby newspapers reportedly had not been successful by tonight.</p>
<p>Another complication is that the Goss Company of Cicero, Ill., manufacturers of most large presses used by newspapers, has been on strike. Thus, obtaining replacement parts for the damaged presses may be difficult.</p>
<p>The Post said that when its pressmen went off their jobs about 4:45 A.M. today, they took with them most of the small, detachable chucks used to support the one‐and‐a‐halfton reels of newsprint fed upward from the subbasement to the press units on the basement level. It was not clear how soon these parts could be replaced.</p>
<p>During a tour of the damaged pressroom this morning, scores of damaged reels of newsprint were seen lying at crazy angles in their cradles. The removable reel chucks, which rotate into a locked position like the breech of an artillery piece, were missing from long lines of massive paper‐handling machines.</p>
<p><strong>Damage Assessed</strong></p>
<p>In a detailed assessment of the pressroom damage late this afternoon, The Post said that none of its presses were operational.</p>
<p>On many a statement said, the printing plates for this morning's paper could not be removed because locking keys. inserted in holes on the press cylinders to remove and secure the curved, cast‐metal plates, had been broken off in place.</p>
<p>All but 50,000 of today' scheduled 550,000 copies of The Post had been printed and were being distributed when what one company spokesman called “a riot” erupted in the pressroom.</p>
<p>The Post said that James Hover, the night pressroom foreman and a member of the striking Local 6, had been attacked while attempting to prevent some of the vandalism and had required 12 stitches to close a gash over his left eye.</p>
<p>Mr. Hover reportedly told Post executives that he had also been threatened with a screwdriver, held against his chest, and had been told his home would be burned if he reported the names of the vandais. Mr. Hover could not be reached for comment tonight.</p>
<p>The Post statement said a fire set in the paper handling room had done “extensive damage” to three printing units.</p>
<p>The Post statement said that the “extensive damage”—covered by both damage and business interruption insurance —“appears to have been executed by people who had preplanned and synchronized their actions.” The statement continued: “It would be impossible for these kinds of damage to be done in that short a time without a plan, without assigned asks and without people who knew precisely what they were doing.”</p>
<p>Local 6 represents 263 pressmen and stereotypers. The Post has a total of about 2,800 employes.</p>
<p>By tonight, the police reported that sixteen persons had been arrested in picket line scuffling—all of them pickets. Fifteen were charged with disorderly conduct and one with carrying a deadly weapon.</p>
<p>Some reporters and other editorial workers criticized the vandalism in the pressroom at a two‐hour meeting of the Post unit of The Newspaper Guild. The guildsmen then voted by an overwhelming show of hands to cross the picket line.</p>
<p>In a statement at midmorning, The Post announced that it was temporarily furloughing —“locking out,” union officials said—all members of the pressmen's, typographiCal, paper handlers' and mailroom workers' unions. Guild members, electricians and machinists were told they should report for work.</p>
