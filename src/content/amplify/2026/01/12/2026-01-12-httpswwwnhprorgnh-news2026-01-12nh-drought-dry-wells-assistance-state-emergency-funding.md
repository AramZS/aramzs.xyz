<p>As New Hampshire’s drought continues, state officials have re-started a program to help homeowners with water supply issues.</p>
<p>Almost 250 residents have reported their wells going dry, according to New Hampshire’s Department of Environmental Services, amid a <a href="https://www.nhpr.org/nh-news/2026-01-02/nh-drought-conditions-2025-2026-new-year"><u>historic</u></a> drought.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dwgtf.des.nh.gov/funding-programs/emergency-drought-assistance"><u>Emergency Drought Assistance Program</u></a> is meant to help low-income households with the expense of drilling new wells, rehabilitating existing wells, or connecting to public water systems. Officials say $1.5 million has been set aside for that program.</p>
<p>Approved applicants will get <a href="https://www.dwgtf.des.nh.gov/sites/g/files/ehbemt731/files/documents/11-17-25-ac-handouts4.pdf"><u>50% or 100%</u></a> of their drought-related projects covered, depending on income. Options are available for households making under 80% of New Hampshire’s <a href="https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/il/il2025/2025summary.odn?inputname=STTLT*3399999999%2BNew+Hampshire&amp;selection_type=county&amp;stname=New+Hampshire&amp;statefp=33.0&amp;year=2025"><u>median household income</u></a>.</p>
<p>The summer of 2025 was the <a href="https://www.nhpr.org/nh-news/2025-09-25/2025-nh-driest-summer-ever-recorded-drought"><u>driest ever recorded</u></a> in New Hampshire, and severe drought conditions <a href="https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/CurrentMap/StateDroughtMonitor.aspx?NH"><u>continue</u></a> in much of the state.</p>
<p>The drought is projected to continue into the spring. State officials <a href="https://newhampshirebulletin.com/2025/12/09/as-emergency-dry-well-assistance-is-reinstated-new-hampshires-drinking-water-future-still-unclear/"><u>have said</u></a> they’re looking to solutions like building long-term data sets and digging larger wells to mitigate the impacts of drought conditions moving forward.</p>
