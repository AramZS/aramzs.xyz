<p>One weekend in 2006, Dean Devlin, a movie producer, was driving across Los Angeles to deal with an emergency. His new movie, <em>Flyboys,</em> had opened that weekend to reviews so bad that one of the stars had abruptly checked into the hospital. On his way to visit the actor, another potential crisis appeared on his phone. “I was terrified when the phone rang and it was Larry Ellison,” Devlin said.</p>
<p>Devlin had made a name for himself with a string of blockbusters in the 1990s — <em>Stargate, Independence Day, Godzilla</em> — but he’d struggled to come up with the money to make <em>Flyboys,</em> a script about a band of World War I fighter pilots. Then, in a stroke of luck, he learned that Ellison, the founder of Oracle and one of the world’s richest men, had a college-age son named David who was not only trying to break into Hollywood but was also an amateur pilot. David even had a nascent film-production company with an aerial name: <a href="https://www.vulture.com/tags/skydance/">Skydance</a>. Larry agreed to help fund the movie, which cost $60 million, and Skydance was listed as a producer. David, meanwhile, got a plum role, alongside James Franco, as a pilot named Eddie who can’t shoot straight. “Come on, Eddie,” David says to himself in the climactic fight scene. “Do something right.”</p>
<p>Devlin thought he knew why Larry was calling. <em>Flyboys</em> had bombed at the box office, and Larry stood to lose millions.</p>
