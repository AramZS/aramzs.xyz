<p>From <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-12/powell-says-justice-department-served-fed-with-subpoenas">Bloomberg</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the US central bank had been served grand jury subpoenas from the Justice Department threatening a criminal indictment, a dramatic escalation of the Trump administration’s attacks on the Fed.</p> <p>In an interview with NBC News on Sunday, Trump denied having any knowledge of the DOJ’s investigation into the central bank.</p> <p>The US dollar weakened on the news, falling against all its major counterparts, while gold extended gains to a record high. Futures on the S&amp;P 500 Index fell 0.3%.</p> <p>Powell said the Fed was served the subpoenas on Friday. The unprecedented move by the Trump administration marks an escalation of President Donald Trump’s longstanding feud with the Fed chair.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20260111a.htm">Chairman Powell’s response</a> is here. The most concise explanation for these events:</p>
<blockquote><p>This new threat is not about my testimony last June or about the renovation of the Federal Reserve buildings. It is not about Congress’s oversight role; the Fed through testimony and other public disclosures made every effort to keep Congress informed about the renovation project. Those are pretexts. The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the President.</p></blockquote>
