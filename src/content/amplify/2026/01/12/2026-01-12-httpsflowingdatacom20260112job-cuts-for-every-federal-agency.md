<p>Based on November data released by the <a href="https://data.opm.gov/explore-data/analytics/workforce-size-and-composition">Office of Personnel Management</a>, the federal workforce is 220,000 workers fewer in this administration. For the New York Times, Emily Badger, Francesca Paris, and Alicia Parlapian provides a searchable table for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2026/01/09/upshot/trump-workforce-cuts-table.html?unlocked_article_code=1.D1A.JNsr.aEoUErB6comD&amp;smid=url-share">how each agency was affected and the year-over-year change</a>.</p>
<p>Of note:</p>
<blockquote><p>Amid all the cuts, one agency has notably swelled: Immigration and Customs Enforcement expanded by about 30 percent through November, and more new hires have been announced since as the Trump administration continues to ramp up its deportation campaign.</p></blockquote>
