title: Google co-founders may be leaving California
---
<p>Sergey Brin and Larry Page appear to be reducing their presence in the state where they co-founded Google.</p>
<p>The New York Times reports that in December, 15 limited liability companies overseeing Brin’s investments and interests were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/09/technology/google-founders-california-wealth-tax.html">terminated or converted into Nevada entities</a>. Those include LLCs that manage one of his superyachts and his interest in a private terminal at the San Jose International Airport.</p>
<p>Similarly, 45 LLCs associated with Page have recently become inactive or moved out of state, and a trust associated with Page bought a $71.9 million mansion in Miami this week, according to the NYT.</p>
<p>Clearly, moving is not a simple, black-and-white thing for the ultra-rich, and Brin and Page both still own homes in the state, the NYT says. Still, these moves suggest that at least two of California’s billionaires are indeed hoping to dodge <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/26/technology/california-wealth-tax-page-thiel.html">a prospective ballot measure</a> that would impose a one-time, 5% tax on individuals worth more than $1 billion.</p>
<p>If the measure makes it onto the ballot in November and actually passes, it would retroactively apply to anyone who lived in the state as of January 1 of this year.</p>
