title: How to know if that job will crush your soul

<p>"But these questions are framed in this way to encourage us all to aspire towards roles that enable us to do our best work, to have the biggest impact, and to live according to our values."</p>
<p>A good list of questions that will help you determine whether a job will be values-aligned or crush your soul from <a href="https://anildash.com/?ref=werd.io">Anil Dash</a>.</p>
<p>They also inform how to ask questions during an interview process. For example, Anil asks:</p>
<blockquote>“What’s the lived experience of the workers there whom you trust? Do you have evidence of leaders in the organization making hard choices to do the right thing?”</blockquote>
<p>If you don’t know — and if it’s not a big company, you probably don’t — the question becomes: how will you find out? The result will be a deeper and more meaningful hiring process.</p>
<p>But in addition to the values questions, Anil also asks about compensation and forward trajectory. These are important too. There’s no sense in taking a job that isn’t going to be sustainable for you, or won’t allow you to grow with it. In those situations, there’s barely a relationship; you’re ultimately just a resource.</p>
