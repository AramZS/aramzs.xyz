<p>There are times when you need to tell your friends that they are committing a grave mistake, even if they resent you for telling the truth. This is to say: I’m fairly confident that this column will get me banned from CNN’s airwaves.</p>
<p>CNN once sold itself as the grown-up in the room. It was the network you turned to when the stakes got real. That reputation — earned over decades — was built on restraint, seriousness, and a basic respect for viewers. Which is why CNN’s continued reliance on Scott Jennings is not just baffling, but corrosive to its brand.</p>
<p>This is not about ideology. CNN has long — and rightly — made room for conservative voices. The problem is not that Jennings is a Republican. The problem is how he behaves, what he contributes, and what his presence signals about what CNN now tolerates.</p>
<p>On air, Jennings does not debate; he blathers. He talks over women with particular frequency, interrupts relentlessly, and treats panel discussions as contests of volume and obstinacy, rather than as exchanges of ideas. He mugs to the camera and rolls his eyes, while calling any fact he does not like a lie. It is performative obstruction — the cable news equivalent of flipping the board when you’re losing the game.</p>
<p>This is not “spirited debate.”</p>
<p>Worse, Jennings’ relationship with the truth is, at best, optional. Viewers are routinely treated to assertions that collapse under minimal scrutiny, talking points that are repeated even after being challenged, and claims that rely more on confidence than evidence. CNN once prided itself on fact-checking in real time. Now it often lets falsehoods linger in the air, unanswered, as long as they are delivered with sufficient bluster.</p>
<p>Jennings is also an insecure little boy, the kind of teenager who sat home alone on a Saturday night cutting and pasting photographs of himself alongside girls who would never give him the time of day to make it appear that he had a robust social life. That is essentially what he does every time he goes on air. He selectively edits clips to make it look like he “owned” whomever he was debating, too chickenshit to post the whole segment that would expose the truth. Aside from his collection of mouth-breathing Twitter acolytes, no one buys it.</p>
<p>That alone would be damaging. But the failure goes deeper.</p>
<p>Jennings has cultivated a reputation — not just among viewers, but among female guests — for being rude, dismissive, and antagonistic in ways that feel personal rather than substantive. His dynamic is familiar: interrupt, sneer, accuse, repeat. If challenged successfully, escalate the aggression.</p>
<p>CNN executives know this. They see the segments and receive the feedback. They understand the pattern. And yet, the network continues to book him, elevate him, and protect him.</p>
<p>The message this sends is unmistakable: decorum is optional, accuracy is negotiable, and if you are loud enough, management will treat you as indispensable.</p>
<p>It is also telling that Jennings is known for escalating disputes upward when things don’t go his way. When a fellow panelist out-argues him, he doesn’t sharpen his case. He complains. When a woman gets the better of him, the problem is not his performance, but hers. This is not the behavior of a serious person. It is the behavior of someone accustomed to institutional indulgence.</p>
<p>Several women who have appeared on CNN panels have spoken privately about how they are suddenly never invited back after embarrassing him on air. The belief is that he gets them banned — or at least put into a very long timeout.</p>
<p>Whether this is true or not, enough women have seen a pattern that they believe it.</p>
<p>CNN should ask itself a simple question: what is Scott Jennings adding that could not be accomplished by any number of conservative analysts who are capable of making arguments without bad faith theatrics?</p>
<p>The answer, uncomfortably, appears to be conflict for conflict’s sake. Jennings reliably generates clips and provokes reactions. And in an era when cable news executives are chasing engagement metrics, that reliability seems to matter more than integrity.</p>
<p>Maybe CNN would not have kept him on if Trump had lost the election but now that he has wormed his way into MAGA’s heart, the network seems to be held hostage to his behavior. Maybe CNN executives hope that Jennings will bring his new radio show audience to their airwaves or that Trump will go easier on the network if they continue employing him. Or maybe they are worried that Bari Weiss will be their boss one day soon and will hold it against them if they fire Jennings.</p>
<p>That is a Faustian bargain. Every time CNN allows a panel to devolve into Jennings shouting over his colleagues and guests, it trades credibility for clicks. Every time it lets misleading claims slide in the name of “balance,” it trains viewers not to trust what they’re seeing. And every time it tolerates conduct that makes guests — especially women — feel disrespected, it reinforces the perception that the network values spectacle over professionalism.</p>
<p>Why would anyone bother going on CNN if they can expect to be shouted down and interrupted? No one is that desperate to be on television, especially with all the other opportunities that now exist to get your point across.</p>
<p>CNN does not need to purge conservatives or take sides. What it needs to do is remember that standards are not partisan, accuracy is not ideological, and basic civility is not optional.</p>
<p>There was a time when CNN understood that. There was a time when having access to CNN’s air meant that you were expected to argue in good faith, respect your colleagues, and engage with reality as it exists, not as your talking points demand. Scott Jennings is a repudiation of that tradition.</p>
<p>Viewers notice. Guests notice. Journalists notice. Once trust is gone, it does not come back easily.</p>
<p>CNN’s legacy is not guaranteed. It is something the network either honors or squanders every day. Keeping Jennings as a fixture is not neutrality. It is a choice — a choice to debase discourse, excuse bad behavior, and signal that being loud matters more than being right.</p>
<p>CNN can do better. The question is whether it still wants to.</p>
