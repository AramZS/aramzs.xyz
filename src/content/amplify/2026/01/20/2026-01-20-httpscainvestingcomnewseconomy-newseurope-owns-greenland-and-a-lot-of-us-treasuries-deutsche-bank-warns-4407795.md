<p>Investing.com -- Europe’s confrontation with Washington over Greenland may carry far greater implications for global markets than trade alone, according to Deutsche Bank, which argues the dispute highlights a fundamental vulnerability in the U.S. economic model.</p>
<p>George Saravelos, head of FX research at Deutsche Bank, said the United States relies heavily on foreign capital to finance persistent external deficits, leaving it exposed at a moment when geopolitical cohesion among Western allies is being tested.</p>
<p>“For all its military and economic strength, the US has one key weakness: it relies on others to pay its bills via large external deficits,” Saravelos wrote.</p>
<p>Europe sits at the center of that dynamic. European investors own around $8 trillion of U.S. bonds and equities, almost double the holdings of the rest of the world combined, making the region America’s largest lender.</p>
<p>In Saravelos’s view, it is no longer obvious that Europe will continue to play this role unquestioningly if political pressure from Washington escalates. He noted that Danish pension funds were among the first to reduce dollar exposure last year, and said recent developments could accelerate broader dollar rebalancing across Europe, where U.S. exposure remains elevated.</p>
<p>The comments come as tensions flare over Greenland, after Donald Trump threatened escalating tariffs on several European allies unless the U.S. is allowed to purchase the autonomous Danish territory.</p>
<p>Denmark’s Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has said Europe “won’t be blackmailed,” while European leaders warned the tariff threats risk a dangerous spiral in transatlantic relations.</p>
<p>Saravelos drew a parallel with last year’s Munich Security Conference, where a speech by the U.S. vice president helped catalyse a sharp increase in European defence spending. He suggested Greenland could play a similar role politically, potentially accelerating European cohesion.</p>
<p>He pointed to the fact that even euro-sceptic far-right leaders in Germany and France have criticised Washington’s recent posture, arguing that the emergence of a unified European response would be a key signal for markets.</p>
<p>Beyond foreign exchange, Saravelos said Europe may believe it holds leverage ahead of U.S. midterm elections, particularly as the administration focuses on lowering inflation and Treasury yields.</p>
<p>He flagged the possibility that the European Union could activate its anti-coercion instrument and consider measures affecting capital markets rather than trade.</p>
<p>“With the US net international investment position at record negative extremes, the mutual inter-dependence of European-US financial markets has never been higher,” Saravelos said, adding that “it is a weaponization of capital rather than trade flows that would by far be the most disruptive to markets.”</p>
