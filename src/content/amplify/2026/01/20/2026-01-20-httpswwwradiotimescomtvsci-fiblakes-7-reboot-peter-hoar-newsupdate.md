<p>It's been almost 50 years since <a href="https://www.radiotimes.com/tv/sci-fi/its-the-40th-anniversary-of-blakes-7/">Blake's 7</a> first hit screens, but fans could be in for quite the comeback, as a reboot is in development!</p>
<p>Doctor Who and The Last of Us director Peter Hoar has opened a "genre-based" production company, Multitude Productions, and has acquired the IP for the iconic '70s and '80s sci-fi hit along with exec Matthew Bouch and producer Jason Haigh-Ellery, <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/01/blakes-7-reboot-peter-hoar-matthew-bouch-multitude-productions-1236682580/">Deadline</a> has confirmed.</p>
<p>The outlet adds that Bouch would "love it to go to the BBC", where the show originally aired from 1978 to 1981, depicting political dissident Roj Blake (Gareth Thomas) and his untrustworthy rebels amid their battle with the totalitarian Terran Federation.</p>
<p>Hoar told Deadline: "The Blake’s 7 story is legendary because they were given a ‘softly softly’ slot that was intended for police drama with a budget intended for one big set and a few location shoots.</p>
<p>"At the time it felt like it meant something. Those shows got into my veins. I could tell they didn’t have money but I was able to compartmentalise and enjoy the ride knowing that the sets wobbled."</p>

<p>Bouch added: "We’re driven by our passions but also seeing that there is a gap in the market in the UK – particularly with the well-publicised dropping off of Doctor Who – for genre-based British IP."</p>
<p>Multitude is also working on TV adaptations of Luke Rhinehart’s The Search for the Dice Man, Patrick Carman’s Skeleton Creek, and an adaptation of a currently unnamed "well-known video game and a sci-fi series".</p>
<p>Created by Doctor Who legend Terry Nation (who invented the Daleks), Blake's 7 quickly became a hit.</p>
<p>In 1978, producer David Maloney told <strong>Radio Times</strong>: "We’ve got something Star Wars doesn’t have – time to develop our plot, characters and action. They’ve got two hours we’ve got 12."</p>
<p>Of course, that's completely changed with the rise of streaming, with Hoar now directly comparing Blake's 7 to beloved Star Wars spin-off <a href="https://www.radiotimes.com/tv/sci-fi/andor-season-2-review/">Andor</a>, arguing that it succeeded not because of its budget, but "because of the integrity, wit and sophistication."</p>
