title: KNIGHTS IN SEARCH OF GLORY
---
<p>Take the Oath and venture into <em>Mythic Bastionland</em>, a tabletop RPG set in the imagined past of <em>Into the Odd </em>and <em>Electric Bastionland</em> , built on the same lightning fast, ultra-streamlined rules system. Designed by Chris McDowall and illustrated by Alec Sorensen.</p>
<p>Try the quickstart for free, with everything you need to run and play a game right away.</p>
<p>Also available in print at <a href="https://bastionlandpress.com/collections/all">Bastionland Press</a>, customers in the Americas should use <a href="https://plusoneexp.com/collections/bastionland-press">PlusOneExp</a> instead.</p>
<h3>KNIGHTS IN SEARCH OF GLORY</h3>
<p>In <em>Mythic Bastionland </em>you begin as a young knight errant, seeking the glory to lead warbands, earn a place in court, and rule your own domain. Glory is found in hunting the Myths of this world, manifesting them into reality while protecting the Realm from their strange influence.</p>
<p>Each player is one of 72 Knights, with personal equipment, a unique ability, and a passion that fuels their spirit. As your glory grows, you might eventually embark on the legendary City Quest, an impossible challenge to find The City itself, a shining metropolis seen only in dreams.</p>
<h3>RULES LIGHT, FLAVOUR HEAVY</h3>
<p>The streamlined rules support a campaign of exploration, where you traverse your own hex-mapped realm filled with myths, each slowly revealing their omens as you journey through their land. The book comes with 72 of these Myths, enough to know there's always a new surprise hidden in the woods.</p>
<p>Hex-crawling, domain management, ageing, exploration, and mass battles are all handled through fast, streamlined mechanics.</p>
<p>The rules of Mythic Bastionland are fast-paced and rules-light, encouraging creative problem solving and decisive combat. The game is perfect for groups of 1-5 players, plus a Referee, and is designed for both ongoing campaigns that span seasons and ages, and fast-paced one-shots that focus in on a particular adventure of a company of knights.</p>
<h3>DECISIVE COMBAT</h3>
<p>Nobody ever rolls to hit. You go straight to the damage roll. Every turn you decide to stay in the fight matters.</p>
<p>Use the new Gambit system to push enemies, splinter shields, drag them down from their steeds, and deftly reposition yourself. As Knights you also use Feats to <em>Smite </em>for extra damage, <em>Focus </em>on the perfect tactical manoeuvre, or <em>Deny </em>the strongest attacks of your foes.</p>
<p>This all sits on top of the same lightning-fast combat system familiar from <em>Into the Odd</em>.</p>
<h3>A PAST THAT NEVER WAS</h3>
<p><em>Mythic Bastionland </em>is inspired by British folklore, Arthurian legends, and our own myths of the medieval era. I'm especially interested in the lies we tell about history, whether by misconception or design.</p>
<p>Just as this game was written in 21st Century Britain, this world was born from the stories told in Industrial and Electric Bastionland.</p>
<p>A past that never was, brought to life, and a place that you can visit if you know the way.</p>
<h3>TESTIMONIALS</h3>
<p><em>"Chris McDowall is one of the best designers in the industry. His ability to cut away extraneous parts of a game is excelled only by his ability to write scant, evocative, unpretentious prose that paints fantastical worlds and leaves fascinating gaps for players and GMs alike to fill during play. Coupled with absurd amounts of Alec Sorensen's gorgeous artwork, Mythic Bastionland is something of a victory lap - McDowall has already proven he's got the chops, and quite frankly this sort of thing is just making the rest of us look lazy." </em><br/>
- <strong>Grant Howitt (Spire, Heart, Honey Heist)</strong></p>
<p><em>“McDowall is the pre-eminent distillation designer of our generation. Mythic Bastionland is pure elegance." </em><br/>
<strong>- Sean McCoy (Mothership, Two Rooms and a Boom)</strong></p>
<p><em>"Mythic Bastionland is a brilliant evolution of its predecessor's rules, marrying them to a setting filled with wonder, dread, mirth and sorrow."</em><br/>
- <strong>Ben Milton (Questing Beast, Knave, Maze Rats)</strong></p>
