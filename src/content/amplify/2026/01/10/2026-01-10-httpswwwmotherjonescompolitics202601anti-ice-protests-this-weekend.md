<p>Scores of people are once again <a href="https://www.mobilize.us/?tag_ids=29132">taking to their streets</a> this weekend to protest the Trump administration’s ongoing offensive against immigrants and those who attempt to stand up for them.</p>
<p>More than 1,000 demonstrations are slated for Saturday and Sunday after federal immigration agents shot three people in the past week. On Wednesday, ICE agent Jonathan Ross <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2026/01/ice-agent-shoots-and-kills-woman-in-minneapolis/">shot and killed</a> Renée Nicole Good in Minneapolis in her vehicle, and on Thursday US Border Patrol <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2026/01/federal-agents-shot-and-injured-two-people-in-portland-one-day-after-renee-goods-killing/">shot</a> a man and a woman in a car in Portland.</p>
<p>“The murder of Renée Nicole Good has sparked outrage in all of us,” Leah Greenberg, co-executive director of Indivisible, one of the organizations spearheading the nationwide demonstrations, told <em>Mother Jones</em>. “Her death, and the horrific nature of it, was a turning point and a call to all of us to stand up against ICE’s inhumane and lawless operations that have already killed dozens before Renee.”</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.mobilize.us/map/?lat=33.25299829997174&amp;lon=-101.84823989868164&amp;tag_ids=29132&amp;zoom=8.05994702899103">weekend protests</a> are happening or poised to happen in blue cities like New York and Chicago, as well as Republican strongholds like Lubbock, Texas, and Danville, Kentucky.</p>
<p>The demonstrations are being organized by the ICE Out For Good Coalition, which in addition to Indivisible, includes groups like the American Civil Liberties Union, Voto Latino, and United We Dream.</p>
<p>“For a full year, Trump’s masked agents have been abducting people off the streets, raiding schools, libraries, and churches,” Katie Bethell, the civic action executive director for MoveOn, another organization in the coalition, said. “None of us want to live in a country where federal agents with guns are lurking and inciting violence at schools and in our communities.”</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2026/jan/04/ice-2025-deaths-timeline">tracking</a> from <em>The Guardian</em>, 32 people died in ICE custody in 2025—the most of any year in more than two decades.</p>
<p>Additionally, <a data-id="https://www.thetrace.org/2025/12/immigration-ice-shootings-guns-tracker/" data-type="link" href="https://www.thetrace.org/2025/12/immigration-ice-shootings-guns-tracker/"><em>The Trace</em></a> reports that since June 2025, there have been 16 incidents in which immigration agents opened fire and another 15 incidents in which agents held someone at gunpoint. The outlet writes that, in these incidents, four people were killed and seven injured. <em>The Trace</em> noted that the number of incidents involving guns could likely be higher, “as shootings involving immigration agents are not always publicly reported.”</p>

<p>Since Wednesday, an already tense <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/12/ice-somali-minneapolis-operation-metro-surge/">situation</a> in Minneapolis—and in other cities—<a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2026/01/minneapolis-ice-renee-good-shooting-protests/">boiled over</a>. In the immediate aftermath of the shooting, officers on the scene met protesters with chemical irritants. In the days since, border patrol agents outside the Whipple Building in Minneapolis have used violent tactics against protesters, including <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_beP96DH3Y">using</a> chemical agents on demonstrators.</p>
<p>Online, some videos show escalating moments between immigration agents and those resisting them. In one <a href="https://x.com/MattFinnFNC/status/2009686113632297130?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E2009686113632297130%7Ctwgr%5Ef73d87b118ceba7b672e3b960b72041ffef66559%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.themirror.com%2Fnews%2Fus-news%2Fice-agents-chilling-6-word-1609295">instance</a>, a border patrol agent is seen telling multiple women sitting in cars in Minneapolis: “Don’t make a bad decision today.” The women were seemingly attempting to interrupt immigration agents by taking up road space.</p>
<p>The coalition hosting the protests said in its list of stated goals that the groups hope to “Demand accountability, transparency, and an immediate investigation into the killing of Renee Nicole Good,” “Build public pressure on elected officials and federal agencies,” and “Call for ICE to leave our communities,” among other aims.</p>

<p>These are just the latest protests to take over cities since President Donald Trump was sworn in for the second time. In April, it was the “Hands Off!” <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/04/hands-off-donald-trump-fear-new-york-city/">protest</a> against Trump and Elon Musk’s gutting of government spending and firing of federal workers. Months later, in October, the “No Kings” <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/10/heres-what-no-kings-looked-like-across-the-world/">demonstrations</a> sought to call out Trump’s growing, often unchecked executive power. According to organizers, each saw millions of protesters. And now, only the second weekend of the new year, people are once again angry and outside.</p>
<p>“The shootings in Minneapolis and Portland were not the beginning of ICE’s cruelty, but they need to be the end,” Deirdre Schifeling, chief political and advocacy officer with the ACLU, said. “These tragedies are simply proof of one fact: the Trump administration and its federal agents are out of control, endangering our neighborhoods, and trampling on our rights and freedom. This weekend Americans all across the country are demanding that they stop.”</p>
