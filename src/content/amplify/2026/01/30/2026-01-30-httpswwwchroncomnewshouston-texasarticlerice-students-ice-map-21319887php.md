<p>Last spring,<a data-link="native" href="https://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/pasadena-raid-texas-ice-standoff-dhs-21125452.php"> as ICE raids spread through</a> Southeast Houston, Jack Vu watched fear and uncertainty ripple through the community he had long volunteered in. <a data-link="native" href="https://www.chron.com/news/article/texas-republican-alex-pretti-minneapolis-21314647.php">The heartbreaking reality was impossible to ignore</a>—and from that, a new idea was born.</p>
<p>Vu, alongside fellow Houston-native and Rice University student Abby Manuel, created ICE Map—a nationwide digital spotlight on U.S. <a data-link="native" href="https://www.chron.com/politics/article/houston-mayor-ice-21319721.php">Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)</a> arrests and detention centers.</p>
<p>The idea first came to fruition when Vu unexpectedly found himself with more free time than he anticipated. His Saturday volunteer program working with children in the Lawndale-Wayside area of Houston essentially shuttered—a casualty of the community's fear of federal immigration sweeps.</p>
<p>"We would run this enrichment program, and…all of a sudden, it all went away," Vu told Chron on Wednesday. "The kids wouldn't leave their houses. They weren't even going to school."</p>
<p>Infuriated, Vu confided in his computer-science classmate Manuel. The 19-year-olds then put their skills to work, spending countless weekends sitting in a Rice Village tea shop, working to shed light on what was largely hidden from public view.</p>
<p>Using a web scraper known as Media Cloud, ICE Map aggregates data from local and national news, filters it by county, and plots it on a public map, giving users <a data-link="native" href="https://www.chron.com/news/article/dallas-valet-fired-tiktok-ice-hotel-21293107.php">a clear view of ICE activity unfolding</a> almost in real time. It also logs inspection reports for immigration detention facilities, flagging where they fall short.</p>

<p>"My main goal was for people to know what was going on with ICE because they're making a deliberate effort to sort of hide what they're doing," Vu said. "They're engaging in these public activities across the country that are often only captured in small publications and need to be surfaced."</p>
<p>The <a data-link="native" href="https://www.chron.com/politics/article/city-most-ice-arrests-houston-21260555.php">Houston area ranks among the nation's highest</a> for ICE arrests, making the platform especially relevant locally. But its use has extended far beyond city limits. Humanitarian and climate change activist Greta Thunberg, CHNGE, and other nationally-recognized sources have shared the map publicly, <a data-link="native" href="https://ricethresher.org/article/freshmen-create-website-mapping-ice-incidents-20260128">as reported by The Rice Thresher. </a></p>
<p>"All of a sudden, this week, Jack texted me (that) Greta Thunberg just posted our site on social media," Manuel said. "I was honestly astounded…it was an amazing thing to see."</p>
<p>While ICE Map faced some pushback when it launched in June 2025, the response has largely been positive.</p>
<p>"We're just glad to see that people in the community are using our tool and appreciating it and seeing it for what it is, which is just a resource of finding information and getting rid of some of that fear," Manuel said.</p>
<p>Since its launch, ICE Map has secured at least 68 donations—something that Manuel and Vu said has allowed for enhanced maintenance, continued development and possible expansion of the tool.</p>
<p>With tensions at a peak after<a data-link="native" href="https://www.chron.com/politics/article/texans-protest-minneapolis-ice-shooting-21284754.php"> ICE agents fatally shot Renee Nicole Good</a> and<a data-link="native" href="https://www.chron.com/news/article/texas-republican-alex-pretti-minneapolis-21314647.php"> Alex Pretti in Minneapolis this month</a>, ICE enforcement tactics remain under the public microscope. The Trump administration has recently found itself under fire after government statements on the death of Pretti <a data-link="native" href="https://www.chron.com/news/article/videos-show-deadly-minneapolis-shooting-21314648.php">conflicted with video footage documenting the incident. </a></p>
<p>As federal agents continue to patrol communities—with more than 22,000 agents deployed—ICE Map continues to lend an eye to truth, transparency and accountability that transcends party lines, pulling from both left and right-leaning news sources.</p>
<p>"We're not trying to shape individuals' immigration views. We're just trying to make sure that everyone, no matter where they are, is aware of what's going on (and) what's happening in their community," Manuel said.</p>
