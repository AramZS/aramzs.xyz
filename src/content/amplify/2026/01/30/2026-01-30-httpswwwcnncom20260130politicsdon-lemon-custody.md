<p>Journalist Don Lemon was taken into custody on Thursday night, according to his attorney.</p>
<p>Lemon was with dozens of anti-Immigration and Customs Enforcement protesters as they rushed into Cities Church in St. Paul, Minnesota, earlier this month, interrupting a church service and leading to tense confrontations.</p>
<p>“Don Lemon was taken into custody by federal agents last night in Los Angeles, where he was covering the Grammy awards,” his attorney Abbe Lowell said in a statement early Friday. “Don has been a journalist for 30 years, and his constitutionally protected work in Minneapolis was no different than what he has always done. The First Amendment exists to protect journalists whose role it is to shine light on the truth and hold those in power accountable.”</p>
<p>“Instead of investigating the federal agents who killed two peaceful Minnesota protesters, the Trump Justice Department is devoting its time, attention and resources to this arrest, and that is the real indictment of wrongdoing in this case,” Lowell added. “This unprecedented attack on the First Amendment and transparent attempt to distract attention from the many crises facing this administration will not stand. Don will fight these charges vigorously and thoroughly in court.”</p>
<p>Lemon, a former CNN anchor, has said that he was present at the demonstration as a journalist and not as a protester. In a video of the episode that he posted on YouTube, Lemon says “I’m just here photographing, I’m not part of the group… I’m a journalist.”</p>
<p>Still, senior Justice Department officials immediately and publicly asserted that Lemon would face charges. Lemon did not have a right to be on the church’s private property, they’ve said, and interrupting a church service may have impeded in the churchgoers’ constitutional rights to express their religion.</p>
<p>Attorney General Pam Bondi denounced the protest during a visit to Minneapolis, saying in a Fox News interview that the scene was “horrific.” She did not reference Lemon specifically.</p>
<p>CNN has reached out to the Department of Justice for for information.</p>
