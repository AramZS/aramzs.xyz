<p>The movement to oppose the surge of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement here in Minnesota is succeeding in part because it’s not just about politics — it’s a caregiving social movement based on relatedness and belonging.</p>
<p>The Resistance — a shorthand for the massive, decentralized organized opposition to the Trump administration and especially this ICE incursion — incorporates aspects of social clubs to build togetherness.</p>
<p>Twin Cities Democratic Socialists of America, Sierra Club and Twin Cities Indivisible host gatherings such as softball games, brewery nights, and book clubs. Casual relationships reduce loneliness and expedite activism. Clubs achieve political outcomes despite organizing as social groups.</p>
<p>The Behind Bars bike shop facilitates group rides that double as local political history lessons, and Twin Cities bookstores and bars, such as A Bar of Their Own in Minneapolis, host reading clubs dedicated to political education. Free Cycle, a nonprofit bike shop, distributes free bikes to Minnesotans under 25 experiencing homelessness, an example of what’s known as mutual aid.</p>
<p>Mutual aid is the practice of peer-to-peer assistance that closes gaps in government services. It includes buying and donating groceries and observing ICE raids to protect vulnerable populations from harm.</p>
<p>Mutual aid became popular during the 2020 COVID-19 lockdowns, and rural and minority communities have used it for decades.</p>
<p>In Minneapolis, a multiracial coalition feels targeted by their government, an experience of vulnerability caused by state violence and a reality for many people of color. Now, all Minneapolitans are learning the survival strategies of these communities.</p>
<p>Minneapolis has reacted to Operation Metro Surge with mutual aid similar to a natural disaster response. Minneapolis small businesses, including coffee shops, breweries and <a href="https://minnesotareformer.com/2026/01/23/8-weeks-under-siege-in-minnesota/">sex shops</a>, have facilitated 30,000-pound food drives for immigrants, provided free drinks to ICE observers, and organized ICE watchers.</p>
<p>Local big businesses were <a href="https://minnesotareformer.com/2026/01/16/big-minnesota-companies-keep-quiet-as-trumps-immigration-crackdown-squeezes-the-state/">nearly silent</a> until after the <a href="https://minnesotareformer.com/2026/01/24/another-minnesotan-shot-and-killed-by-feds/">killing of Alex Pretti</a> on January 24. A group of Minnesota CEOs subsequently wrote a <a href="https://minnesotareformer.com/2026/01/25/fallout-from-alex-pretti-killing-trump-administration-facing-widespread-criticism/">mild letter</a> asking all parties to de-escalate, but later offered $3.5 million in grants to vulnerable small businesses. Ordinary Minnesotans have set the example.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands attended the <a href="https://minnesotareformer.com/2026/01/23/thousands-expected-in-minneapolis-for-ice-out-day/">January 23rd ICE Out of MN march</a>, and 700 Minnesota businesses <a href="https://minnesotareformer.com/briefs/fridays-ice-out-of-minnesota-day-is-a-general-strike-heres-what-that-means/">closed in solidarity</a>. Restaurant patrons have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kq01MXq9vnU">provided free labor</a> after employees were too scared to leave their homes, and volunteers guard minority-owned businesses. By documenting ICE, observers are limiting their ability to commit unjustified violence without consequence, making it a protective and popular example of mutual aid.</p>
<p>According to UNIDOS, more than 26,000 people have been trained by their legal observers Monarca project. Minneapolis residents regularly film ICE agents entering their neighborhoods. Whistles are easy to spot on sidewalks and intersections, with one bar distributing 1,500 of them in recent weeks. <a href="https://minnesotareformer.com/2026/01/21/in-the-twin-cities-ice-resistance-goes-mainstream/">Observing ICE raids</a> ensures the right to due process regardless of criminal allegations, a policy with <a href="https://calmatters.org/justice/2025/12/immigration-poll-criminal-record/#:~:text=It%20showed%2084%25%20of%20Democrats,a%20judge%20before%20being%20deported.%E2%80%9D">bipartisan support</a>.</p>
<p>Many Minnesotans are investing in their communities in response to Donald Trump’s presidency. Anecdotally, this is happening elsewhere, as evidenced by reports of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/04/nyregion/mamdani-young-voters.html">social connections</a> formed through political and community participation.</p>
<p>Broader media coverage may not reflect the casual bonds and caregiving connecting the Resistance.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.uh.edu/news-events/stories/2020/june-2020/06242020-examining-media-coverage-of-protests.php">media emphasize</a> dramatic events associated with movements, and legacy news organizations have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jun/13/why-is-the-media-ignoring-growing-resistance-to-trump">at times underreported</a> grassroots responses to Donald Trump’s policies. Moreover, as local news outlets decline, social media is the most popular source of news in America — a platform notorious for pushing controversial content.</p>
<p>Gaps in coverage inflate the Trump administration’s power, while an underrecognized social movement strengthens democracy and mitigates the loneliness epidemic. Authoritarianism thrives on loneliness, but mutual aid creates connection and autonomy.</p>
<p>This movement is animating Minneapolis — and Americans should adopt it as their own.</p>
