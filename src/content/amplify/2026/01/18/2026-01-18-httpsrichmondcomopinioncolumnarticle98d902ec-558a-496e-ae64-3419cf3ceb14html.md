  The agreement UVa signed with its new president functions as a poison pill: it
  converts any effort to unwind a contested appointment into a costly and
  legally fraught undertaking, these columnists argue. If constitutional defects
  are ultimately established, the scandal will not be only that an improperly
  constituted board hired a president. The deeper scandal will be that the board
  wrote a contract making it financially prohibitive for a properly constituted
  successor to correct the error. A legitimate governing board should be able to
  repair illegitimate actions without paying an eight-figure penalty for the
  privilege. This contract ensures it cannot. That is not an accident of sloppy
  drafting. It is governance designed to insulate itself from accountability.

<p>The University of Virginia Board of Visitors did not merely appoint Scott Beardsley as president under constitutionally <a href="https://augustafreepress.com/news/vanishing-act-how-uvas-presidential-search-missed-what-took-us-an-hour-to-find/">questionable circumstances</a>. It locked in that appointment with a contract structured to make reversal economically prohibitive for any properly constituted successor board.</p>
