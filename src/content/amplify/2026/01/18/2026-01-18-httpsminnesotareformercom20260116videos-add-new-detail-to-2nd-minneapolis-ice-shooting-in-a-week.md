<p>Two videos add new details to what happened before and after an immigration agent shot a man in the leg in the Hawthorne neighborhood in north Minneapolis Wednesday night.</p>
<p>One video, a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/61554100184851/videos/1644686140245202/">livestream</a> of a 911 call from inside the house, includes a woman saying that the immigration agent shot the man, who she said is her husband, as he was entering the house. The livestream also shows at least one child present in the house.</p>
<p>Another video, taken by a north Minneapolis resident from across the street and shared with the <i>Reformer,</i> shows federal agents <a href="https://youtu.be/ySxGOCcH5Dk?si=fqSHVcDu-rfMI7lU&amp;t=174">firing numerous times</a> into the house, breaking a second-floor window.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said in an email to the <i>Reformer</i> on Friday that the agents had fired tear gas, not live rounds.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://minnesotareformer.com/2026/01/14/second-person-in-a-week-shot-by-federal-immigration-agent-in-minneapolis/">incident</a> began on Interstate 94, where federal agents were trying to apprehend a man, federal law enforcement and Minneapolis police said. The man drove toward a house on the 600 block of 24th Avenue North in north Minneapolis, where he wrecked the car outside the house and ran towards the house, federal and local law enforcement said.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said in a statement Thursday that the man who was shot is Julio Cesar Sosa-Celis, an undocumented Venezuelan national, and that he “began to resist and violently assault the officer.”</p>
<p>“While Sosa-Celis and law enforcement were in a struggle on the ground, two subjects came out of a nearby apartment and attacked the law enforcement officer with a snow shovel and broom handle,” the official federal statement said. The statement goes on to say that Sosa-Celis then began striking an officer with a shovel or broom stick.</p>

<p>According to the DHS statement, the officer, fearing for his life and safety, then “fired a defensive shot to defend his life,” after which the three men ran into the house.</p>
<p>Federal immigration agents arrested all three men, the statement said, and Sosa-Celis and the officer who shot him were at the hospital when the statement was published.</p>
<p>The <i>Washington Post </i><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2026/01/16/ice-shooting-victim-minneapolis-family/">interviewed</a> Sosa-Celis’s mother, Alicia Celis, who said her son told her that the man who was pursued by federal agents was actually Sosa-Celis’s friend, one of the three men arrested.</p>
<h4>Facebook livestream of 911 call and observer video</h4>
<p>According to Celis, Sosa-Celis opened the door to let his friend inside, and as Sosa-Celis went to close the door, an ICE officer shot him in the leg, reported the <i>Post</i>.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.facebook.com/61554100184851/videos/1644686140245202/">Facebook livestream video</a>, which appears to show the moments after the man was shot from the perspective of his wife and other people inside the house, partly lines up with Sosa-Celis’s account. The video was published by an account by the name of Lachamaka Mendoza and is timestamped to Wednesday 6:51 p.m., the exact time Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara said local police started receiving 911 calls about the shooting.</p>
<p>The <i>Reformer</i> has requested records of the 911 calls made after the shooting to further verify the video.</p>
<p>In the video, at least five people, including one small child, are in a house while law enforcement lights flash outside. They speak on the phone in Spanish to what sounds like a 911 operator, saying that someone has been shot in the leg by “guys from ICE.”</p>
<p>“Please help, we have kids,” one person said.</p>
<p>A woman then tells the operator: “It was ICE, they were chasing my husband for like half an hour and they were trying to crash into him. He got to the house and as we were closing the door they shot him.”</p>
<p>Another woman adds: “Tell them that they shot the door.” It is not clear from the video whether she meant that the agents shot through the doorway or at a door.</p>
<p>The 911 call suggests that the agent shot at the man as he was trying to escape into the house, which would contradict the Department of Homeland Security account that the federal immigration agent fired a shot defensively.</p>

<p>A separate video taken by a north Minneapolis resident starts around 7:26 p.m. and shows the vantage from across 24th Avenue North.</p>
<p>In that video, over a dozen agents surround the house. At minute <a href="https://youtu.be/ySxGOCcH5Dk?si=fqSHVcDu-rfMI7lU&amp;t=174">2:55 in the video</a>, the agents fire what DHS said was tear gas into the house, shattering the second floor window; at least three more shots are heard later.</p>
<p>At around 5 minutes into the video, federal agents enter the house. One observer yells that there are children in the house. Around <a href="https://youtu.be/ySxGOCcH5Dk?si=Wbo2qnw6pf3KCI8A&amp;t=1003">16 minutes into the video</a>, a woman who appears to be wearing a pink shirt exits the house — the Facebook livestream video also included a woman with a pink shirt.</p>
<p>“This is something I would have never expected to see in my life,” said the man who took the video and was granted anonymity by the <i>Reformer.</i> “It’s still hard for me to believe that this is actually happening in my city, so close to my home.”</p>
<h4>The BCA’s independent investigation</h4>
<p>The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, the state agency that investigates law enforcement shootings, was on the scene Wednesday night along with FBI agents to process evidence.</p>
<p>Also present at the scene were Minnesota State Patrol and Hennepin County sheriff’s deputies, which O’Hara said were there to help control the crowd of over 100 protestors and observers who had gathered, as well as Federal Bureau of Prisons officers.</p>
<p>The BCA said in an X post Wednesday night that it is investigating the shooting in an independent investigation.</p>
<p>The shooting comes one week after the killing of Renee Good by federal immigration officer Jonathan Ross in south Minneapolis touched off a wave of protests. In the immediate aftermath of the killing of Renee Good, the Trump administration said she was attempting to run over the ICE officer and kill him. But<a href="https://minnesotareformer.com/2026/01/07/ice-officer-fatally-shoots-driver-through-car-window-in-minneapolis/"> bystander footage</a> shows a chaotic scene with the officer to the side of her car when he shoots her as she seemingly tries to flee.</p>
<p>All three men are from Venezuela and came to the U.S. in 2022 and 2023, according to the DHS statement. The statement describes two of the men as criminals, though the only listed offenses for Sosa-Celis are driving without a license and giving a false name to a law enforcement officer.</p>
<p>Minnesota court records show that a 24-year-old Julio Cesar Sosa Celis has been fined for speeding and driving without a license or proof of insurance.</p>
