<h3>Where and when is the trial happening?</h3>
<p>The five-week trial begins on Jan. 12 at the Supreme Court of British Columbia at 800 Smithe St. in <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/JgbDpFxnaexEa2WM7">downtown Vancouver</a>. The Narwhal’s editor-in-chief Carol Linnitt and photojournalist Amber Bracken are set to testify during the first week. Closing arguments are scheduled for April.</p>

<h3>What does this lawsuit aim to accomplish?</h3>
<p>This case aims to establish meaningful consequences for police when they interfere with the constitutional rights of journalists covering events in injunction zones, including both journalists’ liberty rights and the freedom of the press, as protected by Section 2(b) of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. We hope to clear a path for all journalists in Canada to do their work without risk of police interference.</p>
<p>The lawsuit seeks declarations from the court that Bracken’s liberty rights and The Narwhal and Bracken’s press freedom rights were unjustifiably breached. The Narwhal and Bracken are also suing for damages for Bracken’s wrongful arrest and detention and the interference with their constitutional rights.</p>
