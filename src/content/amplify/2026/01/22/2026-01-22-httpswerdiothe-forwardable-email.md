  "A way to help others actually make that connection they said they would."
  I've used this for a decade, and it's probably useful for you, too.

title: The Forwardable Email

<p>[<a href="https://pointc.co/the-forwardable-email/?ref=the-idea-bucket-newsletter">Corey Ford at Point C</a>]</p>
<p>I know I share posts from <a href="https://pointc.co/?ref=werd.io">Corey</a> very regularly, but it’s because I’ve been working with him in various ways for over a decade, and the things he suggests are often techniques I’ve used productively for a long time. This is another great one.</p>
<p>I insist on double opt-in introductions if I’m making a connection. That means I check in with the connectee first: do they actually want this connection? It’s a little slower, but it means connections are always consensual.</p>
<p>To be able do that really well, a forwardable email is the perfect tool. Here, the person who wants to be connected drafts an email designed to allow me to forward it to the connectee with a little bit of added context. It gives them what they need to make an informed decision.</p>
<p>Corey’s template is actionable and really works: it’s what I’ve done for a decade now. It’s simple, but the underlying structure is not what most people are doing.</p>
<p>Honestly, I’m also just very happy that this is in a post on Corey’s site, because now when I tell people to write me a forwardable email, I can just point them to this. Please, if you’re asking me for a connection, this is the template I would like you to follow.</p>
