<p><b>The group chat allegedly shows NH House Education Committee Chair Kristin Noble suggesting test scores would rise if students were split into white and non-white schools. </b></p>
<p>A leaked group chat — seemingly used by Republican members of the New Hampshire House Education Committee — appears to show the committee’s chair, State Rep. Kristin Noble, suggesting that public schools would have varying test scores if New Hampshire separated students into different schools for white and non-white children.</p>
<p>In the “EdPolicy2026” chat on an encrypted messaging app that appears to be Signal, a username bearing Noble’s first and last name wrote that Republicans could add “fun stuff” to public schools “when we have segregated schools”</p>
<p>The user then added: “imagine the scores though if we had schools for them and some for us.”</p>
<p>A chat user bearing the name of State Rep. Katy Peternel — a State Representative and Assistant Majority Leader — reacted to Noble’s message with a laughing emoji (😂), according to a video recording of the chat provided by a source familiar with the chat’s contents who wished to remain anonymous. The Granite Post reached out to the alleged leaker, a fellow member of the education committee, who did not confirm they were the original source of the leak, but also did not deny its authenticity.</p>
<p>The screen recording of the messages appears to show multiple participants in the chat, consisting of Republican lawmakers involved at the highest levels of education policy in the state.</p>
<p>A recording of a portion of the leaked chat is <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CgjpVewdPp4MM3jAcNGJXlToAZCY-2td/view?usp=sharing">available here.</a></p>
<p>The Granite Post contacted Noble and Peternel and reached out to every Republican member of the House Education Committee that appeared in the chat for comment. None responded to media requests by the time of publication.</p>
<p>In the chat, the user labeled Kristin Noble is seen asking members of the chat, dubbed “EdPolicy2026” to “imagine the scores though if we had schools for them and some for us”.</p>
<p>The “them” in this case would refer to non-white students, and “scores” as test scores, suggesting one of the state’s chief education leaders would prefer New Hampshire schools be divided by race.</p>
<p>User Katy Peternel is seen laugh reacting with an emoji (😂) in chat to the message calling to segregate the public schools.</p>
<p>Both Noble and Peternel are members of leadership in the House Republican caucus. Democrats on the committee said the comments are beyond inappropriate.</p>
<p>“More than shocking. It’s disgusting,” said Democratic State Rep. David Luneau, ranking member on the House Education Funding Committee.</p>
<p>“It’s not who we are as a state. It’s not who we are as a country. And we’re better because we go to schools together and because we learn together and we work together, because… that’s how life is.”</p>
<p>Noble is a sponsor of <a href="https://gc.nh.gov/bill_status/legacy/bs2016/bill_status.aspx?lsr=2440&amp;sy=2026&amp;sortoption=&amp;txtsessionyear=2026&amp;txtbillnumber=HB1792">HB 1792</a>, a 2026 bill that would prohibit state school districts and school personnel from teaching “critical race theory” (CRT) while creating a path for students and parents to bring lawsuits against public schools or school districts for monetary damages.</p>
<p>A similar “divisive concepts” bill from 2021 was struck down by a federal judge for being unconstitutionally vague. Many opponents described that bill’s intent as being overtly racist in its attempts to silence discussions of race in New Hampshire classrooms.</p>
<p>Many civil-rights advocates and scholars argue that bills banning CRT often function in racially-discriminatory ways designed to hamper teaching about students about slavery, redlining, and segregation, because educators fear the potential for lawsuits and scandal.</p>
<p>Two of the five sponsors of HB 1792 — <a href="https://newhampshirebulletin.com/2022/09/01/nh-house-majority-leader-used-racial-slur-on-online-forum-resurfaced-post-shows/">House Majority Leader Jason Osborne</a> and <a href="https://granitepostnews.com/2025/05/30/nh-gop-lawmaker-blames-all-gun-violence-on-african-americans-in-shocking-email/">Rep. Travis Corcoran</a> — have been the subject of reporting on their use of racial slurs in publications across New Hampshire, with Osborne having used the slurs</p>
<p>This incident is not the first controversial group chat leaked. There have been a number of racially-motivated education policy proposals and overtly racist comments made by New Hampshire House Republicans.</p>
<p><a href="https://granitepostnews.com/2025/05/12/leaked-chats-appear-to-show-nh-gop-lawmaker-urging-violence-against-dissenting-republicans/">A leaked group chat </a>used by top House Republicans from April of 2025 showed prominent New Hampshire conservative members encouraging the use of violence against fellow Republicans for voting against the direction of leadership.</p>
<p>The US maintained racial separation by law from slavery in the 1600s through the Civil War in 1865 and then through Jim Crow segregation from the late 1800s (cemented by Plessy v. Ferguson in 1896). It was formally dismantled in the mid-20th century (Brown v. Board of Education in 1954 and federal bans in the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Fair Housing Act of 1968)</p>
<p>New Hampshire’s history of school segregation goes back to the 1800s.</p>
<p>In 19th-century New Hampshire, schooling was not consistently integrated — Black children and Indigenous children were not allowed to attend “common schools” with white children, and separate schooling sometimes existed.</p>
<p>One of the best-documented flash points came in Canaan in 1835. With the so-called Moose on the Loose, an integrated school named Noyes Academy opened, and supporters of segregation showed up to the school “with oxen and chains” and dragged the building away, leaving it a <a href="https://www.canaannh.gov/243/Noyes-Academy">“splintered heap.”</a></p>

<p>Katy Peternel (1:49 PM)</p>
<p>I’m sending him a message now.</p>
<p>Kristin Noble (1:50 PM)</p>
<p>all extra requirements aren’t helpful right now. Stopping woke mind virus stuff is good.</p>
<p>Katy Peternel (51m)</p>
<p>Are any of you supportive of the hunting bill?</p>
<p>Kristin Noble (47m)</p>
<p>i support it. it’s just not a priority.</p>
<p>Melissa Litchfield (46m)</p>
<p>No, not the way schools are run right now. I do not want to risk kids being taught that guns are bad.</p>
<p>Reactions shown: 💯 👍</p>
<p>Katy Peternel (46m)</p>
<p>If it wasn’t already allowed and Prospect Mountain wasn’t already teaching hunters safety, I might consider supporting it. Roy has his Eddie Eagle bill.</p>
<p><b>Kristin Noble (44m)</b></p>
<p><b>when we have segregated schools we can add all the fun stuff lol</b></p>
<p><i>Reaction shown from Rep.Katy Peternel: </i>😂</p>
<p><b>Kristin Noble (43m)</b></p>
<p><b>imagine the scores though if we had schools for them and some for us</b></p>
<p>Margaret Drye (20m)</p>
<p>I think the only bill I have in our committee is about the definition of part-time teachers.</p>
<p>Melissa Litchfield (6m) — replying to:</p>
<p>“Margaret Drye: I think the only bill I have in our committee is about the definition…”</p>
<p>It would be faster if we just ask Glenn how many bills I submitted!</p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to read our work. Before you go, we hope you'll consider supporting our values-driven journalism, which has always strived to make clear what's really at stake for New Hampshirites and our future.</p>
<p>Since day one, our goal here at Granite Post has always been to empower people across the state with fact-based news and information.
