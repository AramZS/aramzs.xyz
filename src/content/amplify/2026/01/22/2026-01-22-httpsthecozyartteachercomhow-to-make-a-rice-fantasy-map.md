<p>Call me a grouchy old lady, but I have never been a big fan of TikTok as a platform. That being said, I recently discovered the art trend of rice fantasy maps. As a lifelong fantasy nerd, I have become <strong>obsessed</strong>.</p>

<p>In this art trend, you pour rice over a sheet of drawing or watercolor paper and arrange it to look like a big plot of land. Then you outline the rice edges to create the shape of your map. Finally, you use an ink pen and add locations and details to your map to bring it to life.</p>
<p>I created a few at home on my own and it was so much fun I had to bring it into my art classes.</p>

<p>This is a fabulous project for making connections to other subjects, specifically <strong>geography</strong>. You can discuss different types of terrain with your students as well as the art of cartography.</p>
<p>I like to show them some of my personal favorite fantasy maps as well such as Hyrule from Legend of Zelda, Middle Earth from Lord of the Rings, Narnia, Westeros from Game of Thrones and much more.</p>
<p>You can also turn this into a project that focuses heavily on value and linework. We used a lot of pen and ink techniques such as hatching, cross-hatching, stippling, scumbling, etc.</p>
<p>My students already practiced these techniques prior but if your students have not, I highly recommend spending a day or so doing just that with them.</p>
<p>Here is the pen and ink worksheet I like to practice with my own students.</p>

<ul><li><strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Great-Value-Long-Grain-Enriched-Rice-5-lbs/10315395?athbdg=L1600">Multiple bags of rice</a></strong><br/>Get several bags! I underestimated just how much rice was needed for this project. My classroom has group tables of 6 students each and I ended up giving each table 2 bags. Luckily, rice is super cheap at the grocery store.<br/></li><li><a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Great-Value-French-Roast-100-Arabica-Dark-Roast-Ground-Coffee-12-oz/861275001?athbdg=L1600&amp;from=/search"><strong>Dark roast coffee</strong><br/></a>I used a breakfast roast in my classroom and I really wish I used dark instead. My students had to add multiple layers of coffee because it was just too light. Dark roast will show up a lot better and go a longer way!<br/></li><li><strong>Paint brushes<br/></strong></li><li><strong>Watercolor Paper (no smaller than 12 x 18)</strong><br/>This is really difficult for students if your watercolor paper is small like 9×12.. I gave my Art 1 students 12 x 18 and my Art 2 students 18 x 24 for them to expand.<br/></li><li><strong>Sharpie pens </strong>(fine and ultrafine)</li></ul>
<p>The first thing students do is to paint their paper with a layer of coffee to stain it. This will give them a nice base tone to work with. I have a Keurig in my room, brewed a few cups of coffee and brought them to each table. If you have access to a drip coffee maker you can brew an entire pot and save you time in that department.</p>

<p>The paper will definitely curl up when they start painting their coffee but once it dries it will be able to flatten out easily!</p>
<p>Now the fun part…….</p>
<p>After the coffee stain is dry, pour out the rice, arrange in a fun shape and trace the outlines.</p>
<p>This project requires a lot of planning ahead but this was the part my students had a lot of fun with!</p>

<p>They were required to come up with a name for their fantasy land as well as six different locations to include on their map. A lot of students picked a theme for their fantasy land to help keep everything cohesive (ex. Halloween, celestial themed, fall themed, floral themed, etc.</p>
<p>I made several handouts in Canva for students to use.</p>
<p>The first set of handouts is a locations planning sheet where they had to sketch out and name all of their locations. I also gave them a few handouts with a lot of visual examples of mountains, trees, caves, castles, lighthouses, pirate ships, tents and buildings to give them visual inspiration.</p>
<p>We spent a few days planning out and sketching all of our locations on our plan sheet. Everybody had to turn in their planning sheets to me to approve before they moved onto the next step.</p>
<p>I instructed them to choose places for their locations and draw them first. Once they did that and had everything where they wanted it, they filled in all the gaps with land items such as mountains, rivers, trees, lakes, etc.</p>
<p>They were also required to include line techniques to give their maps more detail. We outlined and added all those back with an ultra-fine sharpie.</p>
<p>Don´t forget to add the title to your fantasy land somewhere! I gave my students a handout with a bunch of medieval/fantasy letter styles with paper scrolls to look at for reference.</p>
<p>Finally…. Go back and add another layer of coffee AROUND the island to create contrast and make everything stand out.</p>
<p><strong>Want to be even *extra*? </strong>Let your students tear the edges of their map to give it a more antique look. Some of them even wanted to burn the edges, but I was too chicken to let them do so at school. I told them they would need to do it at home if they wanted.</p>
<p>Want to add an extra layer to this project? Make it a cross-curricular lesson and incorporate creative writing by having them write a paragraph about the history of their fantasy land! I didn’t have enough time to do that this year, but I will definitely do it in the future.</p>

<p>This turned out being one of my students’ FAVORITE projects this year. They kept asking if I was done grading them so they could take them home!</p>
