<h4>11:22 a.m.</h4>
<p>Wednesday’s shooting happened a day after the Department of Homeland Security announced that “the largest DHS operation ever is happening right now in Minnesota.”</p>
<p>The agency <a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2026/01/06/noem-twin-cities-federal-immigration-crackdown-continues">said it was deploying 2,000 law enforcement officers</a> to the Twin Cities — an escalation of an immigration crackdown that started more than a month earlier.</p>
<p>MPR News contacted both DHS and Immigration and Customs Enforcement on Tuesday to confirm the number of agents being deployed to Minnesota. DHS responded with a statement from Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin, saying, “While for the safety of our officers we do not get into law enforcement footprint, DHS has surged law enforcement and has already made more than 1,000 arrests of murderers, rapists, pedophiles and gang members.”</p>
<p>Amid the reported surge of federal agents, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was in the Twin Cities on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Gov. Tim Walz on Tuesday had sharply criticized the federal enforcement effort, raising concerns about both the scale of the operation and the lack of coordination with state officials.</p>
<p>Minneapolis council member Robin Wonsley <a href="https://x.com/MplsWard2/status/2008943560813375524?s=20">posted on social media</a> she is on the ground with other council members. The City of Minneapolis <a href="https://x.com/CityMinneapolis/status/2008949283916030213?s=20">X account shared</a> that Mayor Jacob Frey is “demanding ICE to leave the city and state immediately.”</p>

<p>A witness to Wednesday’s shooting in south Minneapolis told MPR News that she saw a federal agent shoot a woman several times.</p>
<p>Emily Heller lives near 33rd and Portland and said she woke up to a commotion outside her home. She said she saw a car blocking traffic on Portland Avenue that appeared to be part of a protest against federal law enforcement operations.</p>
<p>Heller said she heard ICE agents telling the driver, a woman, to “get out of here.”</p>
<p>“She was trying to turn around, and the ICE agent was in front of her car, and he pulled out a gun and put it right in — like, his midriff was on her bumper — and he reached across the hood of the car and shot her in the face like three, four times,” Heller said.</p>
<p>Heller said it appeared the woman then accelerated and traveled about 100 feet before striking a utility pole and some other vehicles. She could be seen slumped over inside her car.</p>
<p>Gov. Tim Walz <a href="https://x.com/govtimwalz/status/2008943209091879005?s=46">said his public safety team is aware of an ICE-related shooting</a> and will share information as they learn more.</p>
<p>“In the meantime, I ask folks to remain calm,” Walz said in the post.</p>
<p>Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey <a href="https://x.com/mayorfrey/status/2008945355925364762?s=46&amp;t=eV-sg5ghs-kyfti1hIY8xQ">also confirmed</a> the shooting involved an ICE agent.</p>
<p>“The presence of federal immigration enforcement agents is causing chaos in our city,” Frey said in the post. “We’re demanding ICE to leave the city immediately. We stand rock solid with our immigrant and refugee communities.”</p>
<p>Witnesses reported a person was shot in south Minneapolis on Wednesday morning, amid a large presence of federal law enforcement officers.</p>
<p>It was not immediately clear who may have been shot, or who may have fired the gunshots.</p>
<p>A witness told an MPR News journalist at the scene near East 34th Street and Portland Avenue that they saw CPR being performed on someone who was injured. That person was taken away in an ambulance.</p>
