<h3> Paul Bannister </h3>
<p>For years, there was an iron law in digital advertising that every publisher understood: ad density and revenue moved in lockstep. Want to make more money? Add more ads. Need to cut ad density by 10%? Prepare to lose roughly the same percent of your revenue. The math was brutal and predictable. </p>
<p>That law has been broken.</p>
<p>At Raptive, we've been running controlled experiments on ad density across our network, and what we're finding should matter to every media buyer reading this: the market is maturing to reward quality over quantity. And that's great news for everyone—ad buyers, publishers, and the users we all ultimately serve.</p>
<p>Two years ago, if we pulled ads from a page, we simply made less money. CPMs didn't rise to compensate. Buyers weren't distinguishing between a page stuffed with inventory and one with a more considered approach. To many publishers, impressions were impressions, and more impressions meant more revenue.</p>
<p>This wasn't because buyers wanted these experiences; it's that the information they had to target ads wasn't sufficient to make the best choice. And it wasn't because publishers wanted these experiences; they simply didn't have the data to determine which changes they made were revenue-positive in the longer term. </p>
<p>A New Approach to A/B Testing</p>
<p>For years, we've been developing the most advanced A/B testing platform for web advertising. Our systems compare every single change we make to our ad stack and the performance of every single partner against a control group. This is all done in real-time, allowing us to quickly gauge the performance of changes and identify any existing issues in our ad stack that need to be addressed.</p>
<p>Everything is based on incrementality. Not "does this change make money," but "does this change make more money than if we didn't do it?" This gives us a great ability to maximize revenue.</p>
<p>But our systems were missing a key element. All of our historic A/B testing examines what is happening right now. However, some changes can take a long amount of time to filter through ad buying systems, particularly those related to ad performance, as buyers often don't quickly know whether an ad has driven a conversion or other ROAS-related measure.</p>
<p>In 2025, we expanded our A/B testing to include longer-term impact assessments through cohort testing. Our cohort testing involves comparing groups of sites with significant ad inventory against similar groups. This way, the test and control groups are sites, not just randomized pools of inventory. Then we can make changes to one group of sites, but not to the other group. And we can let those tests run for weeks or months. </p>
<p>Ad Density Testing</p>
<p>This enabled us to test new ad density and ad format configurations to really understand whether the changes we were making would actually drive increased performance over time. And the results exceeded our expectations. </p>
<p>On mobile web, we found that we could reduce content ad density by 16% and offset that decrease in impressions with an increase in CPM. On desktop, we found similar results. For years, I have said, "If we can have fewer ads and make the same money, that's a huge win." And now we can. And in some cases, even make more money by removing ads. That's unprecedented and shows that the old math is indeed dead.</p>
<p>We've rolled out those density adjustments as our standard, and now we're working on additional tests to further reduce ad density, simplify ad layouts, and focus on ad formats that are effective versus those that are not.</p>
<p>The Signal in the Noise</p>
<p>Here's what I hope media buyers take away from this: your data is working.</p>
<p>For this math to hold—for CPMs to rise as density falls—buyers need to continue making increasingly informed decisions at the impression level. Bidding algorithms have to recognize that an ad on a less cluttered page is more likely to be seen, more likely to be engaged with, and more likely to drive outcomes. The fact that the market is now pricing that in means the signal is cutting through. Hope is being replaced by data. This is what we need. </p>
<p>This is the virtuous cycle our industry has talked about for years, but never achieved. Publishers who make better decisions for user experience are starting to see financial reward for those choices. That creates incentives for more publishers to follow suit. This creates a flywheel that can make the open internet a better place for all.</p>
<p>The publishers worth investing in aren't necessarily the ones serving the most impressions — they're the ones whose impressions actually work. Attention and outcome data are becoming the arbiters of value, not just raw scale.</p>
<p>The Future</p>
<p>We're entering a phase where publisher quality is genuinely differentiating in the marketplace. For a long time, programmatic buying optimized for efficiency in ways that commoditized inventory, making it difficult for premium environments to justify their value. This is finally changing.</p>
<p>Much remains to be done. We're discussing with the major DSPs the opportunity to tie actual media outcomes to page experience and ad density, thereby accelerating the feedback loops and iterating towards a better user experience more quickly. We also have a unique advantage: the largest quantity of large-scale, high-quality sites, and the most data about supply-side economics by far. As we learn more about what works, we will share that information with the broader ecosystem, allowing other premium publishers to benefit from these insights. </p>
<p>I've been in digital media long enough to be skeptical of "win-win" narratives. The economics usually force trade-offs. But what we're seeing now feels genuinely different.</p>
<p>When publishers can serve fewer ads while maintaining revenue, users receive a better experience. When buyers can pay more per impression and get better outcomes, budgets expand to drive those outcomes. When quality is rewarded, the whole ecosystem improves. We're not fully there yet, but the direction is right. The data is flowing. The incentives are starting to align.</p>
<p>At Raptive, we will continue to test, publish what we learn, and advocate for a model where better choices lead to better outcomes. The old iron law is dead. What replaces it is up to all of us.</p>
