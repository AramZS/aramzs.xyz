<details> <p>Our review includes documents put forward between January 2022 and June 2025. While regulations and strategies on AI existed prior to this period, they were excluded because they pre-date the widespread public release of generative AI systems, occasioned by ChatGPT’s launch in November 2022, and therefore do not reflect subsequent policy shifts.</p> <p>Out of necessity, our sampling approach varied by region and by country. In North America, especially the U.S., there were too many bills to take a comprehensive approach. In this case, we selected AI legislation that represented a range of approaches, and prioritized regional/state diversity rather than likelihood to pass, consistent with our goal of understanding the breadth of regulatory approaches. </p> <p>In other regions, such as Europe and Central Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East and North Africa, South Asia, and East Asia and the Pacific, we were able to compile a near-complete list of relevant documents from each individual country’s legislative resources and review the majority of bills and strategies. For countries with more than 50 bills at the national level, such as Mexico, we prioritized comprehensive bills over those that sought to create committees or institutes, amend current laws or address highly specific issues. In all these cases, secondary sources (e.g., law firms, academic articles) were used to verify the status of various proposals in the legislative process. </p> <p>In Europe, we did not review individual strategies or laws for European Union member states since they automatically fall under the EU AI Act. EU candidate states are also required to pass legislation that aligns with the EU AI Act, so we noted when candidate states had separate strategies or policies in place. </p> <p>In cases where a country had a bill, strategy and/or policy, we prioritized the legally-binding bill(s) over non-binding strategy documents. We did not count white papers or other government-sponsored research papers in the 188 documents we reviewed, but these papers were sometimes used to assess impacts on journalism. </p> <p>Wherever possible, we reviewed bills, strategies and proposals in their original language. In addition to English, our research team includes members proficient in Spanish, French and Portuguese. For many other languages, we used high-quality English translations provided by law firms, research groups or governments themselves. For some documents, especially those from East Asia, we used machine translation. In these cases, our understanding was supplemented and confirmed by secondary sources (which are cited wherever appropriate). All machine translated quotes in this report have been confirmed by a human translator.</p> <p>We focused on documents that used the term “artificial intelligence,” but definitions were not always consistent across laws or policies, even within a single country. (Many policies we included also used additional AI-related terms like “deepfakes.”)</p> <p>As with all CNTI research, this report was prepared by the research and professional staff of CNTI. </p> </details>

<p>One challenge is that as the number of AI developers proliferates (potentially including news organizations with sufficient resources), regulatory oversight needs can quickly balloon — a factor regulators would need to similarly prepare for in advance.</p>
<p>While audits and transparency requirements would not be a foolproof solution to addressing potential societal harms or inequalities tied to AI — including harms to journalism and the information space — they could help prevent or minimize them. They could also make it easier for journalists to report on potential bias as journalists currently rely on time- and labor-intensive <a href="https://gijn.org/resource/guide-investigating-social-media-algorithms/">reverse engineering</a>.</p>
