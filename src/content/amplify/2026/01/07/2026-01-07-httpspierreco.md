<h2>Stop wasting engineering time</h2>
<p>Product drift happens when ideas and teams get siloed—Product is in Notion, Design is in Figma, and Engineering is running between them. Bring everyone together where your source of truth is—in code—with one tool.</p>

<h2>Tailored for engineering teams building product</h2>
<p>Pierre reimagines decades old software tools just for product engineers and their teams. Our CLI effortlessly onboards you and your projects. A lightning fast UI keeps you flowing in realtime. And our scriptable CI lets you annotate code changes and surface artifacts and more in custom widgets.</p>
