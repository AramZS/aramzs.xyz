  ‘Whata Bod’: An AI-generated NWS map invented fake towns in Idaho - The
  Washington Post

<p>Amid a big agency push to use AI models in weather prediction, an AI-generated forecast graphic with errors was pulled from NWS sites.</p>
<p>At first glance, there was nothing out of the ordinary about Saturday’s wind forecast for Camas Prairie, Idaho.</p>
<p>“Hold onto your hats!” said a social media post from the local weather office in Missoula, Montana. “Orangeotild” had a 10 percent chance of high winds, while just south, “Whata Bod” would be spared larger gusts.</p>
