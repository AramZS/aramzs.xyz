<p>More people in the UK have watched <a data-testid="next-link-anchor" href="https://www.itv.com/news/topic/youtube">YouTube</a> than the <a data-testid="next-link-anchor" href="https://www.itv.com/news/topic/bbc">BBC </a>for the first time ever, according to new figures.</p>
<p>Data from the independent ratings body Barb shows the video platform reached 51.9 million viewers, compared with 50.9 million for the BBC across all its channels.</p>
<p>The Google-owned video platform also beat the BBC in November and October, when Barb started measuring its audience numbers.</p>
<p>The figures mark a decisive moment for the BBC, which has dominated Britain’s airwaves since it began television broadcasts nearly a century ago but is now facing a steady loss of viewers.</p>
<p>Traditional broadcasters have long been under pressure from well-funded US streaming services such as Netflix and Disney, which have attracted audiences by investing heavily in films and television.</p>
<p>However, industry executives increasingly see YouTube as the most immediate threat.</p>
<p>Launched more than 20 years ago, the platform has drawn viewers with a mix of short videos and longer, high-production content from creators such as MrBeast and British YouTuber Amelia Dimoldenberg, whose series Chicken Shop Date regularly attracts more than 10 million viewers and rivals television-quality programming.</p>
<p>The shift of viewers to rival platforms poses a particular challenge for the BBC as it enters talks with the government over the future of the TV licence fee.</p>
<p>The corporation lost more than £1 billion last year as people cancelled or avoided paying the charge, which is due to rise to £181 in April.</p>
<p>Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy has recognised the need for reform, with alternatives such as advertising and subscriptions for raising revenue under consideration.</p>
<p>The BBC has pushed back against the Barb figures, which count viewers who watch a service for at least three consecutive minutes across TVs, phones and other devices.</p>
<p>It argues this gives too much weight to short-form video and does not fairly reflect television viewing.</p>
<p>Instead, the broadcaster uses a 15-minute measure, which it said better captures engagement with long-form programmes.</p>
<p>On this basis, the BBC’s average monthly reach last year was 47 million, compared with 40.8 million for YouTube.</p>
<p>A BBC spokesperson told ITV News: “The UK watches significantly more BBC TV than that of any other provider. In 2025, UK audiences watched 351 million hours on the BBC each week, which is far ahead of anyone else.</p>

<p>"When we focus on reach, we look at a minimum of 15 minutes as an appropriate measure for longform content and by that measure the BBC continues to lead the way.”</p>
<p>Even so, the figures highlight the degree to which YouTube has reshaped the television industry.</p>
<p>Last summer, the BBC overtook ITV for the first time in viewing share.</p>
<p>In a warning to broadcasters, regulator Ofcom said the BBC and other public service channels must make more content for YouTube or risk losing relevance with younger audiences who are increasingly turning away from traditional TV.</p>
