<h1>Faculty firings over Kirk commentary are unraveling</h1>

<p><b>REINSTATED —</b> The fierce First Amendment clash between faculty and their colleges sparked by the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk is starting to tip in the educators’ favor.</p>
<p>More than 50 faculty were fired or faced discipline for writing or sharing social media posts critical of the Turning Point USA founder in the weeks after his death, according to the American Association of University Professors faculty union. The terminations and suspensions occurred after <a href="https://subscriber.politicopro.com/newsletter/2025/09/mcmahon-urges-educator-sanctions-over-kirk-social-posts-00570191">Trump administration officials and Republican lawmakers and governors</a> demanded universities take action over posts they claimed celebrated the activist’s death or could spur more violence.</p>
<p>But roughly four months later, several educators are heading back to work.</p>
<p>Austin Peay State University professor Darren Michael <a href="https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/2026/01/07/austin-peay-professor-clarksville-tn-fired-charlie-kirk-free-speech-social-media-settlement-lawsuit/88065303007/?gnt-cfr=1&amp;gca-cat=p&amp;gca-uir=true&amp;gca-epti=z114923p004350c004350d00----v114923d--53--b--53--&amp;gca-ft=147&amp;gca-ds=sophi">won a $500,000 settlement</a> after his institution fired him for his online post about Kirk. Clemson University rescinded its firing of assistant professor Joshua Bregy due to a settlement. University of South Dakota art professor Michael Hook was also reinstated after being placed on leave. And Fresno State lecturer Barri Brennan was reinstated after being placed on paid administrative leave.</p>
<p>But dozens of other faculty members are still fighting to overturn university decisions to suspend or terminate them over their Kirk-related social media comments.</p>
<p>“We’re certainly seeing the punishments for Kirk commentary die down,” said Zach Greenberg, faculty legal defense and student association counsel at the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, a free speech advocacy group. “The law is very clear. Public faculty members, like any other public employees, don’t surrender their First Amendment rights when they apply to work at a university.”</p>
<p>AAUP President Todd Wolfson also lauded the reinstatements. Wolfson, who is a professor at Rutgers University, said the court victories “tell us that … we have a right to say that Charlie Kirk said some disgusting things, and just because we’re faculty members doesn’t mean we don’t have the right to say those things.”</p>
<p>While universities have largely been in the spotlight, K-12 teachers have similarly faced threats of suspension and dismissals.</p>
<p>The Texas chapter of the American Federation of Teachers union filed a lawsuit earlier this month against Texas Education Agency investigations into educators. More than 350 teachers have faced probes in Texas because of an <a href="https://x.com/CameronSAbrams/status/1966616519862837444/photo/1">agency directive</a> referring teachers’ social media posts about Kirk to an investigations division that reviews reports of misconduct to determine if they should be disciplined.</p>
<p>Similar disciplinary actions and investigations into teachers have taken place <a href="https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/2025/09/florida-targets-teacher-certifications-over-online-kirk-comments-00575019">in Florida,</a> <a href="https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/2025/09/19/indiana-governor-threatens-licenses-of-who-teachers-celebrate-political-violence-online/">in Indiana</a>, <a href="https://oklahoma.gov/education/divisions/media/newsroom/2025/september/teacher-removal-and-districts-under-investigation-regarding-char.html">in Oklahoma</a>, <a href="https://www.whro.org/education-news/2025-10-06/virginia-educators-call-for-free-speech-protection-due-process-in-wake-of-discipline-following-kirk-shooting">in Virginia</a> and <a href="https://www.thegazette.com/k/iowa-teacher-could-be-fired-after-social-media-post-about-charlie-kirks-death/">in Iowa</a>.</p>
<p>TEA could not be reached for comment. But Texas Commissioner of Education Mike Morath, in a September letter, slammed the posts as “vile content” and said some posts could “constitute a violation of the Educators’ Code of Ethics.” And the agency’s probes happened with the <a href="https://x.com/GregAbbott_TX/status/1967686867689902503">support of Texas Gov. Greg Abbott</a>.</p>
<p>The AFT chapter argues the directive violates their members’ First Amendment rights. The directive restricts free speech and hampers their ability to openly discuss Kirk with students, Texas AFT President Zeph Capo said.</p>
<p>“A lot of our teachers got caught up in thinking that they had just as much First Amendment constitutional protection as any other U.S. citizen,” Capo said, adding that “never in a million years” did they imagine the “censorship” they are facing.</p>

<h2>Higher Ed </h2>
<p><b>WHERE ARE THE CAMPUS PROTESTERS?: </b>Even though teachers and other faculty members are pushing back, there are still broad concerns about how the fallout of the shooting combined with the Trump administration’s heightened scrutiny of college campuses could hamper free speech on campus. This comes as protests are breaking out over the <a href="https://www.startribune.com/ice-raids-minnesota/601546426">federal immigration crackdown and two fatal shootings in Minneapolis</a>.</p>
<p>Campus protests have not been very active in the last few weeks, which AAUP’s Wolfson and FIRE’s Greenberg attributed to weather conditions and the fact that students just arrived back on campus last week. And while students and faculty are pushing to organize, they have faced hurdles on their campuses.</p>
<p>After the Kirk shooting, there was an “increased drive for conservative groups to get organized and recognized, mostly through TPUSA chapters,” Greenberg said.</p>
<p>“We also see a lot of college Republican chapters having events, trying to get more funding, more recognition, and unfortunately, we’re seeing many universities crack down on that,” he said. “They’re requiring groups to put forth large security fees to have their events.”</p>
<p>Faculty have “been in fear of the political climate and their rights to speak,” Wolfson said. That includes speaking about the political subjects of the day, he said, in addition to how they teach subjects considered controversial. But “things are bubbling over so much” that Wolfson said he expects more protesters in coming weeks.</p>
<p>“We’re seeing protests and people in the streets, and I think that’s going to increase,” Wolfson said. “In this case, we’ll see faculty, students and staff, reflecting that back by also organizing on our campuses.”</p>
<h2>IN CONGRESS</h2>
<p><b>PREGNANT STUDENTS RIGHTS IN THE SENATE:</b> The Senate <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/23/senate-vote-shutdown-snow-00745282">canceled today’s planned votes</a> because of the winter storm. But the chamber is expected to take a <a href="https://x.com/SenateCloakroom/status/2014810018366013715?s=20">procedural vote on Tuesday</a> to consider <a href="https://legislation.politicopro.com/bill/US_119_S_3627">S. 3627</a>, the “Pregnant Students’ Rights Act,” introduced by Sen. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/468658">Ashley Moody</a> (R-Fla.). The measure is similar to <a href="https://legislation.politicopro.com/bill/US_119_HR_6359?q=H.r.+6359">H.R. 6359</a>, the “Pregnant Students’ Rights Act,” which <a href="https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/2026/01/house-passes-pregnant-students-rights-bill-00742642">passed the House last week.</a></p>
<p>The legislation would mandate that colleges advise pregnant students of their rights to modified class schedules and excused absences for doctors appointments. It also directs colleges to email students about those accommodations, campus and community resources to support their pregnancy, and how to report discrimination.</p>
<p>It’s not likely the measure will advance through the Senate procedural vote because it requires Democratic support. Democrats have strongly opposed the measure and criticized language in the bill that focused solely on supporting students to “carry a baby to term.” <a href="https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/202647">Only one Democrat</a> supported the bill in the House: Rep. Henry Cuellar of Texas.</p>
<h2>Movers and Shakers</h2>
<p><b>COLUMBIA’S NEW LEADER: </b>Columbia University tapped <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/25/nyregion/columbia-president-wisconsin-mnookin.html">University of Wisconsin-Madison Chancellor Jennifer Mnookin</a> to helm the institution after a lengthy search for a new leader for the embattled institution. Mnookin’s selection comes more than a year after <a data-debug-source-site="POLITICO Pro" data-debug-source-uuid="00000195-df62-dc25-a3b7-dffe3b690000" href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/28/columbia-interim-president-steps-down-00259153">former Columbia President Minouche Shafik resigned</a> after facing intense scrutiny over her response to the pro-Palestinian encampment protests that roiled the campus.</p>
<p>Mnookin will lead the institution after a tumultuous year between Columbia and the White House. The school was the first to have hundreds of millions in federal research dollars frozen by the Trump administration and was the <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/07/23/columbia-university-reaches-a-settlement-with-trump-administration-00473322">first to reach an unprecedented settlement</a> with the government to end federal civil rights probes into alleged antisemitism.</p>
<p>The deal has been widely criticized as a capitulation by one of the oldest and wealthiest institutions in the country to the federal government. Columbia agreed to pay $200 million over three years to the federal government to settle the investigations and another $21 million to settle probes conducted by the federal employment discrimination commission. The school also agreed to hire an independent monitor to oversee the resolution’s implementation.</p>
