<p>Microsoft has been found to have unlawfully placed tracking cookies on the devices of a child without their consent, following a complaint to the Austrian data protection authority.</p>
<p>The complaint, lodged by privacy rights group noyb back in June 2024, concerns the tech giant’s educational software platform, Microsoft 365 Education, which is used by millions of students and teachers in schools across Europe.</p>
<p>Following the decision, the Austrian data protection authority ordered Microsoft to stop the unlawful tracking within four weeks, according to noyb. The non-profit said that Microsoft’s own documentation states that the cookies it deploys analyse user behaviour, collect browser data and are used for advertising purposes.</p>
<p>Commenting in a statement, Felix Mikolasch, a data protection lawyer at noyb, said: “Tracking minors clearly isn’t privacy-friendly. It seems like Microsoft doesn’t care much about privacy, unless it is for their marketing and PR statements.”</p>
<p>The decision could have ramifications for all organisations using Microsoft’s software, noyb said.</p>
<p>Microsoft has been contacted for comment.</p>
<p>The decision follows an earlier one by the Austrian authority against Microsoft after noyb filed two complaints against Microsoft 365 Education simultaneously. Last October, the authority also found the company had violated the bloc’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) by infringing the right of access under Article 15.</p>
<p>This is also not the first time that Microsoft 365 has faced GDPR-related issues. In <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/news/eu-commission-breached-data-protection-rules-using-microsoft-365-eu-watchdog-found/">March 2024</a> the Commission’s data protection supervisor found the EU’s executive to be in breach of privacy rules applicable to EU bodies over its use of the tech giant’s software, and ordered corrective measures.</p>
<p>That enforcement action was closed <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/news/eus-privacy-supervisor-clears-commissions-use-of-microsoft/">last summer</a>, after the Commission updated its contracts with Microsoft.</p>
