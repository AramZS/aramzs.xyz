<p>The presentation sheds light on the ideology of one of the most influential figures in the United States given his role at the vanguard of Silicon Valley's <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2021/09/20/peter-thiel-book-facebook-trump-jd-vance-blake-masters-josh-hawley-513121">ideological shift</a> toward an ideology blending Christian conservatism with a radical libertarianism. Thiel was invited by philosopher and academy member Chantal Delsol.</p>
<p>According to the presentation notes seen by POLITICO, which had been translated into French, Thiel said the Antichrist is "not only a medieval fantasy" but that it and the apocalypse are both linked to "the end of modernity," which he has argued is currently happening.</p>
<p>Thiel said the Antichrist would exploit fears of the apocalypse — for example due to nuclear armageddeon, climate change or the threat posed by AI — to control a "frightened population." He listed, as he has on previous occasions, Swedish environmental activist Greta Thunberg as a possible example.</p>
<p>The 58-year-old self-described “classic liberal” and “moderate Orthodox Christian" had previously spoken about the Antichrist at an even<a href="https://acts17collective.org/the-antichrist-lecture-series"> in San Francisco last year</a> and also discussed his thoughts on it <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/26/opinion/peter-thiel-antichrist-ross-douthat.html">with The New York Times</a>. But he called the Academy of Moral and Political Sciences "one of the few places in the world where a conference like this can take place."</p>
<p>The two attendees previously cited told POLITICO they weren't exactly blown away with the talk. One called it "disjointed." The other said: "I heard more about the Antichrist during those 45 minutes than during the rest of my life."</p>
<p>"I didn't understand much," said a third attendee who did not specify what the talk was about.</p>
