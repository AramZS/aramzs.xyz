<p>Nine progressive prosecutors from cities around the country are launching a coalition to assist in prosecuting federal law enforcement officers who violate state laws, one of the prosecutors, Larry Krasner in Philadelphia, said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The organization, which is called the Project for the Fight Against Federal Overreach, will also include Mary Moriarty, the elected prosecutor in Minneapolis. Its acronym, F.A.F.O., references a slang term for negative consequences, and its formation was spurred by “growing concerns about warrantless entries, unlawful detentions, and coercive enforcement tactics by federal agents,” according to a news release.</p>
<p>The handling of potentially criminal actions by federal agents has become a major issue in Minneapolis after two protesters, both U.S. citizens, were killed there this month by Department of Homeland Security officers.</p>
<p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation said it would not investigate the first killing, of Renee Good, a 37-year-old mother of three. She was killed in her S.U.V. on Jan. 7 as she appeared to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/15/video/ice-shooting-renee-good-minneapolis-videos.html">be steering away</a> from federal agents during a tense confrontation. Trump administration officials said that the officer who shot Ms. Good had been under attack and was acting in self-defense, and state investigators have been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/25/us/federal-exclude-minnesota-shooting-investigations.html">blocked</a> from accessing evidence related to the episode.</p>
<p>After a second resident was killed — Alex Pretti, a Veteran Affairs nurse who was also 37 — federal officials initially appeared to use the same playbook. They blocked state investigators from the scene and declined to provide basic facts, like the identity of the agents involved. In both instances, bystander video contradicted key elements of the Trump administration’s account of what happened.</p>
<p>Facing a wave of criticism, President Trump on Tuesday promised a “very honorable and honest investigation” into Mr. Pretti’s death.</p>
