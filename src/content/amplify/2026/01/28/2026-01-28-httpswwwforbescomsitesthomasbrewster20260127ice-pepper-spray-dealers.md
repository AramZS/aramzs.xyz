title: The Men Making Millions Selling Pepper Spray To ICE
---
<div><div><p><abbr>In</abbr><strong> the moments before</strong> Border Patrol officers shot and killed ICU nurse Alex Pretti in Minneapolis last week, they pepper sprayed him in the face as he tried to protect a fellow protestor. Shocking photos have circulated showing how ICE agents have aggressively used the substance, which is considered a non-lethal chemical weapon, to control crowds protesting the Trump administration’s increasingly violent immigration crackdown. </p><p>Both pepper spray and tear gas can incapacitate people by causing searing burning pain and making it difficult to breathe. According to government contracting records, the government largely buys them from a small group of little known companies. Over the last year, these companies have signed deals for chemical weapons and equipment with ICE, and their largest ever contract with CBP, Border Patrol’s parent agency. </p><p>Quantico Tactical, a weapons and armor distributor based in Aberdeen, North Carolina, is by far the biggest supplier of chemical weapons to ICE and CBP during Trump’s second term, per contracting records. Founded by North Carolina-based David Hensley, a former Marine Corps major, it has sold $4.7 million of tear gas and pepper spray to the agencies since January 2025, nearly triple its $1.7 million in sales the previous year. It has also provided more traditional munitions to ICE; its biggest contract with the agency was for $10 million in “firearms and magazines” in September last year.</p><p>As a distributor, Quantico doesn’t manufacture any equipment it sells; it resells others’ products. Though the public contracts don’t provide the name of the manufacturer, Quantico is a major reseller of equipment from Safariland, one of the best-known providers of chemical non-lethal weapons to federal agencies.</p><hr/><p><sup><strong>Got a tip on immigration agencies’ use of surveillance tech or weaponry?</strong> Contact the reporter, Thomas Brewster, at tbrewster@forbes.com or +1 929-512-7964 on Signal.</sup></p><hr/><p>As <a aria-label="Forbes reported" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/giacomotognini/2025/12/19/meet-the-former-banker-warren-kanders-who-is-now-a-private-defense-billionaire/" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/giacomotognini/2025/12/19/meet-the-former-banker-warren-kanders-who-is-now-a-private-defense-billionaire/" target="_self" title="https://www.forbes.com/sites/giacomotognini/2025/12/19/meet-the-former-banker-warren-kanders-who-is-now-a-private-defense-billionaire/"><em data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/giacomotognini/2025/12/19/meet-the-former-banker-warren-kanders-who-is-now-a-private-defense-billionaire/">Forbes</em> reported</a> in December, Safariland is owned by Cadre Holdings, which is run by billionaire Warren Kanders, a former Morgan Stanley banker who has acquired a small army of defense and law enforcement weaponry and armour businesses over the years.

Its pepper spray is being used in Minneapolis; <em>Forbes</em> reviewed a court filing in Minnesota from earlier this month, in which a federal agent used “MK-9” pepper spray on a protestor. That brand of chemical weapon is sold by Safariland’s Defense Technology.</p><p>Kanders has donated primarily to Republican candidates, according to federal records. The billionaire, who once gave $2,700 to support Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential run, has shifted alliances, donating $8,400 to the National Republican Congressional Committee and $25,000 to the WinRed fundraising vehicle for the Republicans in 2024. He also backed Michael Waltz, donating $6,600 for his Congressional run and $5,000 for his Warrior Diplomat PAC.

It has sold over $400,000 in pepper spray and tear gas to ICE and CBP since Trump returned to the White House.
