<h1>FATAL ENCOUNTERS WITH CBP SINCE 2010</h1>
<p><em>Updated January 26, 2026</em></p>
<p><span>The U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), which includes the Border Patrol, is the largest federal law enforcement agency in the country. CBP’s lack of accountability and oversight paired with its culture of violence has resulted in the loss of lives of U.S. citizens and noncitizens. No on-duty agent in the  nearly 100-year history of the agency has been successfully convicted of a killing while on duty.</span></p>
<p></p>
<h2><strong><a name="top"></a></strong></h2>
<p><span>SBCC compiles fatal encounters through analysis of CBP press releases, media and news outlet reporting, and reports by community members from 2010 to current day. We define a “fatal encounter” as any instance in which a CBP agent is trying to apprehend an individual, has made contact with a person, and/or has a person in custody and that person passes away during the interaction or shortly after the interaction.  For instance, some types of fatal encounters we have included are:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Use of force incidents of any kind that result in death</span></li>
<li><span>Instances in which a person is being actively pursued by CBP on foot, in the water, or in a vehicle that results in loss of life</span></li>
<li><span>A response by CBP to any emergency call that results in a loss of life</span></li>
<li><span>Any sort of death that occurs in CBP custody for any reason </span></li>
<li><span>Off-duty homicides</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Since January 2010, 364</span><span> people have died as the result of  encounters with  CBP agents. Many more have been brutalized, in some cases causing life-altering injuries. These deaths are an undercount. According to a 2020 report from the Government Accountability Office, CBP does not have reliable information on deaths and has not consistently reported death-related information to Congress.</span></p>
<p><span>According to SBCC's analysis, 72 of these deaths were caused by an on-duty CBP agent’s use of force including a fatal shooting, asphyxiation, a Taser, beating or a chemical agent. Another </span><span>125</span><span> deaths were due to vehicle collisions involving Border Patrol, the majority (109) of which occurred during high-speed car chases initiated by Border Patrol. In addition, 108 of the deaths were related to failure to provide adequate medical attention or medical emergencies, either while individuals were in CBP custody or directly after an encounter with agents. Fifteen deaths were homicides carried out by off-duty officers and in these cases, agents were often charged, convicted and sentenced to prison time. Forty-four were due to unknown or other causes, including four cases of alleged suicide and twenty-eight drownings.</span></p>

<p><span>On March 12, 2024, at approximately 6:39 a.m., Border Patrol agents encountered three male individuals walking on Perry Mills Road, approximately 2.5 miles southwest of the Champlain Port of Entry. Border Patrol agents reported one of the migrants stated they were citizens of Bangladesh and had crossed the border into the United States illegally. Border Patrol agents transported the three migrants to the Champlain Station, arriving there at 7:02 a.m. where they were processed and placed in a holding cell.  </span></p>
<p><span>At approximately 7:34 a.m., Border Patrol agents responded to the holding cell because one of the migrants\was complaining of chest pains. While EMS personnel evaluated the migrant, his vital signs were reportedly within normal ranges, and he did not exhibit any signs of a medical issue. The migrant declined to be transported to the hospital, and EMS departed the facility at approximately 7:59 a.m.  </span></p>
<p><span>A short time later, a Border Patrol agent observed that the migrant was in distress and subsequently collapsed. A Border Patrol agent Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) proceeded to the holding cell and when they arrived, the migrant was slumped over on a wooden bench, had labored breathing, and was shaking.</span></p>
<p><span>Border Patrol Agents lowered the migrant to the ground and the Border Patrol agent EMT raised the migrant’s legs to increase blood flow to his torso. The migrant soon became unresponsive, and Border Patrol Agents initiated cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). At approximately 8:45 a.m., local EMS personnel transported the migrant to the Champlain Valley Physicians Hospital. Doctors there assumed medical care of the migrant and subsequently pronounced him deceased at approximately 9:42 a.m.</span></p>

<p><span>On March 8, 2024, at approximately 11:15 a.m., the U.S. Border Patrol El Centro Sector communications center broadcasted that a stolen vehicle, described as a white Dodge Caravan, was reportedly seen near the California Department of Food and Agriculture Station on Interstate 8 (I-8) in Winterhaven, CA.</span></p>
<p><span>At approximately 11:25 a.m., a Border Patrol agent in a Border Patrol marked vehicle encountered a vehicle matching the description at the intersection of I-8 and State Route 7 (SR 7) near Calexico, CA. The agent followed the vehicle and received a confirmation that it was the stolen vehicle from the earlier broadcast.  </span></p>
<p><span>At approximately 11:33 a.m., the agent activated his emergency equipment and performed a vehicle stop on the southbound shoulder of SR 7. The agent saw what appeared to be a firearm in the driver’s right hand and ordered him to drop it. As a second agent arrived at the scene of the traffic stop, the driver reentered his vehicle and drove away southbound on SR 7.</span></p>
<p><span>The second agent took the primary position in the pursuit and, at 11:35 a.m., broadcasted via radio a request for another agent to position himself so that he could deploy a Vehicle Immobilization Device (VID). At approximately 11:39 a.m., after traveling approximately 0.8 miles from the location of the VID deployment, the Dodge Caravan left the roadway, traveled across an open area on the side of the road, and drove into an irrigation ditch. The Dodge Caravan landed upside down with the windshield facing down on the opposite side of the irrigation canal and against the bank of the canal. </span></p>
<p><span>Agents requested local emergency medical services via radio and approached the Dodge Caravan and shouted commands but received no response from the driver. Agents attempted to open the driver’s-side door to remove the driver but were unsuccessful. Agents then broke out the vehicle’s windows and observed the driver unconscious and pinned inside the vehicle between the dash and floorboard. Because the agents could not get into the vehicle, they were unable to provide medical aid.  </span><span> </span></p>
<p><span>At approximately 11:56 a.m., Imperial County Fire and an American Medical Response ambulance arrived on scene. A short time later, the driver was pronounced deceased.</span></p>

<p><span>On March 6, 2024, at approximately 5:51 p.m., a U.S. Border Patrol (USBP) remote camera operator responsible for monitoring a USBP remote video surveillance system (RVSS) camera identified a possible human smuggling event occurring at a gas station located in Lukeville, Ariz. The RVSS operator observed a male and female in the vicinity of a gray Nissan Altima that was suspected of transporting undocumented migrants and advised agents of the suspected human smuggling activity.</span></p>
<p><span>At approximately 5:58 p.m., a Border Patrol agent (Agent 1) in a marked USBP vehicle observed the Nissan Altima traveling northbound on SR 85. During this time, another agent (Agent 2), also in a USBP vehicle began to follow Border Patrol Agent 1 and the Nissan Altima.</span></p>
<p><span>At approximately 6 p.m., the Nissan Altima slowed to approximately 45 mph, and a woman and man exited the moving vehicle from the right rear door. Border Patrol Agent 1 activated his emergency equipment and attempted to stop the Nissan Altima; however, the vehicle sped up and did not stop. Border Patrol Agent 2 stopped to provide aid to the woman and man who had previously exited the moving vehicle.</span></p>
<p><span>At approximately 6:02 p.m., the Nissan Altima stopped and agents took custody of the two remaining occupants of the vehicle. Border Patrol Agent 2 exited his vehicle to check on the man and woman, both of whom were later determined to be undocumented non-citizens from Mexico. The woman appeared to have only minor injuries, but the man was bleeding from his face, had labored breathing, and appeared to be unconscious. </span></p>
<p><span>At approximately 6:03 p.m., the agent called EMS and at approximately 6:14 p.m., a Border Patrol agent trained as an EMT arrived and assumed medical care. The man appeared to be semi-conscious, had vomited, and appeared to have broken his right arm. Agents continued to keep him in the recovery position. At approximately 6:35 p.m., EMS arrived and assumed medical care of the injured man. </span></p>
<p><span>At approximately 7:25 p.m., the man was transported to the hospital and medical personnel reported that his condition continued to deteriorate and moved him to the Intensive Care Unit at 11:48 p.m. On March 8, 2024, at 10:00 a.m., doctors said that the man had suffered a permanent loss of brain function and pronounced him deceased. On March 12, 2024, the Maricopa County Office of the Medical Examiner performed an autopsy. The preliminary cause of death was due to complications caused from blunt force trauma.</span></p>
<p><span>303. <strong>Unknown</strong><span><br/><strong>Age: 32</strong><br/><strong>Nationality: Mexico</strong><br/><strong>Cause of Death: Fatal Shooting</strong><br/><strong>Incident Date: March 3, 2024</strong><br/><strong>Incident Location: Otay Mountains, California</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span>On March 3, 2024, U.S. Border Patrol Tactical Unit (BORTAC) Border Patrol agents were conducting operations in the Puebla Tree area of the Otay Mountains, approximately five miles east of the Otay Mesa Port of Entry. BORTAC was actively monitoring this area – where there is a paved road winding through the mountains – because of recent reports of armed robberies and assaults targeting groups of migrants crossing into the United States. A small group of BORTAC agents was concealed approximately 70 yards north of the border along a ravine near the paved road. Additional BORTAC agents, including a precision marksman, were positioned on high ground approximately 275 yards away, providing overwatch of the area.</span></p>
<p><span>Based on witness interviews conducted by investigators, a group of migrants was walking on the paved road when they were approached by four individuals, at least one of whom was armed with a handgun. According to the witnesses, the armed individual demanded money from the group, racked his pistol to chamber a round, and pointed the weapon at one of the migrants. Then the migrants heard a single gunshot and observed the armed individual fall to the ground. The migrants informed investigators they did not know from where the gunshot was fired.</span></p>
<p><span>The BORTAC agents involved in the incident reported a similar description of events. They observed the armed individual threaten the migrants, chamber a round, and point a gun at one of the migrants – at which time the BORTAC precision marksman fired one round, striking the armed individual. No other injuries were reported.</span></p>
<p><span>At approximately 7:16 a.m., a Border Patrol agent EMT and another Border Patrol agent (a former EMT) arrived on scene and performed a medical assessment of the armed individual. Agents and EMS personell performed medical assessments and performed life saving measures. At approximately 8:14 a.m., after telephonically consulting with local EMS at the scene of the shooting, a physician at Sharp Grossmont Hospital (located in La Mesa, Calif.) pronounced the wounded individual deceased. </span></p>
<p><span>On March 5, 2024, the San Diego County Medical Examiner’s Office conducted an autopsy of the deceased individual. The autopsy report is pending. The deceased individual was subsequently identified as a 32-year-old male citizen of Mexico.</span></p>

<p><span>On February 25, 2024, at approximately 2:14 p.m., Border Patrol agents apprehended a pregnant woman later determined to be a citizen of Angola who was traveling with a group of 11 other migrants. At approximately 3:15 p.m., as a part of the booking process at Ajo station, an on-site CBP-contracted nurse practitioner evaluated the pregnant woman. The nurse practitioner noted that the woman complained of abdominal pain/cramping and back pain. The nurse practitioner reported that the woman believed she was approximately eight months pregnant, denied taking any medications, and had two previous miscarriages. The woman reported it had been more than three months since her last prenatal visit with an obstetrician. The nurse practitioner requested the woman be transported via ambulance to a hospital for further evaluation and care. Therefore, at approximately 3:50 p.m., EMS transported her to Abrazo Hospital West Campus in Goodyear, Ariz. A Federal Protective Services Inspector was assigned to hospital watch and followed the ambulance in a government vehicle.</span></p>
<p><span>On February 26, 2024, at approximately 1:45 a.m., the FPS inspector reported that the woman underwent an emergency cesarean section due to the doctor detecting a defect in the fetus’ heartbeat. Upon completion of the procedure, the newborn’s heartbeat was low and decreasing. Medical staff were unable to normalize the heartbeat and unsuccessfully attempted to resuscitate the newborn for approximately one hour. At approximately 2:45 a.m., medical staff declared the newborn deceased.</span></p>

<p><span>A Border Patrol agent searched the driver at 6:52 p.m. During the interaction, the agent removed the draw string from the driver’s pants and jacket explaining they were doing so for his own safety. The agent then provided the man his jacket and placed him in detention cell 103 at 6:57 p.m., where he was the sole occupant. </span></p>
<p><span>Agents escorted the driver to the processing area of the checkpoint at 7:21 p.m., electronically captured his fingerprints, and returned him to the detention cell. The driver requested to speak to his mother via cell phone at 7:41 p.m. A Supervisory Border Patrol agent escorted him to allow him to place a monitored phone call in the processing area. The driver requested agents call his mother instead, and at 7:46 p.m., he was returned to the detention cell.</span></p>
<p><span>At 10:39 p.m., two agents approached the cell to serve the driver with administrative paperwork. The first agent opened the door to the detention cell and observed the driver was unresponsive and suspended inches off the ground by his jacket, which was tied around a privacy partition and wrapped around his neck. </span></p>
<p><span>At 10:40 p.m., one agent attempted to lift the driver up by his arms, while another agent used a knife to cut the jacket. Border Patrol agents requested emergency medical services at 10:41 p.m., and the supervisory Border Patrol agent initiated CPR.

<p><span>291. <strong>Unknown</strong><br/><strong>Age: Unknown (1 month old infant)</strong><br/><strong>Nationality: Mexico</strong><br/><strong>Cause of Death: Medical</strong><br/><strong>Incident Date: September 23, 2023</strong><br/><strong>Incident Location: Nogales, AZ</strong></span></p>
<p><span>On September 23, 2023, at approximately 2:34 a.m., a Remote Video Surveillance System operator observed two individuals crossing the international boundary line on foot from Mexico into the United States. One individual returned to mexico but at 2:51am, a Border Patrol agent broadcasted over the radio that he had located the remaining individual, a 16-year-old female, along with her one-month-old infant daughter, both citizens of Mexico. The agent later reported to Customs and Border Protection’s Office of Professional Responsibility the mother was softly crying and sniffling when he first encountered her. The agent reported he observed the mother holding an infant who was covered in a blanket. The agent instructed the mother with child to get into his transport van and proceeded to drive towards the Nogales Border Patrol Station located 2.5 miles away.</span><strong></strong></p>
<p><span>The agent reported to CBP’s OPR personnel that during transport, the agent stopped the van when the mother attempted to speak to him from the other side of the security partition. The agent stated he did not understand what the mother was trying to communicate. The agent decided to continue transporting her and the infant to Nogales Station and request that a fluent Spanish speaker ascertain what the mother was trying to communicate. The agent later reported to CBP’s OPR he was not aware the infant was in distress until they arrived at Nogales Station, and the mother spoke with another agent.</span><strong></strong></p>
<p><span>Review of video from within Nogales Border Patrol Sation by CBP’s OPR revealed that at approximately 3:01 a.m., the agent and the mother carrying the infant walked into the sally port. The apprehending agent spoke with another Border Patrol agent who then spoke with the mother. That agent began to rapidly escort the mother and infant toward the medical screening area where CBP-contracted medical personnel were located at approximately 3:02 a.m. The second agent observed the infant had labored breathing and moved quickly with the infant toward medical personnel. This agent entered the first available room and medical personnel. Medical personnel immediately began resuscitation efforts including the use of an automated external defibrillator. After some time, Nogales Fire Department EMS personnel exited Nogales Station with the infant and agents escorted the mother to Carondelet Holy Cross Hospital in Nogales, Arizona at approximately 3:39 a.m.  Medical personnel at the hospital pronounced the infant deceased at 4:00 a.m.</span><strong></strong></p>
<p><span>CBP OPR special agents interviewed the mother of the infant. She said that she was traveling ahead of a group trying to cross into the US and noticed her infant daughter was struggling to breathe. She noticed that her daughter was still alive in the van on their way to the station. Once they arrived at the station, her daughter was not breathing and almost looked dead. At this point, agents took the infant to medical personnel. </span></p>

<p><span>287. <strong>Unknown</strong><br/><strong>Age: 29</strong><br/><strong>Nationality: Honduras</strong><br/><strong>Cause of Death: Medical</strong><br/><strong>Incident Date: August 28, 2023</strong><br/><strong>Incident Location: Harlingen, TX</strong></span></p>
<p><span>On Sunday, August 27, 2023, at approximately 8:30 p.m., an adult female citizen of Honduras and her two children (aged four and six) were taken into custody by Border Patrol agents (BPAs) assigned to the McAllen, Texas, Border Patrol Station. They were apprehended as part of a larger group of 15 noncitizens who had crossed into the United States illegally approximately 3.72 miles west of the Hidalgo Port of Entry and .8 miles south of the Anzalduas Port of Entry complex. CBP records indicate the noncitizen group was manifested for transport at approximately 8:41 p.m. The family arrived at the U.S. Border Patrol Donna Processing Facility (DPF) in Donna, TX, at approximately 11:02 p.m.A review of agency records by CBP’s Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) indicates that, while at the Donna Processing Facility, the woman and her children were medically screened and were cleared for travel.  </span></p>
<p><span>On Monday, August 28, 2023, at approximately 7:17 a.m., the woman and her children were transported from the Donna Processing Facility to the Harlingen Border Patrol Station for further processing. The woman and her children arrived at Harlingen Station at 8:02 a.m. on a bus along with approximately 40 other noncitizens. OPR reviewed video footage and determined the non-citizens were lined up alongside the bus and the sole medical provider on-duty, a CBP-contracted EMT-Basic, systematically conducted medical screenings of each noncitizen. There is no indication from the video review that the woman expressed any concerns or that she appeared to be in distress during the medical screening process. The medical screening process concluded at 8:20 a.m., and the group entered Harlingen Station at 8:23 a.m. After entering the station, the woman can be seen picking up boxed meals and entering a cell along with her children and approximately 34 other noncitizens at approximately 8:25 a.m. The woman is not seen on video again until approximately 11:45 a.m. when she steps out of the cell briefly to retrieve three meal boxes.</span></p>
<p><span>Because of intermittent system outages in the e3 detention module, which took place during the duration of this incident, certain events such as welfare checks were entered retroactively based on the recollection of the personnel involved. To ensure accurate reporting, CBP OPR reviewed video footage for the duration of time the woman was in custody at Harlingen Station. This revealed that BPAs conducted visual checks by looking into the window of her cell at 8:55 a.m., 9:19 a.m., 9:57 a.m., 10:37 a.m., 11:42 a.m., 12:36 p.m., 1:45 p.m., and 1:52 p.m. At 3:18 p.m. a BPA opened the door of the cell and spoke with a noncitizen briefly.</span></p>
<p><span>At approximately 3:58 p.m., BPAs approached the cell with meals for the noncitizens and opened the cell door. Shortly thereafter, a noncitizen adult female called out to BPAs.  Two BPAs entered the cell and checked on the woman. At 3:59 p.m., a BPA stepped out of the cell and called out for assistance. Approximately 20 seconds later, the CBP-contracted EMT ran into the cell.</span></p>
<p><span>Interviews of BPAs and the contracted EMT who initially treated the woman indicated she was found on a mat on the cell floor covered with a mylar blanket and that her skin appeared to be discolored and cold to the touch. BPAs and the CBP-contracted EMT immediately checked her vital signs, requested emergency medical services, initiated CPR, and applied an Automated External Defibrillator (AED).  </span></p>
<p><span>CBP personnel continued CPR with the assistance of the AED until the arrival of a South Texas Emergency Care (STEC) ambulance to HRL at 4:12 p.m. STEC personnel assumed responsibility for the woman’s care and departed HRL for Valley Baptist Medical Center (VBMC), Harlingen, TX, at approximately 4:31 p.m. The woman was officially declared deceased by a physician at the VBMC emergency room at 4:50 p.m.</span></p>
<p><span>CBP OPR interviewed other noncitizens who were in the cell with the woman and her children. None indicated they were aware that she was in medical distress or that she had expressed or exhibited signs of any medical conditions. They became aware of the fact she was nonresponsive when the BPAs approached the door to their cell to provide meals and observed that one of her children was crying. Upon witnessing her condition, they immediately notified the BPAs at the door.</span></p>

<p><span>BORSTAR agents located an adult female citizen of Colombia at approximately 6:30 p.m. in a very remote area approximately one quarter mile south of Arizona State Route 86 and mile marker 147 near Three Points, Ariz. Agents requested an air ambulance be placed on standby and for emergency medical services to respond. Agents reported the woman was conscious, lethargic, and vomiting. Agents initiated treatment for severe heat stroke.  </span></p>
<p><span>BORSTAR agents requested the air ambulance respond to transport the woman at approximately 6:34 p.m. Agents reported via radio they were actively providing care for the woman at approximately 6:40 p.m., and it would be a few minutes before they could move her. The Three Points Fire Department arrived at approximately 6:45 p.m. at the intersection of Road 147 and SR 87, a predetermined location for BORSTAR agents to meet Three Points Fire Department due to the remote location and difficult terrain.</span></p>
<p><span>Agents carried the woman via a stretcher approximately 200 yards to their marked Border Patrol truck at approximately 6:52 p.m. Then, they drove approximately a quarter mile to transfer medical care of the woman to fire department medical personnel. The air ambulance arrived at the location at approximately 7:13 p.m. and subsequently transported the woman to Banner University Medical Center in Tucson, Ariz., where she was admitted. A Border Patrol agent was dispatched to the medical center to provide hospital watch over the woman at approximately 7:52 p.m.</span></p>
<p><span>The woman was admitted and assigned to a hospital room for treatment and observation on July 12 at approximately 3:15 a.m. Agents conducting hospital watch duties reported at approximately 6:38 a.m. the woman had been declared deceased by medical center attending physicians due to cardiac arrest at 6:24 a.m.</span></p>

<p><span>On Friday, July 7, 2023, at approximately 7 p.m., Border Patrol agents assigned to the Santa Teresa New Mexico Border Patrol Station received notification of an individual in distress from the Dona Ana County Sheriff’s Office which included a general area to search. Agents responded in search of the individual at approximately 7:10 p.m. to an area approximately 3.43 miles northwest of the Santa Teresa, N.M. Port of Entry.</span></p>
<p><span>Agents encountered an unresponsive adult male Mexican citizen suffering from a seizure at approximately 7:20 p.m. Agents requested emergency medical services via radio at approximately 7:21 p.m. Agents checked the man’s vital signs and noted the man was breathing and had a pulse; they then poured water on him to cool him down and placed him in a recovery position.</span></p>
<p><span>Medical personnel from the Dona Ana County Fire Department arrived on scene at approximately 7:30 p.m. and began rendering aid. Additional medical personnel from American Medical Response arrived on scene at approximately 7:35 p.m. and assumed primary medical care. The man was transported at approximately 7:50 p.m. by AMR medical personnel to The Hospitals of Providence – Transmountain Campus for elevated treatment.

<p><span>275. <strong>Unknown</strong><br/><strong>Age: Unknown (Adult)</strong><br/><strong>Nationality: Guatemala</strong><br/><strong>Cause of Death: Drowning</strong><br/><strong>Incident Date: July 1, 2023</strong><br/><strong>Incident Location: Eagle Pass, TX</strong></span></p>
<p><span>On July 1, 2023, at approximately 4:35 p.m., a Border Patrol agent assigned to the U.S. Border Patrol Eagle Pass Station was patrolling the riverbank of the Rio Grande north of the Shelby Park Boat Ramp approximately 3.5 miles north of the Eagle Pass Port of Entry when he heard sounds of people struggling in the water. The agent walked towards the sounds and observed several migrants struggling to stay afloat while attempting to swim back to Mexico. In this area, the Rio Grande is approximately 264 feet wide with a moderately steep uneven embankment and a muddy river’s edge. The area is sparsely vegetated due to the City of Eagle Pass recently having cleared out the brush.</span></p>
<p><span>The agent called for assistance from a boat unit at approximately 4:35 p.m. The agent was able to assist one adult female migrant onto the U.S. shore. Two Texas Department of Public Safety patrol boats arrived and were able to rescue two migrants from the river and recovered two additional unresponsive migrants at approximately 4:43 p.m. Texas DPS personnel performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation on one adult female and one infant female migrant and transferred them to Border Patrol agents on the riverbank. Agents requested emergency medical assistance at their location via radio at approximately 4:45 p.m. Shortly after the arrival of the Texas DPS boats, two Border Patrol agent Emergency Medical Technicians arrived and alternated performing CPR for both migrants, rotating in other Border Patrol agents as agents became fatigued. Agents and Texas DPS EMTs utilized an automated external defibrillator on both migrants until EMS arrived. The AEDs did not recommend a shock for either migrant.</span></p>
<p><span>Eagle Pass Fire Department medical personnel arrived on scene and took over care of the two unresponsive migrants at approximately 4:58 p.m. At that time, neither migrant was breathing or had a pulse. The Eagle Pass Fire Department EMS ambulance departed the scene and transported the two unresponsive migrants to Fort Duncan Regional Medical Center in Eagle Pass, Texas at approximately 5:10 p.m. One Border Patrol agent EMT and one Texas DPS EMT accompanied the unresponsive migrants in the ambulance to the hospital to aid in performing CPR while one agent followed in a marked Border Patrol unit to establish hospital watch. The Eagle Pass Fire Department ambulance arrived at the medical center at approximately 5:19 p.m.</span></p>
<p><span>The two unresponsive migrants, later identified as an adult female citizen of Guatemala, and an infant female citizen of Guatemala, were pronounced deceased by doctors at the medical center at approximately 5:58 p.m.</span></p>
<p><span>U.S. Customs and Border Protection's Office of Professional Responsibility special agents conducted interviews of three adult migrants who were rescued during this incident.  One adult female migrant described the river as rising higher and higher as they tried to cross. Another rescued adult female migrant described the river as chest high but rising until she lost her balance and began to float. The adult male migrant who was interviewed stated the group was floating in the river for between 10 and 20 minutes before the rescue boats arrived. None of the migrants reported having observed the decedents while they were in the river. OPR special agents confirmed there is no video of the incident and there were no buoys or other obstructions installed in this area of the river.</span></p>
<p><span>This incident is being reviewed by CBP's Office of Professional Responsibility. The Department of Homeland Security's Office of Inspector General was also notified.</span></p>
<p>274. <strong>Unknown</strong><br/><strong>Age: 9</strong><br/><strong>Nationality: Unknown</strong><br/><strong>Cause of Death: Medical</strong><br/><strong>Incident Date: June 15, 2023</strong><br/><strong>Incident Location: Mesa, Arizona</strong></p>
<p><span>On June 15, 2023, at approximately 9:40 p.m., the Santa Cruz Sheriff’s Office patched over a 911 distress call to US Border Patrol Tucson Sector. The 911 call was from a female migrant and approximate GPS coordinates to the caller's location were provided. The female migrant advised agents she was traveling with her two minor children and stated her 9-year-old son was experiencing seizures. USBP Tucson Sector verified their location, with the GPS coordinates provided, and immediately informed the USBP Nogales Station the family unit was within their area of responsibility. Nogales agents were dispatched to locate the family unit. The Santa Cruz Sheriff’s Office requested Tubac Fire Department emergency medical services to respond to the location at approximately 9:41 p.m.</span></p>
<p><span>USBP Tucson Sector requested assistance from the National Guard Air Unit, via radio at approximately 9:55 p.m. The National Guard Air Unit located the family unit at the coordinates provided at approximately 10:01 p.m. The National Guard Air Unit provided agents with updated GPS coordinates to their location at approximately 10:02 p.m. Tubac Fire Department EMS arrived in the area at approximately 10:05 p.m. Tubac Fire Department EMS personnel, who were on foot, located the family unit at approximately 10:17 p.m. and conducted a quick trauma assessment of the child which consisted of checking for broken bones and bleeding. Tubac Fire Department EMS picked the child up and began walking him toward an ambulance along with a Border Patrol agent who had arrived on foot.</span></p>
<p><span>As they continued carrying the child, another agent who was operating an all-terrain vehicle located them at approximately 10:31 p.m. The agent assisted Tubac Fire Department personnel by transporting the 9-year-old to the ambulance via ATV, while a fire department EMT held the child. Approximately ten minutes later they arrived at the ambulance where fire department paramedics and EMTs began medical treatment on the child by administering intravenous fluids. Tubac Fire Department medical personnel transported him to Northwest Medical Center in Sahuarita, Ariz. at approximately 10:54 p.m., where agents established hospital watch.</span></p>
<p><span>The child was life flighted to Banner Desert Medical Center in Mesa, Ariz. on June 16, 2023 at approximately 2:45 p.m. Medical Center personnel diagnosed the child with multi-organ failure and placed him on life support while USBP maintained hospital watch. USBP completed administrative processing of the female migrant and her children at approximately 7:24 p.m. Agents advised medical center staff she and her children were no longer in USBP custody.</span></p>
<p><span>CBP Office of Professional Responsibility special agents interviewed the female migrant on June 16, 2023. The female migrant stated she and her sons crossed into the United States with another unknown male migrant on June 15, 2023, at approximately 2:30 a.m. The female migrant stated her son did not have prior existing medical issues and believed the heat contributed to his medical complications during their walk. The female migrant decided to call 911 from her cell phone at approximately 9:30 p.m., due to her son’s condition and the fact they had been without fluids for an hour and a half. After approximately 20 minutes, the female migrant saw a helicopter that shined a light on them to help find their location. The female migrant recalled the area being inaccessible to motor vehicles and recalled Border Patrol agents arriving on ATVs. The female migrant stated an agent on an ATV then transported her son to an ambulance, via ATV. The female migrant then walked, approximately 15 minutes, with her other son to a USBP transport van where they were given water and transported to Northwest Medical Center.</span></p>
<p><span>Banner Desert Medical Center personnel advised CBP's OPR on June 17, 2023 at approximately 5:43 p.m. that the child succumbed to his medical complications and was pronounced deceased at 8:44 p.m.</span></p>
<p><span>Maricopa Medical Examiner’s Office advised on June 19, 2023 an autopsy would not be performed. This incident is under review by CBP's OPR. The Department of Homeland Security's Office of Inspector General was also notified.</span></p>
<p>273. <strong>Raymond Mattia</strong><br/><strong>Age: Unknown</strong><br/><strong>Nationality: U.S.</strong><br/><strong>Cause of Death: Fatal Shooting</strong><br/><strong>Incident Date: May 18, 2023</strong><br/><strong>Incident Location: Tohono O’odham, Arizona</strong></p>
<p><span>On May 18, at approximately 9:04 p.m., the US Border Patrol Tucson Sector Tactical Operations Center advised the Ajo Border Patrol Station that the Tohono O’odham Nation Police Department was requesting assistance from Border Patrol agents to respond to a shots fired call west of the Menagers Dam Village.</span></p>
<p><span>The police department requested agents meet at the local recreation center prior to responding to the location. The Ajo Border Patrol Station transmitted a request over service radio for any available units to respond at approximately 9:06 p.m. Several agents responded acknowledging the request for assistance at approximately 9:07 p.m. An agent transmitted over service radio that agents were responding with the police department at approximately 9:21 p.m. Agents transmitted over service radio they had arrived at the recreation center with the police department at approximately 9:27 p.m. Agents coordinated with the police department officer at the recreation center and were provided additional information at approximately 9:31 p.m. The officer advised agents that initial reports indicated shots had been fired in the vicinity of a named individual’s residence west of their location. The officer requested agents follow him to the location at approximately 9:32 p.m. Agents followed behind the officer in their government vehicles for approximately two minutes and seventeen seconds.</span></p>
<p><span>The officer and agents arrived and parked their vehicles near the individual’s residence at approximately 9:35 p.m. Responding agents and the police officer spread out while searching for the man.</span></p>
<p><span>Customs and Border Protection’s Office of Professional Responsibility special agents reviewed video footage of the event. The officer and agents encountered an individual approximately 103 meters northwest of their parked vehicles, outside of a residence, at approximately 9:39 p.m. The individual threw an object toward the officer as they approached the structure which landed a few feet from the officer’s feet. Shortly after the individual threw the object, he abruptly extended his right arm away from his body and three agents fired their service weapons striking the individual several times. The individual fell to the ground, and the officer and agents slowly approached the man.  </span></p>
<p><span>Agents broadcasted over service radio that shots had been fired at approximately 9:40 p.m. Agents continued to approach the individual and secured him. Agents checked for a pulse, began medically assessing the man’s condition and requested emergency medical services at approximately 9:41 p.m.</span></p>
<p><span>Agents began administering cardiopulmonary resuscitation at approximately 9:45 p.m. after they were unable to detect a pulse from the individual. Agents requested air life medical evacuation for the man at approximately 9:46 p.m. Agents were advised there was no air life evacuation available due to inclement weather at approximately 9:48 p.m. Agents continued CPR until a Border Patrol emergency medical technician on scene telephonically contacted a physician at St. Mary’s Hospital in Tucson, Arizona. An agent transmitted over the service radio that the individual had no pulse at approximately 9:52 p.m. and agents continued to administer CPR.</span></p>
<p><span>The physician at St. Mary’s Hospital pronounced the man deceased at 10:06 p.m. The Pima County Medical Examiner’s Office assumed custody of the man’s remains pending an autopsy. </span></p>
<p><span>The decedent was identified as an adult male citizen of the United States. The Pima County Medical Examiner’s Office conducted an autopsy on May 19 and further information on the cause and manner of death will be released by that office at the conclusion of their review.</span></p>
<p><span>The agents involved in the incident are on administrative leave, pursuant to standard practice at this point in an investigation following a use of deadly force. All three agents who discharged their weapons and seven additional agents activated their body worn cameras during the incident. CBP is committed to expeditious release of the body worn camera footage of this incident as soon as is appropriate to do so without impacting the ongoing law enforcement investigation, in line with the May 25th, 2022, Executive Order on Advancing Effective Accountable Policing and Criminal Justice Practices to Enhance Public Trust and Public Safety.</span></p>
<p><span>The incident is currently under investigation by the Tohono O’odham Nation Police Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and is under review by CBP’s OPR. This incident will be reviewed by CBP’s National Use of Force Review Board at the conclusion of the investigation. The Department of Homeland Security’s Office of Inspector General was also notified of the incident.</span></p>
<p><span>On June 22, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP, Border Patrol’s parent agency) released edited body-worn camera footage depicting Raymond Mattia’s death. (The video contains heavy profanity and graphic violence.)  CBP provides the following details: The Tohono O’odham Nation Police Department, which had one officer on duty in the area, requested Border Patrol assistance at approximately 9 p.m. on May 18 to a shots-fired call west of the Menagers Dam Village. Agents from the Ajo Border Patrol Station met with the police officer and followed him to the location on Tohono O’odham Nation where the shots had been reported. The police officer and agents encountered an individual outside of a residence who threw an object toward the officers and abruptly extended his right arm away from his body. Three agents fired their service weapons, striking the individual several times.  </span></p>
<p>272. <strong>Anadith Tanay Reyes Alvarez</strong><br/><strong>Age: 8</strong><br/><strong>Nationality: Panama</strong><br/><strong>Cause of Death: Medical</strong><br/><strong>Incident Date: May 17, 2023</strong><br/><strong>Incident Location: Harlingen, Texas</strong></p>
<p><span>On May 9, 2023, at approximately 9:34 PM, a family group consisting of two parents (an adult female mother and adult male father) and three children (aged 8, 13, and 14) were taken into U.S. Border Patrol custody as part of a larger group of 47 non-citizens approximately eight tenths of a mile southeast of the Gateway International Port of Entry in Brownsville, TX. All members of the family group were Honduran citizens except the eight-year-old daughter who was a citizen of Panama. Records indicate that shortly after being taken into custody, the entire group was moved approximately four tenths of a mile east to the CBP-operated Camp Monument Staging Area where they awaited transportation to the Donna Processing Facility (DPF) in Donna, TX. The family of 5 was manifested for transport to the DPF at 9:50 PM, on May 9, 2023, and eventually transported there by bus in the early morning hours of May 10, 2023.</span></p>
<p><span>Review of video by CBP OPR personnel revealed the family of five arrived at the DPF at approximately 7:50 AM on Wednesday, May 10, 2023, and moved through various stages of intake and in-processing over the next four hours. At approximately 12:20 PM, the family entered the medical screening area and can be seen interacting with CBP-contracted medical personnel. At one point on the video footage, the mother can be seen handing several papers to the medical provider. CBP records indicate the eight-year-old was medically assessed at this time, did not complain of any acute illnesses or injuries, but the family did report a medical history including the chronic conditions of sickle cell anemia and heart disease. After completing the medical assessment, the female members of the family, specifically the mother, the fourteen-year-old adolescent, and the eight-year-old girl were escorted to their housing pod.</span></p>
<p><span>Further review of DPF video by CBP OPR revealed that on May 14, 2023, at approximately 4:11 PM, the mother and eight-year-old girl were escorted from their housing pod to the DPF medical unit where she can be seen entering a treatment area at 4:45 PM. CBP records indicate the eight-year-old girl had voiced complaints of abdominal pain, nasal congestion, and cough.  Contract medical staff recorded a tympanic temperature of 101.8 degrees Fahrenheit, after which a point of care influenza test was administered which yielded a positive result for Influenza A and a negative result for Influenza B. Medical personnel provided the girl with acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and prescribed and administered doses of Oseltamivir (Tamiflu), as well as Ondonsetron (Zofran). During this medical encounter, CBP contracted medical personnel documented a past medical history including cardiomyopathy (noting the girl had undergone heart surgery at the age of 5), about which the family reported that she has been stable since the operation, but still requires the continued care of a cardiologist. Based on agency protocols, a decision was made to transfer the entire family to the U.S. Border Patrol Station in Harlingen, TX (HRL), which has been designated for cases requiring medical isolation for individuals diagnosed with or closely exposed to communicable diseases.</span></p>
<p><span>Further review of DPF video by CBP OPR revealed that the entire family was reunited in the DPF out-processing area at approximately 5:09 PM and that they departed for the Harlingen Border Patrol Station (HRL) in Harlingen, Texas in a van approximately one hour later, arriving there at approximately 7:13 PM on May 14, 2023. CBP records indicate the eight-year-old girl was medically assessed by CBP-contracted medical personnel immediately upon her arrival at HRL.</span></p>
<p><span>CBP records indicate the eight-year-old girl continued to be administered Oseltamivir (Tamiflu) twice daily as directed on Monday, May 15, 2023, and Tuesday, May 16, 2023. CBP records also indicate the girl was administered ibuprofen at 7:45 PM on Wednesday, May 16, 2023, and again at 4:35 AM on May 17, 2023.</span></p>
<p><span>At this time, CBP can confirm that medical records documented that the eight-year-old girl and her mother came to the HRL medical unit at least three times on Wednesday, May 17, 2023. During the first visit, records indicate that the child complained of vomiting and was administered Ondansetron (Zofran) and instructed to hydrate and return if needed. During the second visit, the child complained of a stomachache. CBP contracted medical personnel annotated that she was stable and instructed the mother to follow-up if needed. CBP records indicate that a third visit took place at approximately 1:55 PM, during which the mother was carrying the girl who appeared to be having a seizure, after which records indicate the child became unresponsive.  CBP-contracted medical personnel subsequently began to administer CPR and summoned emergency medical services.</span></p>
<p><span>At approximately 2:07 PM, South Texas Emergency Care (STEC) emergency medical services arrived at HRL and took over lifesaving. The girl and her mother were transported to the Valley Baptist Medical Center in Harlingen, TX, where the girl was declared deceased by medical personnel at that facility at 2:50 PM.</span></p>
<p><span>An autopsy was performed on the child’s remains by the Cameron County Forensic Pathologist on the morning of Friday, May 19, 2023. Initial findings from the autopsy, which were shared with CBP OPR, indicated an absence of gross physical trauma, the presence of pleural effusions within the chest cavity, mentioned evidence that had been observed of the attempted surgical repair of the girl’s aortic stenosis, and also referenced the provided history of sickle cell anemia. Additional details regarding the cause and manner of death will be released by the medical examiner upon the completion of additional forensic medical laboratory tests, to include toxicological and pathological assays on recovered bodily fluids and tissue samples.</span><strong> </strong></p>
<p><span>On June 1, CBP’s Office of Responsiblity (OPR) released an update on their investigation. They state that because the closed-circuit television recording system at Harlingen Station was not functioning during the time the family was in custody and only three medical encounters were documented, this update is based largely on interviews of Border Patrol agents and contracted medical personnel who interacted with the family while they were in custody.</span></p>
<p><span>Between the time the family arrived at Harlingen Station on the evening of May 14 and the early morning hours of May 17, CBP contracted medical personnel reported having approximately nine encounters with the girl and her mother, who complained of fever, flu-like symptoms, and pain. CBP contracted medical personnel continued to administer Oseltamivir (Tamiflu) to the girl as prescribed and treated her fever (which peaked at 104.9 degrees during the early morning hours of May 16) with a combination of ice packs, antipyretic (fever reducing) medications, and a cold shower. Despite the girl’s condition, her mother’s concerns, and the series of treatments required to manage her condition, contracted medical personnel did not transfer her to a hospital for higher-level care.</span></p>
<p><span>During the day on May 17, the girl was seen by a nurse practitioner on four occasions after complaining of a stomachache, nausea, and difficulty breathing. The contracted nurse practitioner reported checking the girl’s heart rate and blood oxygen saturation with a pulse oximeter during each visit with normal findings, and administering Ondansetron (Zofran) for nausea at 9:33 a.m. The nurse practitioner also reported denying three or four requests from the girl’s mother for an ambulance to be called or for her to be taken to the hospital. Another contracted medical employee reported having brought a pile of documents and a bottle of folic acid tablets from the family’s property to the nurse practitioner at approximately 10:30 a.m. The nurse practitioner declined to review the papers but did agree to the mother’s request to administer one folic acid tablet to her daughter.</span></p>
<p><span>At approximately 1:55 p.m., shortly after their fourth visit with the nurse practitioner, the mother returned to the health unit with the girl in her arms. The girl appeared to be having a seizure.</span></p>
<p><span>Shortly thereafter, the child became unresponsive and medical personnel requested emergency medical services and initiated cardiopulmonary resuscitation aided by an automated external defibrillator, which did not recommend any defibrillation. At approximately 2:07 p.m., South Texas Emergency Care emergency medical services arrived at Harlingen Station and took over lifesaving efforts. The girl and her mother were transported separately to the Valley Baptist Medical Center in Harlingen, where the girl was declared deceased by medical personnel at that facility at 2:50 p.m. The last two medical encounters were documented by the nurse practitioner after the girl departed Harlingen Station for the hospital.</span></p>
<p><span>OPR’s review to date has determined that none of the CBP contracted medical personnel or U.S. Border Patrol personnel at Harlingen Station who interacted with the girl, or her mother, acknowledged being aware she suffered from sickle cell anemia or had a history of congenital heart disease. Contracted medical personnel did not consult with on-call physicians (including an on-call pediatrician) about the girl’s condition, symptoms, or treatment. The contracted medical personnel failed to document numerous medical encounters, emergency antipyretic interventions, and administrations of medicine. A review of CBP records revealed the camera system at Harlingen Station was flagged for repair/replacement on April 13. The outage was not reported to CBP OPR as required by H.R. 1158, Fiscal Year 2020 DHS Consolidated Appropriation. Closed circuit television recording capabilities were restored at Harlingen Station on May 23.</span></p>
<p><span>271. <strong>Unknown</strong><br/><strong>Age: Unknown</strong><br/><strong>Nationality: Mexico</strong><br/><strong>Cause of Death: Medical</strong><br/><strong>Incident Date: May 7, 2023</strong><br/><strong>Incident Location: Carrizo Springs, Texas</strong></span></p>
<p><span>On May 7, 2023, at approximately 12:21 a.m., Del Rio Border Patrol Sector Border Intelligence Center personnel received a 911 emergency call forwarded by the Dimmit County Sheriff’s Office. The call was from a man who stated he was traveling with his father-in-law and brother-in-law. The man stated they were lost and in distress. The approximate location of the caller was shared with the Carrizo Springs Border Patrol Station management. Carrizo Springs Station management immediately dispatched Border Patrol agents to attempt to locate the three individuals and also advised Dimmit County Emergency Medical Services of the situation and requested they remain on standby.</span></p>
<p><span>A Border Patrol agent located the three lost individuals at approximately 12:55 a.m. The agent noticed one of the individuals, later identified as a citizen of Mexico, had rapid breathing and was unable to communicate. The agent immediately requested Emergency Medical Services and placed the man in the recovery position to cool him down. EMS personnel arrived at approximately 1:30 a.m. and began medical treatment by administering IV fluids and oxygen to the man. EMS then requested an air evacuation unit but were told none were available. EMS placed him on a stretcher, loaded him into the ambulance, and transported him to the Dimmit Regional Hospital at approximately 1:40 a.m</span></p>
<p><span>They arrived at the hospital at approximately 2:11 a.m. and the man was treated for respiratory distress and was monitored under hospital watch by a Border Patrol agent. Hospital personnel performed multiple life saving measures during the following 2 hours, but were unsuccessful. The man was declared deceased by hospital medical personnel at approximately 4:20 a.m., and his body was transported to the Webb County Medical Examiner’s Office pending an autopsy.</span></p>
<p><span>Customs and Border Protection’s Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) special agents interviewed the Border Patrol agents who responded to the call. Both agents stated throughout the incident that the man in medical distress had rapid breathing and was unable to communicate. The agents stated they attempted to cool him down by providing water, fanning him, and waited for approximately 30 minutes until EMS personnel arrived.</span></p>
<p><span>CBP’s OPR special agents interviewed the two undocumented noncitizens who were traveling with the man in medical distress. Both identified themselves as citizens of Mexico and said they were the man’s sons-in-laws. Both stated they all had walked through the brush for three days and did not have enough water for the type of walking and high temperatures they endured. The men told special agents they ran out of water the day prior and after approximately 3 to 4 hours, their father-in-law began to panic. As the group rested, their father-in-law laid down and began breathing rapidly. Approximately three to four hours later, the men could not wake him up and decided to make a 911 emergency call. The men stated that Border Patrol arrived approximately 20 minutes later and instantly attempted to cool down their father-in-law with water.</span></p>

<p><span>On April 26, 2023, at approximately 3:12 p.m., a male traveler, later identified as a U.S. citizen, applied for entry into the United States via the pedestrian lanes at the Progresso Port of Entry and was inspected by a Customs and Border Protection Officer. The man was referred to secondary inspection by the officer due to a computer-generated referral; he collapsed to the floor while walking to secondary inspection. Responding officers assessed the man, determined he did not have a pulse and began cardiopulmonary resuscitation, administered Narcan and used an automated external defibrillator. Officers then requested that emergency medical services be dispatched to the port of entry. EMS arrived and transported the man to the Knapp Medical Center in Weslaco, Texas, at approximately 3:32 p.m.</span><strong></strong></p>
<p><span>The man was declared deceased by Knapp Medical Center personnel at approximately 4:15 p.m. An autopsy is pending with the Hidalgo County Medical Examiner and Coroner.</span></p>

<p><span>On April 3, 2023, at approximately 3:37 p.m., a Border Patrol agent assigned to the Yuma Station patrolling the International Border Fence observed footprints leading north from the border fence. The agent followed the prints approximately 100 yards to an area located near Avenue 1E, approximately 4.5 miles southeast of the Highway 195 and South Avenue B intersection, near San Luis, Ariz. The agent then observed a male subject lying under a bush. The agent gave the man commands to stand up; the man complied but requested assistance to stand. At this point the man was awake and coherent with no visible physical injuries apparent. The agent took the man, a Mexican national, into custody and escorted him to a marked U.S. Border Patrol vehicle. The man complained to the agent that he did not feel well once inside the vehicle and requested medical assistance. At this point the man began to lose consciousness.</span><strong></strong></p>
<p><span>The agent requested via radio, at 3:41 p.m., for San Luis Emergency Medical Services to be dispatched and transported the man to the intersection of South Avenue B and Highway 195 to meet the ambulance.  EMS arrived at 3:51 p.m. and transported the man to the Yuma Regional Medical Center for further treatment, arriving at 4:14 p.m. The agent followed the ambulance to the hospital and established a hospital watch. Medical staff at the hospital reported cocaine in the man’s system.</span></p>
<p><span>Yuma Regional Medical Center medical staff declared the man brain dead at approximately 1:33 p.m. on April 4. Prosecutorial discretion was exercised and the man was released from U.S. Border Patrol custody on April 5. Customs and Border Protection’s Office of Professional Responsibility received information on April 19 from the Yuma County Medical Examiner’s Office stating the man was pronounced deceased at 2:28 p.m. on April 7.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>268. <strong>Unknown</strong><br/><strong>Age: Unknown</strong><br/><strong>Nationality: U.S. Citizen</strong><br/><strong>Cause of Death: Fatal Shooting</strong><br/><strong>Incident Date: April 2, 2023</strong><br/><strong>Incident Location: Las Cruces, New Mexico</strong></span></strong></p>
<p><span>On April 2, 2023, at approximately 8:37 p.m., a Border Patrol agent observed a white Nissan Rogue sports utility vehicle circumvent a U.S. Border Patrol checkpoint located on Interstate 10, approximately 23 miles west of Las Cruces, New Mexico, and began to follow. The agent activated his emergency equipment to conduct a vehicle stop at approximately 8:39 p.m.  A second agent responded to assist. The driver of the SUV failed to yield and continued traveling west on I-10 at approximately 40 miles per hour, before exiting onto the I-10 frontage road at mile marker 116. The driver of the SUV turned off of the frontage road at approximately 8:44 p.m. and headed west onto County Road C001, where a third agent responded to assist.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>After traveling approximately 7.6 miles west on C001, the driver of the SUV approached a closed vehicle gate near a residence on the Burris Ranch at approximately 9:01 p.m. The driver of the SUV turned his vehicle around and stopped the SUV facing east toward I-10 on C001. Agents exited their vehicles and approached the SUV positioning themselves at the driver side, rear driver side, and front passenger side windows with their weapons drawn. Agents ordered the driver to show his hands and exit the vehicle, but he did not comply. Agents attempted to open the driver side door by pulling the handle but were unsuccessful. An agent then struck the driver side window with his collapsible straight baton; however, the window did not break. At that point, the driver of the SUV drove away from agents and travelled east on C001. Agents requested assistance from additional personnel via radio and the deployment of a vehicle immobilization device.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Responding agents successfully deployed an immobilization device on the SUV approximately 0.4 miles west of the intersection of C001 and the I-10 frontage road at approximately 9:18 p.m. Three of the SUV’s tires came into contact with the device. The driver of the SUV continued eastbound on the I-10 frontage road at approximately 22 mph and traveled approximately 1.7 miles east, before turning north onto County Road C003.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>After traveling approximately 1.4 miles north on C003, the driver of the SUV stopped and exited the vehicle on foot at approximately 9:26 p.m. </span></p>
<p><span>The driver of the SUV drove for a total of approximately 22.7 miles and for a duration of approximately 49 minutes between the time he circumvented the U.S. Border Patrol checkpoint and ultimately exiting his vehicle and walking north on C003, an unpaved road.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Three U.S. Border Patrol agents, wearing body worn cameras, began capturing video footage at approximately 9:26 p.m., which was reviewed by Customs and Border Protection’s Office of Professional Responsibility. The video showed  the driver of the SUV moving north on foot on C003, away from the three agents, as they repeatedly ordered him to stop. The driver was holding a shirt in one hand and a wooden club in the other.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>The driver was approached by several agents at gunpoint approximately 15-20 seconds after he began walking north on C003. The driver then swung the club three times in close proximity to one of the agents, who holstered his weapon and moved backwards to create distance. The driver once again began to walk away from the agents who repeatedly instructed him to stop and to drop the club. The driver once again swung the club three times at an approaching agent approximately six seconds later. An agent attempted to deploy an electronic control weapon twice over the next minute after instructing the driver to stop and drop the club. The driver appeared to prevent the taser from successfully deploying on both occasions by blocking the prongs with a shirt he was holding.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>The driver continued to walk away from the agents, who continued to follow and order him to stop and drop the club, over the next three minutes. As the driver continued to walk along a fence line parallel to C003, another agent arrived in a marked unit and approached the driver with his extended baton in hand. This agent ordered the driver to stop and put the wooden club down. The driver swung his club as the agent approached, making contact with the agent’s baton, and swung his club a second time but did not strike the agent as the agent fell backward. The driver continued advancing toward the agent, who was now on the ground, swung the wooden club a third time and struck the agent. The driver struck the agent a second time as he stood over him and was preparing to do so again when three other agents fired their service weapons, striking the driver. The agents fired approximately 16 rounds.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>The driver fell to the ground a few feet from where the agent had fallen on his back. Agents then approached the driver, removed the wooden club from his hands, secured him and then placed him into a recovery position. An agent who was trained as an emergency medical technician checked the driver for a pulse while other agents requested an ambulance along with medical assistance from emergency medical services. Agents did not observe any movement or signs of life from the driver of the SUV, who has since been identified as an adult male citizen of the United States.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>The Dona Ana County Sheriff’s Office and EMS personnel arrived on scene at approximately 10:08 p.m. The sheriff’s deputies secured the perimeter of the scene until CBP’s Office of Professional Responsibility arrived. The Department of Homeland Security’s Office of Inspector General was also notified and arrived on scene. The New Mexico Office of the Medical Investigator arrived on scene at approximately 4:40 a.m. on April 3, and declared the male driver deceased at 5:16 a.m.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Approximately four minutes and 20 seconds elapsed between the time the driver began walking north on C003 after exiting his vehicle and when shots were fired. The driver, and the agents following him during that time, traveled approximately 0.2 miles.  </span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>The New Mexico Office of the Medical Investigator conducted an autopsy on the male driver on April 4. Further information on the cause and manner of death will be released by that office at the conclusion of their review.</span></p>

<p><span>On March 14, 2023, at approximately 6:18 p.m. a U.S. Border Patrol remote camera operator observed multiple suspected undocumented migrants load into a BMW sedan, approximately one mile north of the Port of Entry at Sasabe, Ariz. The camera operator transmitted the information to Border Patrol agents in the area via radio.  </span></p>
<p><span>Two agents who were parked in separate marked Border Patrol vehicles near mile marker 12 on State Route 286 observed a BMW pass their location driving northbound and began to follow. The driver of the BMW was reportedly driving in an erratic manner turning the vehicle’s turn signals on and off and speeding up and slowing down.  </span></p>
<p><span>The agents activated their emergency equipment to conduct a vehicle stop at 6:34 p.m. The BMW failed to yield, and a pursuit ensued. The BMW turned westbound Near mile marker 20 on SR 286 onto Brown Bear Canyon Road, and the agents continued to pursue the vehicle. The driver of the BMW turned the vehicle to the south 3.8 miles west of SR 286 at approximately 6:41p.m., while attempting to turn around.</span></p>
<p><span>Customs and Border Protection’s Office of Professional Responsibility special agents reviewed incident driven video recording system footage related to the incident captured by body worn camera. The footage showed the first Border Patrol agent who arrived positioned his Border Patrol vehicle behind the BMW, exited his vehicle, and approached the driver’s side of the BMW. The agent used his collapsible straight baton to break the rear and front driver’s side windows of the BMW. The agent reached into the vehicle as the vehicle moved in reverse. The driver of the BMW continued to move the vehicle backwards as the agent attempted to hold the driver’s left arm.  The vehicle stopped and the driver changed gears and started turning the steering wheel with his right hand while the agent was holding him by his left forearm, which was outside and below the driver’s side window. The agent drew his handgun and fired one time striking the driver of the BMW.</span></p>
<p><span>Border Patrol agents secured the six occupants of the vehicle which included one U.S. citizen who was sitting in the front seat and exited the vehicle immediately before the shooting, two undocumented migrants in the back seat, and three additional undocumented migrants in the trunk. Both agents, who were trained as emergency medical technicians, rendered aid to the driver of the vehicle by performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation and using an automated external defibrillator. The driver, a U.S. citizen, was declared deceased on the scene by the Pima County Sheriff’s Department.</span></p>

But as Sato-Smith started his turn, 37-year-old Jacumba Hot Springs resident Ellis James Woodall was beginning to pass on his Kawasaki motorcycle. Woodall slammed into the driver’s side of the Border Patrol van, ending up pinned under its right rear tire. He died at the scene. There is a currently an open case which seeks to determine whether Border Patrol Agent Dustin Sato-Smith is immune from prosecution or if he will face the charge of a misdemeanor count of vehicular manslaughter without gross negligence. </span></p>
<p><span>260. <strong>Jose Leos Cervantes<br/>Age: 45<br/>Nationality: Mexico<br/>Cause of Death: Medical<br/>Incident Date: February 19th, 2023<br/>Incident Location: Vermont</strong></span></p>
<p><span>On February 19, at approximately 11 p.m., U.S. Border Patrol personnel operating a remote camera detected a group of three individuals suspected of illegally entering the United States from Canada into Vermont.  Border Patrol radio communication personnel transmitted information about the individuals to Border Patrol agents and, at approximately 11:15 p.m., patrolling agents responded to the area approximately 1.9 miles southeast of the Derby Line, Vermont Port of Entry, to apprehend the group.</span></p>
<p><span>Two of the individuals fled on foot northbound towards the Canadian border as Border Patrol agents approached the group. Agents noticed the third person was propping himself against a tree. An agent observed this man groan loudly and collapse to the ground in medical distress a short time later. </span></p>
<p><span>The Border Patrol agents requested emergency medical services via radio and performed chest compressions on the man until emergency medical services arrived. A local ambulance crew arrived at approximately 11:40 p.m., took over primary care, and attached an automated external defibrillator to the man’s chest. The ambulance transported the man to a local hospital in Newport where the man, later identified as a citizen of Mexico, was pronounced deceased by a doctor at 12:34 a.m.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>259. <strong>Unknown</strong><br/><strong>Age: Unknown</strong><br/><strong>Nationality: Mexico</strong><br/><strong>Cause of Death: Fatal Car Crash</strong><br/><strong>Incident Date: February 11th, 2023</strong><br/><strong>Incident Location: Douglas, Arizona</strong></span></strong></p>
<p><span>On February 11, 2023, at approximately 5 p.m., Border Patrol agents assigned to the Willcox Station observed a red 2003 Toyota Corolla depart the Highway 191 Checkpoint, located approximately 29 miles north of Douglas, Arizona, without being inspected. A Douglas Station agent, also working at the checkpoint, activated the emergency equipment on his marked Border Patrol unit and initiated a pursuit of the Corolla. Based on the radio traffic, the pursuit was ordered terminated by a Douglas Station supervisor after two minutes and 24 seconds due to the high rate of speed. The Corolla continued northbound on highway 191 toward Interstate 10.</span></p>
<p><span>A Willcox Station Border Patrol agent assisting Arizona Department of Public Safety with a smuggling related traffic scene near mile marker 311 on I-10, notified Arizona DPS of the failure to yield and the possibility the vehicle was headed in their direction. The agent left this scene and drove eastbound on I-10 to try and locate the Corolla.</span></p>
<p><span>The Border Patrol agent observed a red Corolla pass his location in the westbound lanes of I-10 followed by a Cochise County Sheriff’s Office vehicle at approximately 5:30 p.m. The agent turned around in the median but was unable to immediately gain entry onto I-10 due to traffic. The agent observed the Sheriff’s Office vehicle activate its emergency equipment to initiate a traffic stop of the Corolla. The Corolla accelerated and began driving away from the Sheriff’s Office vehicle. The agent gained access to I-10 and drove approximately one-half mile behind the Sheriff’s Office vehicle with emergency lights activated. Arizona DPS troopers, stationed near the traffic stop at mile marker 311, deployed a vehicle immobilization device to stop the Corolla. The Corolla attempted to evade the immobilization device and struck the rear trailer of a semi-truck. The collision caused the Corolla to spin and strike the rear compartment area of the semi-truck.</span><strong></strong></p>
<p><span>Sheriff’s Office deputies and Arizona DPS troopers located four undocumented migrants, in varying degrees of physical distress due to the collision, inside the passenger compartment and trunk of the  Corolla. An emergency medical service Life Flight was requested and flew three of the undocumented migrants to Banner Main Hospital in Tucson, Ariz. for emergency care while the fourth undocumented migrant was transported to Benson Hospital for evaluation and treatment. The driver of the Corolla was identified as a United States citizen and arrested by the Sheriff’s Office. Border Patrol agents responded to both hospitals and established a hospital watch on the injured undocumented migrants.</span></p>
<p><span>One of the injured undocumented migrants transported to Banner Main Hospital, a citizen of Mexico, suffered severe trauma and was unresponsive. The undocumented migrant remained hospitalized after U.S. Customs and Border Protection processed and released the migrant from CBP custody on February 15. Pima County Medical Examiner’s Office notified CBP personnel the undocumented migrant died on February 24 while being treated at Banner Main Hospital.</span></p>

<p><span>On February 6, 2023, at approximately 12:05 a.m., a black GMC Yukon SUV approached the U.S. Border Patrol immigration checkpoint located near mile marker 26 on State Highway 185, approximately 23 miles northwest of Las Cruces, N.M. The vehicle stopped at the primary inspection point and a Border Patrol agent approached the vehicle. While inspecting the vehicle, the agent noticed multiple people laying on the floorboard of the vehicle. The agent suspected the individuals laying on the floorboard of the vehicle might be undocumented migrants.</span></p>
<p><span>The agent retrieved a vehicle immobilization device which he had earlier placed on a jersey barrier. As the agent reapproached the vehicle with the immobilization device, the driver of the vehicle accelerated and quickly drove away from the inspection area, before the immigration inspection was completed. As the vehicle was leaving the primary inspection point, the agent placed the vehicle immobilization device in front of the driver’s side rear tire, and the tire rolled over the left device.</span></p>
<p><span>The Border Patrol agent motioned to another agent, who was staged in a vehicle at the checkpoint, indicating to the staged agent that the SUV fled from the checkpoint during the inspection. The staged agent left the checkpoint in an attempt to catch up to the SUV. In addition, a second agent ran to a nearby Border Patrol vehicle and also drove northbound to attempt to catch up to the vehicle.</span></p>
<p><span>Approximately .55 miles north of the checkpoint, the agents encountered a large cloud of dust that covered both sides of the road, and determined the SUV drove off-road but could not see the vehicle. The agents continued north on the highway in search of the vehicle. One of the agents then turned back south toward the area where the cloud of dust was located and found the SUV, which had been involved in a single vehicle rollover. Agents notified El Paso Sector Communications and requested emergency medical services to respond to the scene of the collision. Agents located occupants from the vehicle and rendered aid.</span></p>
<p><span>American Medical Response responded to the scene at 12:26 a.m. and transported three injured migrants to Mountain View Medical Center in Las Cruces, NM. Another migrant was transported to the medical center by a Border Patrol agent, in a U.S. Border Patrol vehicle and an additional migrant was transported in a Native Air Ambulance helicopter to the University Medical Center in El Paso, Texas. A sixth migrant, later identified as a female citizen of El Salvador, was declared deceased at the scene by New Mexico Office of the Medical Investigator personnel.</span></p>
<p><span>CBP Office of Professional Responsibility special agents responded to the scene along with Dona Ana County Sheriff's Office deputies and New Mexico State Police. The scene of the collision was approximately 962 yards north of the Highway 185 checkpoint. An examination of the scene revealed that the SUV left approximately 269 feet of tire marks prior to leaving the roadway. The vehicle then flipped and rolled approximately 118 feet and came to rest east of Highway 185.</span></p>
<p><span>CBP Office of Professional Responsibility special agents interviewed four of the migrants involved in the incident. One of the migrants stated that he was hiding on the floorboard of the vehicle, when the driver stopped at the checkpoint. The migrant stated the driver stopped for approximately five seconds before leaving the checkpoint at a high rate of speed. The migrant stated he looked at the speedometer and watched it accelerate from 60-80 miles per hour. The migrant stated he remembered seeing flashing lights just before the vehicle rolled over. Each of the other migrants interviewed stated the driver of the SUV left the checkpoint at a high rate of speed; however, none of the other migrants recalled seeing any emergency lights prior to the vehicle rolling over.</span></p>
<p><span>Special agents interviewed the agent who was working the primary inspection area at the time of the incident. The agent stated that prior to the SUV’s arrival to the primary inspection point he placed the vehicle immobilization device on the jersey barrier, close to the primary inspection point, because they have had a frequent occurrence of vehicles fleeing from the checkpoint. When he saw the people on the floorboard of the vehicle, he felt the driver of the vehicle might try to flee the checkpoint. The driver accelerated as he turned to retrieve the device and the agent placed the device in front of the rear tire as it left the primary inspection area. The agent stated he could hear air leaving the tire as the vehicle left the checkpoint.</span></p>
<p><span>Special agents interviewed the agents who followed northbound in Border Patrol vehicles after the SUV fled the checkpoint. Each of the agents stated they followed north to search for the vehicle once they were alerted that the SUV fled the checkpoint. Once they came upon a giant dust cloud they continued to search for the vehicle northbound on Highway 185. One of the agents then turned southbound on 185 and found the SUV in the area of the dust cloud.</span></p>
<p><span>Special agents reviewed radio communications related to the incident. An analysis of the radio communications revealed a 20 second lapse between the time a Border Patrol agent broadcasted that a vehicle fled the checkpoint and acknowledged the use of the vehicle immobilization device and the time the agent searching for the SUV came upon the dust cloud.</span></p>
<p><span>Special agents reviewed video footage captured from the Highway 185 checkpoint. The video captured the interaction between the agent and the driver of the SUV. The video captured the SUV stopping at the primary inspection area for approximately eight seconds before accelerating away from the checkpoint. A second camera at the checkpoint reveals the agents left the checkpoint approximately 16 seconds after the SUV fled the checkpoint.</span></p>

<p><span>On January 13, 2023, at approximately 11:00 a.m., Border Patrol agents assigned to the Ajo Border Patrol Station apprehended seven undocumented migrants approximately 39 miles northwest of the Lukeville, Arizona, Port of Entry. One of the migrants, later identified as a male citizen of Mexico, sustained an injury to his left ankle while attempting to elude apprehension. Agents contacted Tucson Sector radio communications and requested medical assistance for the injured migrant via radio at 11:08 a.m. A Border Patrol agent certified as an Emergency Medical Technician was transported on a Customs and Border Protection helicopter to the remote location to treat the man. The agent EMT arrived at the area at approximately 12:05 p.m. and evaluated the man.  </span></p>
<p><span>After the medical evaluation, the Border Patrol agents then escorted the group to U.S. Border Patrol vehicles to transport them to a CBP facility for processing. Prior to transporting the group to a CBP facility, the agent EMT reportedly conducted a second medical evaluation of the man between 12:45 and 1:00 p.m. and observed increased bruising and slight swelling on the man’s foot. The group was transported to a forward operating base located 23 miles northwest from the Lukeville Port of Entry. The injured migrant was transported in the back seat of a U.S. Border Patrol four-door pickup driven by an agent and accompanied by the agent EMT. Other members of the group were reportedly transported in a Border Patrol transport van. The agents and migrant group reportedly arrived at the forward operating base at approximately 1:50 p.m., according to the agent EMT’s patient care report.   </span></p>
<p><span>The agents fingerprinted the migrant group at the forward operating base for identification purposes. The agents then transported the group to Ajo Border Patrol Station in Why, Ariz. The agents and migrants reportedly departed the forward operating base at approximately 2:00 p.m. Again, the injured migrant was transported in the back seat of a Border Patrol four-door pickup driven by an agent and accompanied by the agent EMT and the other members of the group were transported in a Border Patrol transport van. The agents transported the migrants over rough terrain and mountain roads and arrived at the Ajo Border Patrol Station at approximately 3:14 p.m.</span></p>
<p><span>The man was evaluated by a CBP-contracted medical personnel at 3:18 p.m. at the Ajo Border Patrol Station. The man complained of left lateral ankle pain extending up his leg to his pelvis. The CBP-contracted physician observed swelling, but no deformities were obvious. The physician recommended the man be transported to the emergency room for x-rays and further evaluation. The man initially stated he did not want any additional medical treatment and signed a patient medical refusal form and reportedly stated he wanted to return to Mexico instead. Later, the man reportedly changed his mind and requested additional medical care. </span></p>
<p><span>An agent transported the injured migrant in a wheelchair to an interview room to wait while preparations were made to transport the man to the hospital. The man reportedly told that agent at 4:01 p.m., while waiting in the interview room, that he felt like vomiting and asked the agent to retrieve a trashcan. The agent handed him a trashcan, and he reportedly stuck his finger in his mouth to induce vomiting.  However, the man was unsuccessful and told the agent that he was okay.</span></p>
<p><span>A while later, the agents handcuffed the man with his hands in front and placed him in the rear passenger seat/prisoner compartment of a U.S. Border Patrol four-door pickup truck to transport him to the Abrazo Buckeye Emergency Medical Center in Buckeye, Ariz. Reportedly no other restraints were applied. The Ajo Border Patrol Station's surveillance cameras captured the Border Patrol pickup truck transporting the man, leaving the Ajo Border Patrol Station at 4:21 p.m. </span></p>
<p><span>During the trip, the man reportedly became agitated and began to kick the interior of the USBP vehicle. Additionally, the man questioned the transporting agent whether he had any backup during the transport. The agent decided to stop for assistance from other agents at the Arizona State Route 85 immigration checkpoint. The checkpoint is located in a remote area between Ajo, Ariz. and Gila Bend, Ariz. and approximately 35 miles north of the Ajo Station.</span></p>
<p><span>The agent arrived at the SR 85 immigration checkpoint at approximately 4:58 p.m. and was assisted by another agent and a supervisory agent, who both reportedly observed the man acting in a combative and agitated manner while sitting in the back seat. The man was holding his t-shirt in his hands with his hands in front of him and appeared to be sweating. The agent and supervisory agent offered the man water while trying to calm him down. The agent and supervisory agent suspected the man’s behavior may be related to the ingestion of drugs. The agent placed a phone call to a supervisory agent at the Ajo Border Patrol Station and suggested that Emergency Medical Services be dispatched. </span></p>
<p><span>After a brief period of time, the supervisory agent at the SR 85 checkpoint decided to call 911 on his cell phone; however, due to the cellular signal in the area the supervisory agent reportedly had difficulties completing the call. The supervisory agent spoke with a 911 operator at approximately 5:14 p.m.  At that point, the man was calm and the supervisory agent told the 911 operator that there was no longer a need to send EMS, which was located approximately 20 miles away. The man reportedly told the supervisory agent, “I’m okay.” The supervisory agent instructed an agent assigned to the immigration checkpoint to accompany the transporting agent for the remainder of the trip, for safety due to the man’s behavior. The two agents departed the SR 85 immigration checkpoint at approximately 5:21 p.m.</span></p>
<p><span>The agents arrived at the Abrazo Buckeye Emergency Center, located approximately 59 miles from the SR 85 immigration checkpoint at approximately 6:25 p.m. The agents indicated the man was calm and quiet for the trip from the SR85 immigration checkpoint and believed he was sleeping. Due to the number of people in the emergency room and a concern that the man might become violent when awakened, the agents coordinated with emergency room staff to have the man taken into the emergency room via the ambulance entrance.</span></p>
<p><span>Upon arrival at the ambulance entrance, one of the agents attempted to wake the man to no avail. Emergency room medical staff were called to the Border Patrol vehicle and were unable to locate a pulse. The man was moved to a gurney by medical staff, with assistance from the agents, and the man was transported into the emergency room. Despite lifesaving efforts, the man was pronounced deceased by medical staff at 6:38 p.m.</span></p>
<p><span>The Maricopa County Medical Examiner’s Office performed an autopsy on January 15, 2023. The final cause and manner of death are pending further investigation including toxicology testing.</span></p>
<p><span>CBP's Office of Professional Responsibility special agents reviewed incident driven video recording system footage captured by a body worn camera of one the agents who transported the man to the hospital. The footage captured Abrazo medical personnel and agents removing the unresponsive man from the Border Patrol vehicle, placing him on a stretcher and moving him into the emergency room. OPR special agents noted what appeared to be signs of postmortem change indicating the individual may have been deceased prior to arriving at the hospital.</span></p>
<p><span>256. <strong>Unknown<br/>Age: Unknown<br/>Nationality: El Salvador<br/>Cause of Death: Fatal Car Crash<br/>Incident Date: January 8th, 2023<br/>Incident Location: Santa Teresa, New Mexico</strong></span></p>
<p><span>On January 8, 2023, at approximately 10:50 p.m., Border Patrol agents working approximately five miles north of the Santa Teresa Port of Entry in Santa Teresa, New Mexico, observed a white Nissan Sentra sedan, suspected of human smuggling, travel east on Strauss Road. Another agent working in the area observed the driver of the Nissan Sentra turn north onto Pete Domenici Highway. The agent followed the Nissan Sentra in an unmarked Border Patrol vehicle and notified sector communications, via his service radio, that he would initiate a vehicle stop on Pete Domenici Highway, near mile marker five. The Nissan Sentra slowed and rolled through the red light at the intersection of Airport Road and Pete Domenici Highway and continued north while accelerating. Reportedly, the agent came to a stop at the intersection, checked for cross traffic, then activated his lights and siren and attempted to perform a vehicle stop, but the driver of the Nissan Sentra failed to yield.</span></p>
<p><span>Approximately one mile north of the intersection, the driver of the Nissan Sentra lost control of the vehicle, spun across the highway median, and collided into a concrete barrier on the opposite side of the highway. The pursuing agent reported the Nissan Sentra had traveled far enough ahead of him that he did not observe the Nissan Sentra lose control. The agent requested emergency medical services respond to the scene. Additional agents arrived on scene and began life saving measures on the occupants of the vehicle.</span></p>
<p><span>A total of ten occupants were in the Nissan Sentra. Eight occupants, including the driver, were transported to local area hospitals and two occupants were declared deceased on scene. Three occupants were in the trunk and seven in the passenger compartment of the vehicle during the collision. One deceased occupant was ejected from the trunk and discovered in the roadway. The second deceased occupant was located in the rear passenger side seat. The deceased passengers were identified as a citizen of Mexico and a citizen of the Republic of El Salvador.</span></p>
<p><span>Customs and Border Protection’s Office of Professional Responsibility special agents and Dona Ana County Sheriff’s Office responded and processed the scene of the collision. The investigators determined the Nissan Sentra traveled from the northbound lanes of Pete Domenici Highway, through the median, and across the southbound lanes of the highway, leaving approximately 400 feet of tire marks before it collided with a concrete barrier.</span></p>

<p><span>On December 30, 2022, at approximately 6:30 a.m., Border Patrol agents assigned to the El Paso Sector Intelligence Unit Evidence Collection Team encountered a male subject approximately four miles northeast of the Bridge of Americas, near El Paso, Texas. The male, a United States citizen, was walking in the middle of Airway Boulevard unclothed from the waist down and posing a traffic hazard to traveling vehicles. Intelligence Unit agents approached the man in their unmarked vehicle, with their emergency lights activated, but the man refused to leave the roadway. Intelligence Unit agents handcuffed the man, removed him from the roadway and sat him down in a nearby restaurant parking lot.</span></p>
<p><span>Intelligence Unit agents requested the assistance of the El Paso Police Department and El Paso Fire Department Emergency Medical Services at approximately 6:37 a.m. The agents noticed the man became unresponsive, conducted two sternum rubs with no response and began to administer CPR on the man. The El Paso Fire Department arrived on scene at approximately 6:45 a.m. and assumed primary lifesaving efforts on the man. Fire department personnel requested the Intelligence Unit agents start chest compressions as they attempted to intubate the man. While attempting the intubation, EMS personnel extracted a small plastic “baggie” from the man’s  mouth. Agents secured it in an evidence bag. El Paso Fire Department EMS transported the man to University Medical Center while the Intelligence Unit agents followed the ambulance to the medical center to obtain fingerprints from the man.</span></p>
<p><span>The man arrived at the medical center at approximately 7:10 a.m. and was declared deceased by medical staff a short time after arrival.</span></p>

<p><span>On September 28, 2022, a Border Patrol agent driving an unmarked U.S. Border Patrol vehicle was traveling westbound on US Highway 90 toward the Uvalde Border Patrol Station immigration checkpoint, located approximately 9.7 miles west of Uvalde, Texas. At approximately 5:54 p.m., the agent observed a black Toyota Tacoma pickup truck drive through a ranch fence gate near the eastbound lanes of US Highway 90, approximately eight miles west of Uvalde. The agent observed the pickup truck drive recklessly into the median, onto US Highway 90, and proceeded eastbound toward Uvalde. The agent broadcasted over his service radio he observed multiple occupants inside the pickup truck and requested Uvalde Border Patrol Station contact the Uvalde County Sheriff’s Office along with the Uvalde Police Department to intercept the pickup truck. The Border Patrol agent additionally requested available units from several locations to respond to the intersection of US Highway 481 and US Highway 90 to get behind the vehicle. The agent turned his vehicle around and followed the pickup truck eastbound for approximately one mile before the pickup truck slowed and veered to the shoulder of the highway. The agent activated the vehicle’s emergency lights and reported the pickup truck then re-entered the eastbound lanes of US Highway 90 and continued toward Uvalde at a high rate of speed. The agent followed behind the pickup truck, broadcasting over his service radio the direction of travel and the location of the pickup truck as it passed known landmarks.</span></p>
<p><span>A Uvalde Police Department officer responded to assist on US Highway 90, between Dunbar Lane and the Uvalde County Fairgrounds, approximately three miles west of Uvalde. The Uvalde Police Department officer reported he observed the pickup truck with front-end damage approaching his location and observed a vehicle with red and blue emergency lights following behind the pickup truck. The police officer successfully deployed a Uvalde Police Department issued tire deflation device and the Border Patrol agent reported he received a thumbs up signal from the Uvalde police officer, indicating it was a successful deployment. At approximately 5:59 p.m., the agent broadcasted over his service radio that the pickup truck was spiked and was passing the Uvalde Cemetery, located within the city limits.</span></p>
<p><span>A second Border Patrol agent, driving a marked U.S. Border Patrol vehicle, observed the pickup truck traveling east past the intersection of US Highway 90 and US Highway 481 at a high rate of speed. The second agent turned onto US Highway 90 behind the pickup truck with his vehicle’s emergency lights activated. The agent later informed other Border Patrol agents, via radio, he was unable to maintain a visual due to the high rate of speed the pickup truck was traveling.</span></p>
<p><span>Shortly after the pickup truck drove past the intersection of US Highway 481 and US Highway 90, a Texas Department of Public Safety trooper traveling westbound on US Highway 90 observed the pickup truck traveling on the median of US Highway 90 being pursued by a U.S. Border Patrol vehicle with its emergency lights activated. The Texas trooper activated his emergency equipment, performed a U-turn to assist the Border Patrol agent, and followed behind the marked U.S. Border Patrol unit continuing eastbound on US Highway 90 driving toward Uvalde.</span></p>
<p><span>At approximately 6 p.m., agents reported they lost sight of the suspect pickup truck. Approximately one minute later, an agent reported the pickup truck was involved in a three-vehicle collision with a semi-tractor trailer and a Dodge Dakota truck at the intersection of Getty and Main streets in Uvalde. Within seconds, agents requested emergency medical services respond to the scene. At approximately 6:03 p.m., Uvalde EMS and the Uvalde Fire Department arrived on scene and began rendering aid to injured individuals.

<p><span>On September 25, 2022, a Border Patrol agent assigned to the Uvalde Border Patrol Station and two Army National Guardsmen on federal duty were conducting freight train inspections at Yucca Siding in Knippa, Texas, approximately 14 miles northeast of Uvalde, Texas. The National Guardsman observed several suspected migrants on the east bound freight train at approximately 6:14 a.m. and broadcasted the sighting over his issued Border Patrol service radio. The agent responded to the train siding to inspect the train. The agent located and apprehended a man with his wife and child a short time later. The Border Patrol agent requested a transport vehicle to respond to Yucca Siding to assist with the apprehended migrants. One National Guardsman stayed with the three migrants awaiting the transport vehicle while the agent and the other guardsman continued searching for more migrants along the south side of the train while inspecting the grain hoppers. The National Guardsman then observed suspected migrants running along the top of the grain hoppers toward the rear of the train.  </span></p>
<p><span>As the agent and the guardsman approached the rear of the train on foot, the agent transitioned to the north side of the tracks to determine if the migrants dismounted the train on the north side. The guardsman observed suspected migrants dismount the train on the south side of the tracks and run towards U.S. Highway 90, which is approximately 107 feet from the train tracks. A short time later, the agent and the guardsman heard a loud crash and observed a vehicle come to a stop on the highway. The agent and the guardsman responded to the location and observed an injured man on the side of the road. The agent used his cellular phone to call the Uvalde Border Patrol Station to request emergency medical services at approximately 6:34 a.m. The agent, who is a certified Emergency Medical Technician, performed CPR on the man while awaiting EMS. The agent stopped CPR, ran back to his USBP vehicle, retrieved an automated external defibrillator and returned to the accident scene.

Agents placed the woman, who was unresponsive but breathing, inside an air-conditioned Border Patrol vehicle and utilized cold wet garments to attempt to cool her down while awaiting EMS.</span></p>
<p><span>Medical personnel from American Medical Response EMS arrived on scene and took over medical care at approximately 1:07 p.m. AMR transported the woman to the Yuma Regional Medical Center in Yuma, Arizona at approximately 1:13 p.m. The woman was subsequently admitted into the medical center while under Customs and Border Protection hospital watch.</span></p>
<p><span>On September 3, 2022, the woman was processed in accordance with CBP guidelines, released from CBP custody, and remained at the medical center in critical condition. On September 7, 2022, the woman succumbed to her ailments and was declared deceased by medical personnel. </span></p>
<p><span>241. <strong>Unknown</strong><strong><br/>Age: Unknown<br/>Nationality: US Citizen<br/>Cause of Death: Medical<br/>Incident Date: September 1st, 2022<br/>Incident Location: Lewinston, New York</strong></span></p>
<p><span>On September 1, 2022, at approximately 9:19 p.m., a vehicle arrived from Canada at the Lewiston-Queenston Bridge in Lewiston, New York. The driver of the vehicle, a U.S. citizen, could not find his identification to provide to the Customs and Border Protection officer working the primary inspection lane. The officer allowed him to search for his passport in the trunk of his vehicle, but he was unable to locate it. </span></p>
<p><span>While he was looking in the trunk, a second officer approached with his canine partner. Unable to locate his identification in the trunk, the man then walked to the rear passenger door, leaned into the vehicle, and began searching. The officer then instructed him to get back in his vehicle. The individual then walked around the front of the vehicle and entered the officer’s inspection booth, rather than his car. The officer then called for other officers to assist.</span></p>
<p><span>Two other officers, who were in proximity of the primary lane, responded at approximately 9:22 p.m. and escorted the man to the CBP medium secondary inspection building. Once inside, officers had him sit down on a long row of connected metal chairs in the waiting room lobby where he continued to wait and answer questions from officers located behind a plexiglass divider on the other side of a counter.</span></p>
<p><span>The man quickly placed both of his hands on his head at approximately 9:27 p.m., began to yell incoherently, fell from the chair and began to writhe on the ground. Officers on the other side of the secured counter noticed the man in distress and entered the medium secondary waiting room to check on him approximately 15 seconds later. He stopped moving approximately one minute later. </span></p>
<p><span>One officer checked the man’s pulse while another officer immediately requested emergency medical services at approximately 9:28 p.m. Officers continued to monitor the man while they awaited EMS’ arrival. The man became agitated approximately three minutes later and began to move around on the ground while officers monitored his actions. This continued for approximately five minutes until officers observed him kicking his legs, causing his body to hit the metal waiting room chairs and his head to hit the floor. A total of five officers then turned him over onto his stomach and handcuffed his hands behind his back to prevent him from injuring himself. The officers picked the man up off the floor after a few minutes and sat him in a recovery position on the metal chairs. He continued to yell incoherently and rock back-and-forth while officers continued to prevent him from injuring himself by supporting his head when necessary.</span></p>
<p><span>An acting supervisory officer, trained in the administration of medication designed to reverse an opioid overdose, administered a dose of Naloxone at approximately 9:45 p.m. into the man’s right nostril. The same supervisory officer administered a second dose of Naloxone into his left nostril approximately two minutes later. The man became calmer and more alert shortly after the second dose of Naloxone was administered but continued at times to yell incomprehensibly and rock back and forth on the metal chairs. He again began to writhe uncontrollably on the metal chairs and fell to the floor and lost consciousness approximately 15 minutes after the second dose of Naloxone. Officers monitored his condition as he continued to breathe on his own.</span></p>
<p><span>Upper Mountain Volunteer Fire Department EMS arrived at approximately 10:02 p.m. and immediately assumed primary care of the man. Officers removed the handcuffs at approximately 10:06 p.m., while EMS continued to provide primary care. EMS transported him to the Mount Saint Mary’s Hospital at approximately 10:08 p.m. and medical personnel declared the man deceased shortly after their arrival at the hospital.</span></p>
<p><span>Officers conducted a search of the man’s vehicle and discovered several substances, including one vial containing a white powdery substance that field-tested positive for cocaine. The unknown substances will be tested by a CBP laboratory.</span></p>
<p><span>240. <strong>Unknown</strong><strong><br/>Age: Unknown<br/>Nationality: Guatemala<br/>Cause of Death: Fatal Car Chase<br/>Incident Date: August 18th, 2022<br/>Incident Location: Santa Teresa, New Mexico</strong></span></p>
<p><span>On August 15, 2022, at approximately 4:45 a.m., U.S. Border Patrol agents driving unmarked vehicles were conducting anti-smuggling operations in Santa Teresa, New Mexico, when they observed a Ford Escape and an Acura sedan sitting stationary at a green traffic light on Industrial Road. The vehicles turned left onto Pete V Domenici Highway. A few minutes later, the Border Patrol agents observed the same two vehicles parked next to each other in the parking lot of a FedEx warehouse and suspected the vehicles were engaged in smuggling activities. The agents parked at a separate nearby warehouse and radioed their location and the location of the two suspicious vehicles to other agents in the area. A Supervisory Border Patrol agent driving an unmarked vehicle entered the FedEx parking lot, obtained the license plate numbers of the two vehicles and requested records checks on the Acura’s New Mexico license plate.  El Paso Sector Communications informed the supervisory agent that the license plate was registered to a Honda. The Ford Escape had temporary paper license plates; both switching license plates and temporary paper plates are commonly used tactics by smugglers. The agents then observed both the Acura and Ford pass their location travelling westbound on Strauss Road followed by the supervisory agent. The supervisory agent passed the Acura and Ford because they were traveling slowly then observed in his rear-view mirror that both vehicles turned around and went east on Strauss Road. The suspect vehicles continued eastbound to the intersection of Pete V Domenici Highway and turned north.</span></p>
<p><span>Border Patrol agents in a single unmarked vehicle were traveling ahead of the Acura and the Ford on Pete V Domenici Highway and observed a Lincoln Sport Utility Vehicle driving northbound near the intersection of Airport Road. The agents noticed the Lincoln SUV appeared to be heavily loaded which led agents to believe the vehicle was also possibly involved in smuggling. They called another Border Patrol agent in a marked vehicle via radio to conduct a traffic stop on the Lincoln SUV. The agent, who was accompanied by two agent trainees in the marked vehicle, and one unmarked vehicle conducted a traffic stop on the Lincoln SUV on Pete V Domenici Highway, approximately one quarter mile west of the New Mexico/Texas state border. The traffic stop resulted in the arrest of seven undocumented migrants and two smugglers. While assisting on the stop, the agents in the unmarked vehicle observed the Acura and Ford pass by their location and began to follow the vehicles.</span></p>
<p><span>The Ford Escape and the Acura sedan came to a stop at a traffic light at the intersection of Artcraft-Ord Gary Road and Upper Valley Road in El Paso, Texas, at approximately 5:29 a.m. There are four eastbound traffic lanes at this intersection,. As the vehicles waited at the traffic light, the Acura was in the left lane, and the Ford was stopped in the middle lane, with agents in unmarked vehicles in front of, behind, and on its passenger side. There were no other vehicles in front of the unmarked Border Patrol vehicle located on the passenger side of the Ford Escape.</span></p>
<p><span>As the vehicles were stopped at the intersection, two agents from the unmarked vehicles positioned in front of and behind the Ford exited their vehicles in plain clothes with no visible law enforcement markings and approached the Ford to ascertain if the driver was smuggling undocumented migrants. The driver of the Ford Escape suddenly maneuvered the vehicle to the right and impacted the front bumper of the driver’s side of the unmarked Border Patrol vehicle that was on the Ford Escape’s passenger side. The Ford continued driving southbound on Upper Valley Road at a high rate of speed. The two agents returned to their vehicles to follow the Ford, however, the agents observed brake lights in the distance and then lost visual contact. The agent in the unmarked vehicle impacted by the Ford pulled to the side of the road, inspected the damage to the front of his vehicle and then continued southbound on Upper Valley Road. The other agents drove southbound on Upper Valley Road searching for the Ford Escape.</span></p>
<p><span>An agent observed tire tracks in the dirt shoulder of Upper Valley Road at approximately 5:31 a.m., roughly 1,175 feet south of the intersection of Artcraft-Ord Gary Road and Upper Valley Road. The tire marks continued east into a canal near the intersection of Via de Los Arboles and Upper Valley Road and indicated that the Ford crossed the northbound lane and continued into a canal. The agent exited his vehicle and observed the Ford in the canal half submerged under water but could not reach the vehicle due to the canal’s steep embankment. The agent immediately requested Emergency Medical Services and other agents to assist with the single vehicle crash.</span></p>
<p><span>EMS arrived on scene soon after and rescued injured occupants from the submerged Ford. A passenger, later identified as a citizen of Guatemala, had been ejected from the Ford Escape and was subsequently pronounced deceased at the scene by the El Paso County Justice of the Peace. The driver and six remaining passengers sustained injuries and were transported by EMS to various hospitals in El Paso.</span></p>
<p><span>239. <strong>Unknown</strong><strong><br/>Age: Unknown<br/>Nationality: Guatemala<br/>Cause of Death: Drowning<br/>Incident Date: August 2nd, 2022<br/>Incident Location: Los Ebanos, Texas</strong></span></p>
<p><span>On August 2, 2022, at approximately 5:53 a.m., Border Patrol Agents received a report of multiple groups of suspected undocumented migrants in an area known as Avocado Landing, located east of El Faro Road near Los Ebanos, Texas. Three agents responded to the area and conducted a foot search around 5:57 a.m.</span></p>
<p><span>Agents apprehended eight undocumented migrants; however, several other individuals fled towards the river. Upon securing the undocumented migrants, agents searched for additional migrants and encountered about ten more individuals alongside the riverbank at approximately 6:26 a.m. As the Border Patrol agents began sending the migrants to other agents to be secured, they heard screaming in the river. The agents called for support, which resulted in the deployment of a rescue flotation device.</span></p>
<p><span>An agent took the rescue device, ran towards the river and reported he did not hear anyone screaming and could not see anyone due to the darkness. The agent repeatedly threw the flotation device toward the area of the screaming but the person did not resurface.</span></p>
<p><span>Vessels from the U.S. Coast Guard and Texas Parks and Wildlife Department searched the river and a man’s body was recovered at approximately 9:10 a.m. The decedent was later identified as a citizen of Guatemala.</span></p>
<p><span>238. <strong>Unknown</strong><strong><br/>Age: Unknown<br/>Nationality: US Citizen<br/>Cause of Death: Fatal Car Chase<br/>Incident Date: July 28th, 2022<br/>Incident Location: Arizona</strong></span></p>
<p><span>On July 28, 2022, at approximately 1:09 p.m., a Cochise County Sheriff’s Office deputy attempted to conduct a traffic stop on a vehicle with a temporary license plate on Davis Road near mile marker 18 between the towns of Tombstone and McNeal, Ariz.; the vehicle failed to yield. The sheriff’s deputy stopped the pursuit due to the driver’s erratic driving and issued a be-on-the-lookout bulletin for the vehicle to county-wide law enforcement agencies.</span></p>
<p><span>The Willcox, Ariz., U.S. Border Patrol Station broadcast the search for the vehicle over the service radio at approximately 2:26 p.m.  Two Border Patrol agents in separate vehicles were at a nearby checkpoint and observed the vehicle traveling north on SR 90 at approximately 3:37 p.m. The agents confirmed it was the same vehicle that fled earlier in the day and one agent passed the vehicle on SR 90 to prepare a vehicle immobilization device for deployment in case the vehicle again failed to yield. The second agent continued to follow the vehicle on SR 90. A third agent driving an unmarked Border Patrol vehicle joined behind the vehicle and the marked Border Patrol vehicle a short time later. The agents then attempted to stop the vehicle by activating their emergency lights near mile marker 294 on SR 90, but the vehicle failed to yield and fled from the agents at a high rate of speed. </span></p>
<p><span>The first agent, who initially traveled  further north to wait for the vehicle, positioned himself near Whetstone Ranch Road and deployed a vehicle immobilization device, which successfully contacted the vehicle, but the driver continued driving north on SR 90. The primary pursuing agent’s vehicle dropped out of the pursuit after inadvertently contacting the immobilization device, which caused damage to a tire. The third agent took over the primary pursuit position with his emergency lights and siren activated. A Supervisory Border Patrol Agent terminated the pursuit at approximately 3:47 p.m. due to it approaching the city of Benson.</span></p>
<p><span>The pursuing agent de-activated his emergency equipment and, shortly thereafter, observed an unmarked Benson Police Department vehicle ahead of him activate its emergency lights in an attempt to stop the suspect vehicle. The Border Patrol agent then reactivated his emergency lights and, almost simultaneously, the suspect vehicle collided with a GMC Yukon near the intersection of SR 90 and Village Loop. Both the local police department vehicle and Border Patrol vehicle stopped at the scene of the crash, provided assistance and requested emergency medical services. </span></p>
<p><span>The Benson Fire Department and the Arizona Department of Public Safety arrived on scene a short time later. The driver of the vehicle, a United States citizen, was transported via Life Flight air ambulance to the Banner University Medical Center in Tucson, Ariz. Health Care Innovations EMS arrived at the scene and medical personnel declared the male passenger of the suspect vehicle, a United States citizen, deceased. Health Care Innovations EMS transported two undocumented migrants to the Benson Hospital where they were treated for minor injuries and then released to the Willcox Border Patrol Station.  </span></p>

<p><span>On July 27, 2022, at approximately 4:05 a.m., a Border Patrol agent driving an unmarked U.S. Border Patrol vehicle was conducting roving patrol duties on New Mexico Highway 9 and observed a Tahoe driving westbound near mile marker 144. The agent observed the vehicle drive past his location heading eastbound on HW 9 and the vehicle appeared to be carrying more weight than when he initially observed it. The agent proceeded to follow the vehicle and noticed that it was driving slower than the normal rate of speed for the highway.</span></p>
<p><span>The agent continued following the vehicle for approximately two miles, towards the intersection of HW9 and Pete Domenici Boulevard. Just before arriving at the intersection, the agent attempted to stop the vehicle by activating his unmarked Border Patrol vehicle’s emergency lights at approximately 4:37 a.m., but the driver of the Tahoe turned north on Pete Domenici Boulevard. The vehicle continued driving at the speed limit but ignored the agents emergency lights, so the agent activated his vehicle’s siren and the driver of the vehicle accelerated, failed to yield, and continued driving north on Pete Domenici Boulevard. Due to the high rate of speed the vehicle was going, the agent deactivated his vehicle’s emergency lights and siren and discontinued following the vehicle but continued driving north on Pete Domenici Boulevard.</span></p>
<p><span>A Supervisory Border Patrol agent driving an unmarked vehicle was monitoring the radio communications and was driving in the vicinity of Pete Domenici Boulevard and Strauss Road. The supervisory agent observed the suspect vehicle approaching behind him and decided to turn east on Airport Road to avoid the suspect vehicle. The driver of the suspect vehicle also turned east on Airport Road and continued to drive behind the supervisory agent. The driver of the suspect vehicle drove around the supervisory agents vehicle utilizing the shoulder lane and continued driving eastbound on Airport Road at a high rate of speed. The supervisory agent continued driving east on Airport Road and did not activate his Border Patrol vehicle’s emergency equipment. The supervisory agent observed a cloud of dust and vehicle headlights pointing up at approximately 4:41 a.m..</span></p>
<p><span>The supervisory agent immediately requested emergency medical services and the assistance of other agents in the area due to what he believed was a vehicle accident. When he arrived at the intersection of Airport Road and McNutt Road he observed the suspect vehicle in a ravine on the side of the road and realized that power lines were down across the road due to having struck a utility pole. Additional agents arrived at the crash site and blocked traffic to prevent civilians from striking the downed power lines.</span></p>
<p><span>A short time later, the Sunland Park Fire Department, EMS, and Border Patrol Search Trauma and Rescue agents arrived on the scene and started tending to the injured occupants of the vehicle. There were a total of 13 suspected undocumented migrants in the suspect vehicle. EMS Medics transported four migrants to the Las Palmas Medical Center in El Paso, Texas, for further medical evaluation and additional medics transported six migrants to the University Medical Center in El Paso, Texas. One migrant was uninjured and transported to the Santa Teresa Border Patrol station. Two migrants trapped underneath the suspect vehicle, both citizens of Mexico, were declared deceased on the scene by EMS medical personnel.</span></p>

<p><span>On July 22, 2022, Border Patrol agents assigned to the All-Terrain Vehicle Unit from the Deming, New Mexico Border Patrol Station were following foot tracks in a secluded area in the Deming station’s area of responsibility. One of the agents observed an individual walking towards him, who informed the agent that a migrant from his group needed help and proceeded to guide the agent to an area near Inmon Road and Brazil Road, approximately 16 miles northeast of the Columbus Port of Entry where the man was located. </span></p>
<p><span>Once at the location, the agent saw a juvenile male, citizen of Mexico, lying on the ground having difficulty breathing and foaming at the mouth. The agent immediately requested Emergency Medical Services and assistance from the other agents in the area. The agent poured water on the juvenile’s head and laid him on his side to prevent him from choking as they waited for EMS.</span></p>
<p><span>The Deming Police Department, the Luna County Sheriff’s Office, and Columbus Fire EMS arrived at the location a short time later. Columbus Fire EMS assessed the juvenile and secured him on a backboard to evacuate him out of the area. To expedite his evacuation, agents transported the juvenile on their ATV to the ambulance. Columbus Fire EMS transported the juvenile to Mimbres Memorial Hospital in Deming, New Mexico. While at the hospital, medical personnel determined the juvenile needed advanced medical treatment and he was subsequently transferred to the University Medical Center in El Paso, Texas. The juvenile was admitted to the hospital while in U.S. Customs and Border Protection custody.</span></p>
<p><span>The juvenile was processed in accordance with CBP guidelines, released from CBP custody and remained at University Medical Center in critical condition on July 23, 2022.

<p><span>234. <strong>Unknown</strong><strong><br/>Age: Unknown<br/>Nationality: Guatemala<br/>Cause of Death: Drowning<br/>Incident Date: July 9th, 2022<br/>Incident Location: Rio Grande, Texas</strong></span></p>
<p><span>On July 9 at approximately 4:07 a.m., a Border Patrol agent operating a surveillance camera system notified the local Border Patrol sector that a group of migrants was making illegal entry into the U.S., approximately one-half mile southeast of the Rio Grande Port of Entry near Rio Grande City, Texas, where the Los Olmos Creek flows into the Rio Grande River.</span></p>
<p><span>Three agents and a Border Patrol canine responded to the area. The canine handler and his detection canine encountered a group of four migrants. The group ran east and entered the Los Olmos Creek, which is an approximately 30-35-foot-wide body of water, surrounded by a steep embankment that drops into a muddy creek covered by very large reeds.</span></p>
<p><span>After they entered the water, two of the migrants swam across the Los Olmos Creek, one of the migrants swam back to the bank of the creek and was subsequently apprehended by Border Patrol. The fourth migrant, later identified as a male citizen of Guatemala, struggled to stay afloat.The canine handler detached the 15-foot leash from his dog, waded into the creek, and attempted to rescue the man from drowning by throwing the leash to him. Another agent held out a carrizo cane reed from the bank for the man to grab. A third agent used his flashlight to illuminate the area. </span></p>
<p><span>A Border Patrol watch commander arrived, saw the other agents attempting to rescue the migrant, and then ran approximately 100 yards back to his vehicle to grab a rescue floatation device. The man was unable to grab either the canine leash or the carrizo cane and he sank below the surface of the water before the watch commander was able to return. </span></p>
<p><span>Customs and Border Protection’s Office of Professional Responsibility special agents interviewed the migrants involved in the incident. None of them could recall the man’s name, but all gave a similar description of his clothing and approximate age and recalled that he was a citizen of Guatemala. All of the migrants indicated they encountered Border Patrol agents and attempted to abscond. One of the migrants indicated she saw the man in the water struggling, and attempted to rescue him but could not. She also said that the responding agents tried to rescue him by throwing what she believed to be a rope multiple times, but the man ultimately went under the water and did not resurface.</span></p>
<p><span>CBP was informed by the Rio Grande City Fire Department on July 12 that on July 11 they recovered a male body near the mouth of the Los Olmos Creek. The recovered body matched the description provided by the other migrants. The man was identified by a Government of Guatemala identification card issued in his name and bearing his photo located on his person. CBP met with the three migrants apprehended at the time of the incident on July 13, and when CBP presented a photo of the deceased, all three of the migrants identified him as the man from their group.</span></p>

<p><span>On June 30, at approximately 8:28 a.m., a Jeep Wrangler circumvented the United States Border Patrol checkpoint, located at mile marker 29 of Interstate Highway 35, using the west access road of IH-35. A Border Patrol agent parked on the west access road between mile markers 30 and 31 heard a report of the Jeep Wrangler via radio and within a few minutes, the vehicle passed the Border Patrol agent’s location. The agent observed a male driver, who appeared to be the vehicle’s sole occupant. The agent, operating a marked U.S. Border Patrol vehicle, followed the Jeep Wrangler northbound on the west access road. The Jeep Wrangler turned onto a dirt road, referred to by agents as the Cerrito Alleyway, and the agent observed the driver stop at a gate and briefly converse with an individual. The driver of the Jeep Wrangler continued towards the west access road, where the agent was stopped. The Jeep Wrangler stopped at the agent’s location and the agent lowered his window, asking the driver if he needed any assistance. </span></p>
<p><span>The driver of the Jeep Wrangler indicated he was looking for a wildlife safari. The agent got out of the US Border Patrol vehicle and approached the man to assist. As the agent approached, the man drove forward and nervously repeated that he had missed his exit and needed to go. The man drove away and the agent observed that the vehicle appeared to be riding low, as though it contained heavy cargo. The agent followed the vehicle onto the west access road and the Jeep Wrangler began to speed away from the agent.</span></p>
<p><span>At approximately 8:34 a.m., the agent activated his vehicle’s overhead lights and siren to conduct a traffic stop, but the driver of the Jeep Wrangler failed to yield, and a pursuit ensued northbound on the IH35 west access road. The agent notified a supervisor of the pursuit and reported speeds of approximately 90 mph as the pursuit continued northbound on the west access road. </span></p>
<p><span>At approximately 8:36 a.m., the Jeep Wrangler crossed IH-35 at the mile marker 32 underpass and merged onto northbound IH35 via the east access road. Border Patrol agents asked dispatch to request assistance from the Texas Department of Public Safety and the Encinal Police Department.</span></p>
<p><span>The agent pursued the Jeep Wrangler northbound on IH35, reporting that the vehicle was traveling over 100 mph in light traffic. As the agent traveled between mile markers 36 and 37, he reportedly lost sight of the Jeep Wrangler and slowed down. As the agent traveled over the mile marker 39 overpass, he observed a dust cloud in the parking lot of the Loves Travel Stop, located on the east access road and Highway 44 in Encinal, Texas. The agent immediately reported that the Jeep Wrangler was involved in a collision and requested Emergency Medical Services. </span></p>
<p><span>U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s Office of Professional Responsibility special agents reviewed video footage of the collision which revealed the following: At approximately 8:39 a.m., the Jeep Wrangler exited IH35 at mile marker 39 while traveling at a high rate of speed. The driver of the Jeep Wrangler failed to negotiate the exit ramp, lost control and struck the rear of the tractor trailer parked at the Loves Travel Stop. Approximately 14 seconds later, the first Encinal Police Department vehicle arrived on scene. At the time of the police department’s arrival, the pursuing Border Patrol agent’s vehicle can be seen traveling past the collision scene on the northbound lanes of IH35. Approximately 62 seconds later, the first U.S. Border Patrol vehicle arrived at the scene.</span></p>
<p><span>The Jeep Wrangler was found to contain a total of seven occupants. Four of the vehicle’s occupants were fatally injured, including two adult male citizens of Mexico, one adult citizen of Guatemala, and one unidentified individual. The driver of the Jeep Wrangler, a United States citizen, suffered head trauma and was airlifted to the University Medical Center in San Antonio, Texas. Additionally, one adult male Guatemalan citizen was airlifted to University Medical Center, and another adult male Guatemalan citizen was transported to the Laredo Medical Center. </span></p>
<p><span>Texas Department of Public Safety assumed lead of the accident investigation and Homeland Security Investigations has initiated a criminal investigation against the driver of the Jeep Wrangler.</span></p>
<p><span>This incident is being investigated by the Texas Department of Public Safety and reviewed by CBP’s OPR. The Department of Homeland Security’s Office of Inspector General was notified of the incident.</span></p>

<p><span>On June 8, a Border Patrol agent assigned to the El Paso U.S. Border Patrol Station was working line watch duties when he observed four suspected migrants running north from the Rio Grande River towards the International Border Barrier, approximately one and a quarter miles east of the Paso Del Norte Port of Entry in El Paso, Texas. The International Border Barrier is situated between the U.S./Mexico international border and the American Canal. The Border Patrol agent drove his U.S. Border Patrol marked vehicle on the levee road towards the location from the south side of the barrier and saw two individuals running back south towards the Rio Grande River. The agent ran through the open barrier gate, and observed one of the individuals struggling in the canal due to the strength of the current. The agent immediately requested assistance from the El Paso Fire Department and broadcasted a request for a rescue rope via radio communications to the Border Patrol agents near the location. The nearest U.S. Border Patrol water rescue equipment box was inaccessible to the agent due to the box being situated on the north side of the canal and approximately a tenth of a mile away from the agent’s location. The Border Patrol agent briefly searched for the second individual in the water, but he did not see the second individual. The agent continued to walk along the edge of the canal, monitoring the individual in the water until additional agents arrived.</span></p>
<p><span>Within approximately four minutes of the radio communication requesting assistance, two additional agents arrived at the location and met with the Border Patrol agent who was monitoring the individual in the water. The individual, later identified as a male citizen of Mexico, was floating face down in the canal, continuing to be swept away by the current. Agents deployed their rescue ropes but were unsuccessful in retrieving the man. A short time later, El Paso Fire Department arrived and entered the canal with the assistance of the agents. El Paso Fire Department pulled the man out of the canal and initiated CPR with the assistance of a certified Emergency Medical Technician Border Patrol agent. El Paso Fire Department Rescue Five EMS arrived at the location and took over life saving measures on the man. El Paso Fire Department Rescue Five EMS personnel determined the man required further medical care and transported him to the University Medical Center in El Paso. The man was admitted into the medical center and was moved into the intensive care unit while under U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s hospital watch.</span></p>
<p><span>On June 9, the man was processed in accordance with CBP guidelines and released from CBP custody but remained at University Medical Center. Later that day, the man succumbed to his ailments and was declared deceased by medical center personnel.</span></p>
<p><span>The El Paso County Office of the Medical Examiner and CBP’s Office of Professional Responsibility are reviewing this incident. The Department of Homeland Security’s Office of Inspector General was also notified.</span></p>

<p><span>On April 15, 2022, at approximately 4:11 a.m., a Border Patrol agent assigned to the primary inspection booth at the Las Cruces, N.M. Border Patrol checkpoint observed a vehicle approach the checkpoint, located at mile marker 120.5 on Interstate 10 west near Las Cruces, N.M. The agent observed the suspect vehicle pull off the road and park near the license plate readers, approximately five hundred feet from the checkpoint’s primary inspection booth. The agent notified two other agents inside the inspection building of the suspect vehicle via the checkpoint’s intercom system. </span></p>
<p><span>The driver of the suspect vehicle remained parked for approximately two minutes. The primary agent then observed the suspect vehicle turning around and he immediately advised the two other agents. The agents left the inspection building and entered a marked Border Patrol vehicle. They saw the suspect vehicle heading east onto the ramp toward I-10. As the agents approached I-10 in the Border Patrol vehicle, they observed the taillights of the suspect vehicle driving in the westbound lanes against traffic.</span></p>
<p><span>Shortly after the agents observed the suspect vehicle driving against traffic, they activated their emergency equipment and entered the median between the east and westbound lanes to catch up to the suspect vehicle. The agents were not able to get to the suspect vehicle due to the rough conditions of the median. The agents then activated their emergency siren to get the driver’s attention. A short time later, the suspect vehicle struck another vehicle. The collision sent the subject vehicle into the median between the east and west bound lanes, where it came to a stop. The other vehicle crossed the westbound lanes, stopped on the north shoulder, and caught fire.</span></p>
<p><span>The agents arrived at the location of the accident and parked their Border Patrol vehicle across the west bound lanes of I-10 to control the flow of traffic. One agent ran to the other vehicle and observed the driver to be seriously injured and lifeless underneath the deployed airbags. However, with the vehicle catching fire, he was unable to render aid or remove the driver from the vehicle. Another agent approached the suspect vehicle, and upon his arrival saw the driver was partially ejected from the vehicle and unresponsive. The agent broke the rear window and determined there were no other passengers in the vehicle. The agents requested New Mexico State Police, Dona Ana County Fire Department and Emergency Medical Services to respond to the scene.  </span></p>
<p><span>Dona Ana County Fire Department arrived at the scene and extinguished the vehicle fire. New Mexico State Police arrived at the scene and closed the I-10 westbound lanes to initiate their investigation. New Mexico State Police investigators determined the lack of skid marks from the vehicles indicated that neither vehicle braked prior to impact. The New Mexico Office of the Medical Investigator arrived on the scene and declared both drivers deceased. </span></p>

<p><span>On Feb. 1, 2022, at approximately 3:17 p.m. PST, a Border Patrol remote camera operator spotted three individuals cross the border barrier and enter the All-American Canal, approximately two-tenths of a mile east of the Calexico East Port of Entry in Calexico, Calif.  The camera operator relayed the information via radio to a Border Patrol agent who responded to the area.The camera operator informed the Border Patrol agent that one of the suspected undocumented individuals exited the water on the north side of the canal, one was standing on the bank on the south side of the canal, and one was in the water in the center of the canal. Approximately 23 seconds later, the camera operator reported that the individual in the middle of the canal was not advancing and that he was not sure if the individual was struggling. Approximately 15 seconds later, the individual on the north side of the canal fled north as the Border Patrol agent arrived. The Border Patrol agent observed the individual in the middle of the canal, noted that he did not appear to be in distress, so he proceeded to apprehend the migrant who ran north. During this time, the individual on the south bank of the canal returned to Mexico. After the apprehension, and approximately 55 seconds after he arrived in the area, the Border Patrol agent asked the camera operator about the condition of the man in the middle of the canal and inquired if he was still struggling.  The camera operator replied that he was not sure if the individual was struggling and would need to zoom the camera to get a better look.  After doing so, the camera operator relayed that the migrant in the middle of the canal appeared to be struggling to stay afloat.  Within seconds, the Border Patrol agent returned to the canal bank to help the migrant. As the Border Patrol agent arrived, he asked the migrant if he needed help, to which the migrant responded “yes.” Before the Border Patrol agent was able to deploy a rescue device, the migrant sank below the surface of the water. The Border Patrol agent threw a flotation device to the area where the migrant was last seen, but the migrant never resurfaced.  Customs and Border Protection’s Office of Professional Responsibility special agents reviewed radio traffic and video footage of the incident and interviewed the apprehended migrant. The apprehended migrant stated that he did not know the migrant who drowned, that they had only met prior to crossing the border barrier, and that he saw the Border Patrol agent throw a flotation device to the migrant in the water.</span></p>

<p><span>On Nov. 21, 2021, at approximately 1:53 p.m., a Supervisory Border Patrol Agent encountered a group of twelve migrants approximately one mile south of La Joya, Texas.  The migrants were walking along an unimproved roadway and turned themselves in to the SBPA.  Upon initial contact with the SBPA, one of the female migrants immediately requested medical assistance for her son, a four-year-old male citizen of Honduras.  The woman, also traveling with her five-year-old son, told the SBPA that her four-year-old son was sick and having difficulty breathing. The SBPA, a certified Emergency Medical Technician, assessed the child who was handed to him by the mother.   </span></p>
<p><span>The SBPA observed the child did not appear to have a fever, but noticed the boy having difficulty breathing. The SBPA asked the mother how long her son had been sick, and the mother replied he had been sick for a couple of weeks and had a history of renal failure.  Utilizing a stethoscope to listen to the boy’s breathing, the SBPA could hear crackling and wheezing, and noted he could have fluid in his lungs and possibly have pneumonia. </span></p>

<p>Approximately twenty minutes later, while processing the second group, the Border Patrol agent observed one of the migrants from the first group, a fifteen-year-old female citizen of Honduras, unwrapping her baby from a blanket and attempting to wake the baby. The Border Patrol agent asked the female if anything was wrong, and the female told the Border Patrol agent her baby was sick with a cough. The Border Patrol agent continued with processing the second group when she observed the female was still checking on the baby and was talking to another female from her group who was also checking the baby. The Border Patrol agent once again asked the female what was wrong and if the baby was okay and the female responded she was checking to see if her baby was breathing. The Border Patrol agent approached the female and observed the baby was wrapped in two blankets and was dressed in a onesie and was wearing a beanie.</p>
<p>The Border Patrol agent checked the baby’s cheek and chin which were warm, but the baby did not respond to her touch. The Border Patrol agent observed the baby’s fists were clenched and discoloration of the baby’s fingernails. The female informed the Border Patrol agent her seventeen-day-old son, a citizen of Mexico, was coughing and had not eaten all day. The Border Patrol agent immediately called a Supervisory Border Patrol Agent and requested a Border Patrol Emergency Medical Technician; however, there were no EMTs on duty. The supervisory agent requested that another Border Patrol agent transport the mother and baby to the hospital. At approximately 7:42 p.m., due to the urgency of the situation and to ensure clear communications, another Border Patrol agent called 911 via cell phone and requested Emergency Medical Services for the baby. To ensure the baby received medical treatment as quickly as possible, the Border Patrol agent transported him and his mother in a Border Patrol vehicle approximately four-and-half miles to a convenience store located on Military Highway and 10th Street, in McAllen, Texas, to meet EMS.</p>
<p>At approximately 7:45 PM, the McAllen Fire Department arrived at the convenience store and attempted to resuscitate the baby. At approximately 7:50 p.m., Med Care EMS arrived at the location and joined efforts to resuscitate the baby. Med Care EMS subsequently transported the baby and his mother to the Rio Grande Regional Hospital in McAllen, TX.</p>
<p>At approximately 8:21 p.m., the baby arrived at Rio Grande Regional Hospital where medical personnel continued life saving measures. Approximately nineteen minutes after arriving at the hospital, the baby was declared deceased by medical personnel.</p>

<p>On November 18, 2021, a Border Patrol agent assigned to the Weslaco, Texas, Border Patrol station apprehended two migrants, a husband and wife from Venezuela, near Progreso Lakes, Texas. At approximately 7:14 p.m., the two migrants were transported to the Hidalgo Port of Entry for initial processing. Approximately an hour and a half later, the migrants were transported to the U.S. Border Patrol Centralized Processing Center in McAllen, Texas, for further processing and detention. The woman advised U.S. Border Patrol at both locations she was six months pregnant.</p>
<p>On Nov. 19, 2021, at approximately 5:40 a.m., Customs and Border Protection-contracted medical personnel conducted an initial medical screening of the woman. The woman did not complain about abdominal pain during her initial screening. At approximately 8:40 a.m., a Customs and Border Protection-contracted Physician’s Assistant (PA) conducted another medical screening of the woman after she requested medication for high blood pressure. The PA noticed the woman’s blood pressure was slightly elevated and the woman told the PA she was experiencing a light discharge. The PA felt the woman’s stomach and observed there was no movement from the baby. The woman told the PA she had not felt her baby move for several days. The PA requested the woman be taken to the hospital for further evaluation.</p>
<p>At approximately 9:15 a.m., the woman was transported to the South Texas Health Systems Emergency Room where she was evaluated by medical personnel. While at South Texas Health Systems, medical personnel were unable to find the baby’s heartbeat and recommended the woman be transported to the McAllen Medical Center. At approximately 1:07 p.m., the woman was admitted into the McAllen Medical Center, and medical personnel induced labor. At approximately 2:37 p.m., the woman delivered a child with no heartbeat and medical personnel declared the child deceased. Medical personnel estimated the child was approximately 23 weeks along.</p>

<p><span>On Nov. 12, 2021, an Infiniti sedan, followed by a Toyota Camry, arrived at a U.S. Border Patrol checkpoint on State Route 83, near Sonoita, Ariz.  A Border Patrol Agent working the primary inspection area noticed people laying down in the backseat area of the Infiniti and referred the vehicle to the secondary inspection area.  The Infiniti accelerated quickly and fled the checkpoint. A Border Patrol Agent working in the secondary inspection area attempted to activate a remote Vehicle Immobilization Device to disable the vehicle’s tires.  However, the remote VID failed to deploy, and the Infiniti left the checkpoint area at a high rate of speed.</span></p>
<p><span>As the Infiniti fled the area, the Toyota backed away from the primary inspection area, drove over the orange traffic cones into the southbound lane, and continued north circumventing the checkpoint.  The Border Patrol Agent in the primary inspection area deployed a VID but was unable to determine if the VID affected the Toyota’s tires. The Toyota also continued north on SR 83 at a high rate of speed. </span></p>
<p><span>The Border Patrol Agent in the secondary inspection area got in his marked Border Patrol vehicle and drove north on SR 83.  Approximately four miles north of the checkpoint, on a curve in the road, the Border Patrol agent found the Toyota Camry resting on its roof in the northbound lane of SR 83 perpendicular to the path of travel, facing east. The Border Patrol agent radioed for emergency medical personnel. </span></p>
<p><span>The Sonoita-Elgin Fire Department arrived at the scene and declared a male citizen of Mexico, and a second male, whose identity has not yet been confirmed, deceased.

Agents entered the residence with the State Trooper and confronted the subject [who] appeared to be holding a bolt-action rifle. The State Trooper and BP agent discharged their weapons at the subject. The subject was struck by some of the rounds fired, and collapsed to the floor. EMS arrived and transported the subject to a local hospital for emergency treatment and later transported by life-flight to a hospital in Bangor, Maine. The subject died the next morning. The Maine State Attorney General’s report later found that Agent Robert Kipler fired 14 shots, and Kipler fired the fatal shot.
