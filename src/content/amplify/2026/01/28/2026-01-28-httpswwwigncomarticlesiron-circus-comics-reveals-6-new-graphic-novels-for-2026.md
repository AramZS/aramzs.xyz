title: Iron Circus Comics Reveals 6 New Graphic Novels for 2026
---
<p>The comic book industry is nothing if not a volatile place in 2026, particularly in light of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-hero-worship-diamond-comic-distributors-bankruptcy-bad-news">Diamond Comics' bankruptcy last year. </a>It falls on smaller publishers to find new and creative ways of getting their books to market, and that's something that Iron Circus Comics has always specialized in. They've built an entire publishing company on the back of crowdfunding, and they'll continue to expand in the new year.</p>
<p>IGN can exclusively reveal Iron Circus' crowfunding slate for 2026. Scroll down to learn about six new graphic novels launching in the coming months, covering everything from fantasy to sci-fi to relationship drama.</p>
<h2 data-cy="title2">Sleeping Wizards</h2>

<h2 data-cy="title2">Runaway to the Stars</h2>

<p><strong>Creative Team:</strong> Cartoonist Jay Eaton</p>
<p><strong>Launch Date:</strong> April 2026</p>
<p><em>Find where you belong in the stars - Talita is an alien raised by humans and nothing fits. Her quarters aren't big enough, her food isn't quite right, and she is either walked all over or told she is too scary. All that changes when a rogue AI from a salvage ship wants her help getting back into space. </em></p>
<p>“RUNAWAY TO THE STARS is the culmination of over a decade of science fiction worldbuilding, character development, hard work, research, and love. I'm thrilled for it to finally be taking flesh as a book with Iron Circus.” -Eaton</p>
<h2 data-cy="title2">The Goblin Throne</h2>
<p><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/27/not-final-goblin-throne-cover-1769529085166.jpg"><figure><img alt="" data-cy="progressive-image" src="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/27/not-final-goblin-throne-cover-1769529085166.jpg?width=628&amp;dpr=2&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;quality=80" srcset="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/27/not-final-goblin-throne-cover-1769529085166.jpg?width=628&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;quality=80 1x, https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/27/not-final-goblin-throne-cover-1769529085166.jpg?width=628&amp;dpr=2&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;quality=80 2x"/></figure></a></p>
<p><strong>Creative Team:</strong> Cartoonist Melanie Gillman</p>
<p><strong>Launch Date:</strong> June 2026</p>
<p><em>What forbidden terrors await in the woods? - Looking upon the Goblin Queen will lead to your doom, even if she offers to take you as her bride. For once the deal is struck, she will insist you belong to her sooner or later. It is only a matter of waiting for her. </em></p>
<p>“Iron Circus has always been an unparalleled champion of weird, horny, queer comics, and I could not imagine a better home for this book — my weirdest, horniest, and queerest comic yet. This is no feel-good gay romance — it’s a bloody adult fairy tale about divorced moms and craven lesbian desire, and the horror of finally having a real, honest love within your grasp, if only a little murder hadn’t gotten in the way first.” -Gillman</p>

<p><strong>Creative Team: </strong>Cartoonist SE Case</p>
<p><strong>Launch Date:</strong> October 2026</p>
<p><em>S.E. Case’s beautifully drawn RIGSBY WI is a refreshingly genuine tale of life on the cusp of something new, and the saga continues here with Book 3.</em></p>
<p>“I've been doing RIGSBY WI as a webcomic series for 6 years, so it’s been really cool working with Iron Circus to bring it to print for the first time. The third installment in the series, Flux is a story of bad teen relationships, picturesque walks in the woods, poorly thought out metaphors, and rural queerness — one that I hope offers catharsis to readers who have experienced something similar.” -Case</p>

<p>"I am incredibly excited about our Kickstarter line-up for 2026,” said Iron Circus founder Spike Trotman in a statement. “It's an almost perfect cross-section of what I love about running a publisher like ICC. Unhinged fantasy, hard-sci-fi in its feelings, ultra-relatable slice-of-life. The kind of comics we want to make are stories that stick with you by creators who know how to make you care, and 2026 is us rolling a natural 20 on that. I've never been prouder of a KS line-up."</p>
