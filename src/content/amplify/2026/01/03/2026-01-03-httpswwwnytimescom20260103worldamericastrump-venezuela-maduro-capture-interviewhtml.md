<p><i><p><i>By </i><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/tyler-pager">Tyler Pager</a></p><blockquote><p>Reporting from West Palm Beach, Fla.</p></blockquote></i></p>
<p>President Trump sounded tired.</p>
<p>It was just after 4:30 a.m. Saturday morning and 10 minutes after he announced on social media that the United States had captured Nicolás Maduro, the leader of Venezuela. I had called the president to try to better understand what happened and what comes next. He picked up after three rings and answered a few questions.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump first celebrated the mission’s success.</p>
<p>“A lot of good planning and lot of great, great troops and great people,” he told me. “It was a brilliant operation, actually.”</p>
<p>I then asked if he had sought congressional authority before the U.S. military, along with law enforcement personnel, engaged in a “large scale strike,” as he put in on social media.</p>
<p>“We’ll discuss that,” he said. “We’re going to have a news conference.”</p>
<p>In his social media announcement, Mr. Trump said he would speak at 11 a.m. from Mar-a-Lago, his private club and residence where he has spent the past two weeks.</p>
<p>I tried to ask what he envisions next for Venezuela and why the high-risk mission was worth it.</p>
<p>“You’re going to hear all about it 11 o’clock,” he said before hanging up.</p>
<p>The call had lasted 50 seconds.</p>
