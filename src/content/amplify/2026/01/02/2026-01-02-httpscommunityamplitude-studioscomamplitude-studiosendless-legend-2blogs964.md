<div><div _ngcontent-sc155=""><p>Hello everyone,</p><p><br/></p><p>And welcome to our first look at one of the factions of Endless Legend 2. Though they are newcomers to Saiadha, they may feel familiar to long-time fans of the Endless universe: The Kin of Sheredyn.</p><p><br/></p><p><span><div class="rw-embed-wrapper"><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yA5CHDSTdT8?autoplay=0&amp;mute=0" type="video/mp4"/></div></span><br/></p><h1>History</h1><p><span>The Kin of Sheredyn are strangers to Saiadha, second generation descendants of an expedition sent by a mighty interstellar empire.</span></p><p>They arrived on the ocean planet decades ago to explore the planet and found a new colony, but instead found themselves stranded on an island. Between devastating storms and relentless necrophage attacks, the planet had turned out to be far more dangerous than they had expected.</p><p>To make matters worse, their charismatic leader, Commander Garin, disappeared many years ago while exploring ancient ruins of the Endless. Since then, she has become a near mythical figure to many Kin, who believe that she will return to save them.</p><p><br/></p><p><img alt="Kin_Ilustration.jpg" src="https://medias.games2gether.com/forums/daarkarrow/Kin_Ilustration-1.jpg"/></p><p><img alt="text divider.png" src="https://medias.games2gether.com/forums/daarkarrow/text_divider-4.png"/></p><p><span><br/></span></p><p><span>Art</span></p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b><img alt="KinofSheredyn_Leader.jpg" src="https://medias.games2gether.com/forums/daarkarrow/KinofSheredyn_Leader-3.jpg"/></b></p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><span><br/></span></p><p><span>VISUAL INSPIRATIONS</span></p><p><br/></p><p>As the Kin are an offshoot of important and canonic factions in the Endless Universe, there were a lot of questions as to how to treat them visually. Given that they are expansionists and colonizers in space, we needed to find an analogous style on Saiadha.</p><p>The art style that worked the best turned out to be a mixture of three forms/</p><ul><li>Simplified Greco-Roman classicism</li><li>Mid-twentieth century Constructivist brutalist</li><li>Subtle &amp; elegant Science Fantasy visual tropes</li></ul><p>For the military units, the artists leaned towards the Roman and Greek armies of the classical period.</p><p>While the buildings became large, solid forms with classical touches.</p><p><br/><img alt="KinSketches.jpg" src="https://medias.games2gether.com/forums/daarkarrow/KinSketches.jpg"/></p><p><br/></p><h3>NOTABLE ELEMENTS<br/><br/></h3><p><span>Noble knight in shining armor and Modern elements</span></p><p>Their superior technology is visible. Mix of the noble knight cliche and some modern elements. Modern cuts, shapes and pattern.</p><p><br/><img alt="KinSketches2.jpg" src="https://medias.games2gether.com/forums/daarkarrow/KinSketches2.jpg"/></p><p><br/></p><h3>TECHNOLOGY<br/><br/></h3><p>Technology is treated almost as magic. Artifacts are elegant with few hint of function.</p><p>Martial, structured, brutal</p><p>Use hint of roman influences to represent the structure of their society.</p><p><br/><img alt="KinOfSheredyn.jpg" src="https://medias.games2gether.com/forums/daarkarrow/KinOfSheredyn.jpg"/></p><p><img alt="text divider.png" src="https://medias.games2gether.com/forums/daarkarrow/text_divider-3.png"/></p><p><span>Gameplay</span></p><p><br/></p><p>The Kin of Sheredyn are an excellent faction to begin exploring Endless Legend 2, as (unlike some of the other factions) they engage with all gameplay systems while offering a defensive builder playstyle. They excel at developing their territory through strong industry and defending it with both tough fortifications and a disciplined military. As the game progresses, they also gain access to powerful special units and abilities that they can use in their territories.</p><p><br/><img alt="Séquence imbriquée 01 Copier 01_6.gif" src="https://medias.games2gether.com/forums/daarkarrow/Séquence_imbriquée_01_Copier_01_6.gif"/></p><p><span><br/></span></p><h3>Faction Affinity: Devout Force</h3><p><br/></p><p>As the Kin develop the fortifications of their cities, they will increase their “<b>Strength of Our Zeal</b>” gauge. At certain thresholds, this will unlock both passive bonuses and powerful “<b>Holy Commandment</b>” active abilities. </p><p><br/></p><p>The bonuses for high “Strength of Our Zeal” gauge will give broad economic output bonuses to your Keeps, making them useful for more than just defense.</p><p>Holy Commandments, on the other hand, are active abilities that can be used in your own territory, giving you access to powerful effects such as restoring an army to full health or letting it take another action in the same turn.</p><p>The Kin also have access to the Chosen, a powerful mech suit worn by their most elite soldiers. While these suits can turn the tide of battle with their abilities and raw power, the lack of access to the United Empire’s advanced manufacturing facilities means that the Kin can field them only in very limited numbers.</p><p><br/></p><h3>Faction Traits</h3><p><br/></p><ul><li><b>Martial Builders</b>: Experienced military engineers, the Kin can build military improvements more quickly than other factions.</li><li><b>As Was Ordained</b>: The Kin would rather develop their territory than expand further, and gain bonuses for staying under their city cap.</li><li><b>Religious Favor</b>: The Kin receive stronger bonuses and penalties for high or low approval in their cities.</li><li><b>Idol’s Grace:</b> Every hero serving in the Kin of Sheredyn empire increases the Approval of their cities.</li><li><b>Warrior Honor</b>: The Kin believe in honor and justice, so they will support wars they see as justified, but oppose them if they don’t.</li><li><b>Resilient Heart</b>: Kin of Sheredyn troops recover faster in their own territory.<br/><br/><img alt="Archer_UweRach_Small.png" src="https://medias.games2gether.com/forums/daarkarrow/Archer_UweRach_Small.png"/></li></ul><p><span><img alt="text divider.png" src="https://medias.games2gether.com/forums/daarkarrow/text_divider-6.png"/></span></p><p><span><br/></span></p><h1>Military</h1><p><span>Following the military traditions and experience of their ancestors, the Kin field a balanced but resilient force. As long as they stick together, their shields allow them to shrug off attacks and wear down the enemy with minimal losses. They excel at “hammer and anvil” tactics, with Legionaries and Chosen holding down the enemy as archers and cavalry deliver the killing blow. Each of their basic units will be able to pursue one of two upgrade paths, allowing them to specialize in a specific role.</span></p><p><br/><img alt="Kin_Military.png" src="https://medias.games2gether.com/forums/daarkarrow/Kin_Military.png"/></p><p><br/></p><h3>Battle Affinity: Stand United</h3><p><br/></p><p>In battle all units fielded by the Sheredyn will gain a shield that absorbs damage for each allied unit adjacent to them at the end of their turn.</p><p><br/></p><p><b>Sentinels</b> are the scouts of the Kin army, moving quickly in the field and even allowing armies the join to move a little faster.</p><ul><li><span><b>Pathfinders</b> are tough and improve an army’s mobility even more than Sentinels, and can even force enemy units out of position.</span></li><li><span><b>Harassers</b> forego better mobility for a more aggressive stance, dealing damage and weakening enemies.</span></li></ul><p><span><br/></span></p><p><span>The <b>Legionary </b>forms the solid front line of the Kin armies, a tough infantry unit that thanks to their rigorous training receives an even stronger shield from the Stand United Battle Affinity.</span></p><ul><li><span><b>Guardians </b>are the toughest soldiers of your front line. Not only do they gain even stronger shields from being near allies, but they also protect them in turn.</span></li><li><span><b>Custodians </b>are not that much tougher than the basic Legionary, but they have learned to hamper enemy movement to keep them engaged.</span></li></ul><p><br/></p><p><span>Kin <b>Archers</b> are especially effective against enemies already engaged with your other troops.</span></p><ul><li><span>The <b>Bowmasters</b> specialize in bracing themselves for the perfect shot, massively improving their damage output if they do not move.</span></li><li><span><b>Executors</b> can attack the enemy from longer range and weaken their defenses.</span></li></ul><p><span><br/></span></p><p><span><b>Heralds of the Faith</b> serve as shock cavalry, delivering devastating charges to the enemy lines.</span></p><ul><li><span><b>Commanders</b> focus on survivability, improving their own toughness and shielding adjacent allies.</span></li><li><span><b>Champions </b>are more aggressive, delivering even more powerful charges and possibly attacking twice in a turn.</span></li></ul><p><span><br/></span></p><p><span>The <b>Chosen</b> are the most powerful tool in the Sheredyn arsenal. Not only are they resilient and deadly (and can be made even more so through research and upgrades), but they have access to several powerful active abilities in battle, protecting their allies or damaging and weakening their enemies. They also serve as a targeting beacon for the Kin’s <i>Holy Commandment</i> abilities, allowing you to use them outside your territory. However, all this power comes with one major disadvantage: The Kin can field only a limited number of these troops.    </span></p><p><br/></p><h1>Soundtrack</h1><p>We saw a lot of people asking about music all the time and we did not wanted to take the opportunity to share with you the main soundtrack for the Kin of Sheredy. </p><p>Huge work from Arnaud Roy (formerly known as FlyByNo)</p><p><br/></p><p><span><div class="rw-embed-wrapper"><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EV-cbNfUkd0?autoplay=0&amp;mute=0" type="video/mp4"/></div></span><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>Let us know what you think about this first faction!</p><p>We cannot wait for you to try the Kin 🏰</p><p><br/></p><p></p><hr/><p></p><p><br/></p><p><span><img alt="Kin_Infographics.png" src="https://medias.games2gether.com/forums/daarkarrow/Kin_Infographics.png"/></span></p><p> </p></div></div>
