title: 'New Year, New Goals'

<p>Heavily inspired by Simone Giertz's <a href="https://yetch.studio/products/every-day-goal-calendar?">Every day Goal Calendar</a>, I put together a mini app that allows you to create and track your goals daily on ATProto.</p>
<figure><img src="https://sri.leaflet.pub/api/atproto_images?did=did:plc:7gm5ejhut7kia2kzglqfew5b&amp;cid=bafkreiguys25p5jv7m2huhdb5265xuwfbs3p7izcxlzuil7g557o3tlsc4"/><figcaption>It works exactly how you expect:</figcaption></figure>
<p>You get to see the full year view of your goal, so you can watch your streak grow (and feel the pressure to not break it).</p>
<p>Since everything in ATProto is public, the real goal is social accountability. Your friends/followers can see your streaks (or lack thereof) and they will either get inspired or jump in to keep you on track.</p>
<p>I didn't get a chance to test this out fully yet like I usually do. It's very much in alpha. So bugs are expected. <a href="https://goals.garden/did:plc:7gm5ejhut7kia2kzglqfew5b/goal/636c450e-1de3-4f67-93ba-19b7d69c0b72">My first published goal</a> is to write daily this year, so getting this out early.</p>
<p>Give it a try, feedback welcome.</p>
<p>Some notes:</p>
<p>I've kept the goal completion lenient for the month of January (might extend) since the app is pretty new and would not be nice for people who haven't discovered this app yet but did complete their goals.</p>
<p>After that, the app allows a 48 hour time window for each date, to mark your daily goal as completed.</p>
<p>There are many themes/shapes/emojis to choose. Pick one based on your goal.</p>
