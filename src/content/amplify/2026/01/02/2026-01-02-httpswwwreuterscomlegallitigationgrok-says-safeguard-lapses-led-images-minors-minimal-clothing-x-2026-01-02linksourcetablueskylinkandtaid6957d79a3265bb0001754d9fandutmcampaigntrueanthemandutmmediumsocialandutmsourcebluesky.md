<p>Jan 2 (Reuters) - Elon Musk's xAI artificial intelligence chatbot Grok said on Friday lapses in safeguards had resulted in "images depicting minors in minimal clothing" on social media platform X and that improvements were being made to prevent this.</p>
<p>Screenshots shared by users on X showed Grok's public media tab filled with images that users said had been altered when they uploaded photos and prompted the bot to alter them.</p>
<p>"There are isolated cases where users prompted for and received AI images depicting minors in minimal clothing," Grok said in a post on X. "xAI has safeguards, but improvements are ongoing to block such requests entirely."</p>
<p>"As noted, we've identified lapses in safeguards and are urgently fixing them—CSAM is illegal and prohibited," Grok said, referring to Child Sexual Abuse Material.</p>
<p>Grok gave no further details.</p>
<p>In a separate reply to a user on X on Thursday, Grok said most cases could be prevented through advanced filters and monitoring although it said "no system is 100% foolproof," adding that xAI was prioritising improvements and reviewing details shared by users.</p>
<p>When contacted by Reuters for comment by email, xAI replied with the message "Legacy Media Lies".</p>
