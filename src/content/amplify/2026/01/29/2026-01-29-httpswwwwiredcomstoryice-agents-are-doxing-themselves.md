title: ICE Agents Are ‘Doxing’ Themselves

<p>The alleged risks of being publicly identified have not stopped DHS and ICE employees from creating profiles on LinkedIn, even as Kristi Noem threatens to treat revealing agents' identities as a crime.</p>

<p>Last week, a website called ICE List went viral after its creators <a data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.instagram.com/p/DTZSOOqivrh/"}' data-offer-url="https://www.instagram.com/p/DTZSOOqivrh/" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DTZSOOqivrh/">said</a> that they had received what they described as a leak of personal information about nearly 4,500 <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/dhs-data-grab-getting-citizens-kicked-off-voter-rolls/">Department of Homeland Security</a> employees. However, a WIRED analysis of the site found that the database relies heavily on information that apparent DHS employees have posted publicly online themselves. This comes at a time when DHS has characterized reporting on or publicizing the identity of ICE officers as “doxing” and has <a data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://oregoncapitalchronicle.com/2025/10/16/ice-vowed-doxing-charges-against-portland-anarchists-months-later-no-cases-filed/"}' data-offer-url="https://oregoncapitalchronicle.com/2025/10/16/ice-vowed-doxing-charges-against-portland-anarchists-months-later-no-cases-filed/" href="https://oregoncapitalchronicle.com/2025/10/16/ice-vowed-doxing-charges-against-portland-anarchists-months-later-no-cases-filed/">threatened to prosecute</a> perceived offenders to the fullest extent of the law.</p>
<p>ICE List operates as a crowdsourced wiki maintained by volunteers, who have discretion over who is added and what is marked as “verified.” Like Wikipedia, with which it has no affiliation, ICE List has category pages that feature a link to every page included in that category. Not everyone on the list is an ICE employee or even affiliated with a federal agency; former Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio, for example, whom DHS <a data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.wral.com/news/ap/656f6-fact-focus-former-proud-boys-leader-falsely-identified-as-an-ice-officer/"}' data-offer-url="https://www.wral.com/news/ap/656f6-fact-focus-former-proud-boys-leader-falsely-identified-as-an-ice-officer/" href="https://www.wral.com/news/ap/656f6-fact-focus-former-proud-boys-leader-falsely-identified-as-an-ice-officer/">told the Associated Press</a> is not an ICE agent, is included in the wiki’s “Agents” category. On his actual page, his “Agency” is listed as “N/A” and his “Role” is listed as “Propagandist; Agitator.” (Tarrio <a data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://x.com/NobleOne/status/2011576303317549180"}' data-offer-url="https://x.com/NobleOne/status/2011576303317549180" href="https://x.com/NobleOne/status/2011576303317549180">posted</a> on X that he wished he worked for ICE, but called the ICE List page disinformation.)</p>
<p>Dominick Skinner, the owner of ICE List, says he does not believe that what ICE List does is doxing. ICE List doesn’t post the home addresses of identified agents, and says on its About page that “false submissions, harassment, or attempts to misuse the platform will be removed.”</p>
<p>“If this were doxing, then we dox ourselves by simply being present in online environments,” Skinner says, “which is just rather ridiculous.”</p>
<p>WIRED reviewed individuals’ pages that were included in the “Agents” category on ICE List as of January 22. Of the 1,580 pages, nearly 90 percent mention LinkedIn as a source of information, though some of the links cited now appear to be broken, and not all of the links support claims made on the wiki. (Someone listed as “active” on ICE List may, for example, have a LinkedIn depicting them as a former legal advisor for ICE. On its About page, ICE List says that “errors may occur.”) Other linked profiles lack photos and don’t appear to be very active. Some of the links, however, appear to match federal immigration agents who have previously been named in official ICE press releases and court records.</p>
<p>Like other LinkedIn users, those who self-identify as ICE deportation officers and other types of DHS employees are in many cases posting New Year’s resolutions, reacting to meandering motivational posts about the meaning of leadership, and letting people know they’re #opentowork.</p>
<p>The DHS did not respond to requests for comment.</p>
<p>Some individuals’ pages on the ICE List wiki cite <a data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://openpayrolls.com/"}' data-offer-url="https://openpayrolls.com/" href="https://openpayrolls.com/">OpenPayrolls</a>, a searchable database of public employees’ salaries that includes some ICE employees, and <a data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"http://www.signalhire.com/companies/u-s-immigration-and-customs-enforcement-ice/employees"}' data-offer-url="http://www.signalhire.com/companies/u-s-immigration-and-customs-enforcement-ice/employees" href="http://www.signalhire.com/companies/u-s-immigration-and-customs-enforcement-ice/employees">SignalHire</a>, a data broker that specializes in lead generation, as sources of information.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for OpenPayrolls wrote in an email that it has no affiliation with ICE List and that the ICE-related payroll records on its site were released by the US Office of Personnel Management in response to a Freedom of Information Act request. The spokesperson also said, “To date, we have not received outreach from any government agency expressing concerns regarding the display of public records on our transparency website.”</p>
<p>SignalHire did not respond to a request for comment, but it also includes direct links to the LinkedIn profiles of people representing themselves as ICE officers on its website.</p>

<p>There’s no fancy trick to finding ICE officers on LinkedIn. WIRED was able to surface hundreds of profiles belonging to people who say they are ICE employees by simply clicking the “Show more results” button on the “People” tab of ICE’s LinkedIn page. LinkedIn did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>In press releases, media interviews, and in court, Trump administration officials have said repeatedly that ICE agents and their families are at risk of being doxed. In October, a DHS press release <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/news/2025/10/09/dhs-condemns-dangerous-doxxing-and-escalating-threats-against-federal-law">said</a> that ICE officers were “facing a more than 1000% increase in assaults against them and their families are being doxxed and threatened online.”</p>
<p>Last week, DHS secretary Kristi Noem admonished a CBS News journalist <a data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/kristi-noem-face-the-nation-transcript-01-18-2026/"}' data-offer-url="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/kristi-noem-face-the-nation-transcript-01-18-2026/" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/kristi-noem-face-the-nation-transcript-01-18-2026/">interviewing</a> her for saying the name of <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ice-agent-jonathan-ross-renee-good-shooting-firearms-trainer-testimony/">Jonathan Ross</a>, a deportation officer in ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations division who shot and killed Minneapolis woman Renee Nicole Good. Federal officials <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ice-agent-jonathan-ross-renee-good-shooting-firearms-trainer-testimony/">aided</a> the identification of Ross, apparently inadvertently, by telling news outlets that the officer, who hadn’t yet been identified, had been previously dragged by a car during an immigrant enforcement operation in June. (“DHS will never confirm or deny attempts to dox our law enforcement officers,” DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin told WIRED earlier in January in response to questions about Ross. “Doxing our officers put their lives and their families in serious danger.”)</p>
<p>As part of their duties, ICE deportation officers are <a data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://ice.usajobs.gov/job/853993800#joa-duties"}' data-offer-url="https://ice.usajobs.gov/job/853993800#joa-duties" href="https://ice.usajobs.gov/job/853993800#joa-duties">expected</a> to support prosecutions or administrative actions by helping prepare investigative reports. Like other deportation officers, Ross has given court testimony and <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ice-agent-jonathan-ross-renee-good-shooting-firearms-trainer-testimony/">submitted declarations</a> to support court cases, including the one linked to the incident during which he was dragged. Court filings that detail his appearances in court and his written declarations are a matter of public record.</p>
<p>Agents also have their own responsibilities when it comes to maintaining their online presence. Independent journalist Ken Klippenstein has <a data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.kenklippenstein.com/p/immigration-agents-terrified-by-ice"}' data-offer-url="https://www.kenklippenstein.com/p/immigration-agents-terrified-by-ice" href="https://www.kenklippenstein.com/p/immigration-agents-terrified-by-ice">reported</a> on US Border Patrol–branded documents that instruct employees, “Be mindful of what you post on social media.” CBP did not respond to WIRED’s request for comment.</p>
<p>The federal government has used federal agents’ purported fear of doxing as an argument for why they should be allowed to wear masks and other facial coverings, a practice the state of Minnesota has sought to suspend in its lawsuit against Noem in her capacity as secretary of DHS.</p>
<p>In a <a data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mnd.230268/gov.uscourts.mnd.230268.35.1.pdf"}' data-offer-url="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mnd.230268/gov.uscourts.mnd.230268.35.1.pdf" href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mnd.230268/gov.uscourts.mnd.230268.35.1.pdf">declaration</a> filed in the Minnesota lawsuit, Kyle Harvick, a CBP official who oversees Border Patrol operations for El Centro Station in California, said that “the rise of doxing, the advancement of facial recognition technologies, and the proliferation of bad actors on social media has created an unprecedented operational risk for federal law enforcement officers that necessitates appropriate protective steps such as wearing masks in public to protect their identities.”</p>
