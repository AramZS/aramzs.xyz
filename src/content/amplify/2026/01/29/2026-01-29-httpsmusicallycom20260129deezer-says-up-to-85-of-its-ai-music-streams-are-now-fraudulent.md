<p><img alt="" src="https://i0.wp.com/musically.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EN-PR_1200X600.png?fit=780%2C390&amp;ssl=1"/></p>
<p>At the start of 2025 there were around 10,000 fully AI-generated tracks being added to Deezer every day, accounting for 10% of all its uploads. By November that had <a href="https://musically.com/2025/11/12/50000-ai-music-tracks-are-now-uploaded-to-deezer-every-day/">ballooned to 50,000 tracks a day and 34% of total uploads</a>.</p>
<p>Time for an update, and yes, <a href="https://newsroom-deezer.com/2026/01/ai-generated-music-deezer-selling-detection-tool/">both figures have grown again</a>. Deezer says it is now receiving more than 60,000 fully-AI tracks every day, and that’s 39% of total uploads. It detected more than 13.4m of these tracks in 2025 as a whole.</p>
<p>There’s more updates where those came from. AI tracks now generate “between 1-3%” of all streams on Deezer, according to the company. That’s a significant increase on <a href="https://musically.com/2025/09/11/deezer-says-28-of-its-new-music-uploads-are-now-ai-generated/">the 0.5% share of total streams they had in September last year</a>.</p>
<p>Deezer also now says that “up to 85%” of these streams were fraudulent – played by bots rather than humans in order to siphon off royalties – in 2025 as a whole. That’s up from 70% last September.</p>
<p>There are positive aspects to the company’s announcement. The scary numbers are being wielded to trumpet Deezer’s success at identifying both the AI-generated tracks and the fraudulent streams.</p>
<p>It doesn’t recommend or playlist the former, and demonetises the latter. And the topical hook for today’s announcement is that Deezer is <a href="https://partners.deezer.com/ai-detection">opening up its detection tool to other services and music companies</a>.</p>
<p>“We’ve seen a great interest in both our approach and our tool, and we have already performed successful tests with industry leaders, including Sacem,” said CEO Alexis Lanternier. “From now on, we are licensing the tech to make it widely available.”</p>
<p>Deezer’s regular release of AI and fraud stats is having a ripple effect within the industry, including with musicians..A survey published this morning by UK collecting society PRS for Music is the latest evidence of that.</p>
<p>It surveyed more than 2,600 of its members, and found that 79% are worried about AI-generated music competing with human work – up from 74% in 2023. The percentage who agree that ‘AI has the potential to negatively affect their livelihoods’ has risen from 69% to 76% in that time.</p>
<p>Importantly, these changes have come as songwriters have learned more about GenAI technology. In 2023, 53% said they understood how AI worked in relation to music creation. Now that stands at 72%.</p>
