  Introducing Osprey V1.0: Open Source Infrastructure for Real-Time Abuse
  Mitigation
---
<figure><img alt="Introducing Osprey V1.0: Open Source Infrastructure for Real-Time Abuse Mitigation" src="https://roost.tools/images/blog-header-osprey-v1-3.png"/></figure>
<p>Today, we’re excited to announce <strong>Osprey V1.0,</strong> <strong>an open source online safety tool designed to help platforms investigate and address their priority threats at scale, without sacrificing data privacy or performance.</strong> A tool originally developed by <a href="https://discord.com/"><strong>Discord</strong></a> and now open sourced through ROOST, <strong>Osprey</strong> <strong>V1.0</strong> processes over 50M events daily in production environments like <strong>Bluesky </strong>and is designed for real-time incident response.</p>
<h2><strong>Meet Osprey V1.0</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://roost.tools/blog/roost-announces-coop-and-osprey-free-open-source-trust-and-safety-infrastructure-for-the-ai-era/">We first announced Osprey</a> in July and rolled out V.0 in October. Since then, ROOST has led a group of contributors from numerous organizations who’ve been working to evolve the codebase into an open source project and into a stable, production-grade release.</p>
<p>Today, we’re excited to say that <a href="https://github.com/roostorg/osprey">Osprey V1.0</a> – a rules engine and investigation tool built to support real-world trust and safety operations – is now ready for teams to use.</p>
<p><strong>Osprey enables you to:</strong></p>
<ul><li><p>Encode and manage nuanced, platform-specific anti-abuse and safety rules</p></li><li><p>Conduct investigations into emerging threats across systems</p></li><li><p>Support human reviewers with structured workflows</p></li><li><p>Respond faster and more effectively to cross-platform harms at scale</p></li><li><p>Retain full control of your data</p></li></ul>
<p>Osprey is designed to be flexible, extensible, and interoperable. It is also able to integrate into existing architecture rather than replace it. More importantly, it is open source with an Apache 2 license. That means any organization can use it for free on their own infrastructure, inspect how it works, adapt it to their needs, and contribute improvements back to the community. Because when it comes to sensitive incident data, people deserve software they can inspect and run without asking for permission.</p>
<h2><strong>Get Started with Osprey</strong></h2>
<p>Whether you’re running a large platform, building a new protocol, or supporting online communities, Osprey helps you automate the obvious and investigate the ambiguous.</p>
<p>Visit <a href="https://github.com/roostorg/osprey/tree/main/docs">Osprey’s “Getting Started” guide</a> to spin up a local instance of Osprey and learn the different investigation and rules enforcement features. To meet others investigating with Osprey, you can join our <a href="https://discord.gg/UXmBqy7kFX">Discord server</a>, or come to a bi-weekly <a href="https://github.com/roostorg/osprey/discussions/categories/announcements">Osprey Working Group meeting</a>.</p>
<h2><strong>Already in Production</strong></h2>
<p>Osprey is already running in production at <strong>Bluesky. </strong>In addition, the refactored open source version has been pulled back into <strong>Discord</strong>, where it is helping teams manage investigations and apply policy at scale.</p>
<p>We are also excited to see <strong>Matrix as an active Osprey user</strong>, where the tool will augment their existing open source ecosystem.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>At Discord, we believe that s</strong><em><strong>afety tools shouldn't be gated by resources.</strong></em> <em>We originally built Osprey to handle the immense scale and complexity <strong>of Discord's ecosystem</strong>, but by open-sourcing it through ROOST, we’ve turned a proprietary tool into a communal force multiplier. Re-integrating the community-enhanced V1.0 back into our own platform has already streamlined our investigations, proving that when we build in the open, the entire internet gets safer. </em></p></blockquote>
<p><em><strong>— Savannah Badalich, Global Head of Product Policy, Discord</strong></em></p>
<blockquote><p><em>Osprey has become a cornerstone of Bluesky's Trust &amp; Safety operations. Understanding threat patterns across a decentralized network is uniquely challenging, but Osprey has given us <strong>real, actionable visibility</strong> across the full threat landscape, from basic spam to sophisticated nation-state influence operations...Unlike traditional moderation solutions, we've been able to <strong>make Osprey truly ours</strong>, building deep integrations with our internal systems and crafting detection logic that matches how threats actually manifest on Bluesky. We're not stuck with out-of-the-box solutions that don't quite fit and we can <strong>adapt the tool to our needs</strong> as they evolve.</em></p></blockquote>
<p><em><strong>– Aaron Rodericks, Head of Trust and Safety, Bluesky</strong></em></p>
<blockquote><p><em>We're delighted to use and to contribute to Osprey as part of our approach to safety for </em><a href="http://matrix.org/">matrix.org</a><em>. It's an <strong>important puzzle piece</strong> in our work to protect our users and the wider Matrix network. Plus, working with the team at ROOST and their growing community has been very fulfilling. Collaborating on safety tooling with our industry peers and the open source community is what we are about!</em></p></blockquote>
<p><em><strong>– Jim Mackenzie, VP of Trust &amp; Safety, The Matrix.org Foundation</strong></em></p>
<h2><strong>See Osprey in Action at FOSDEM During EU Open Source Week</strong></h2>
<p>Taking place during <a href="https://opensourceweek.eu/">EU Open Source Week</a>, <a href="https://fosdem.org/2026/">FOSDEM</a> is a well-known event in Brussels where software developers from around the world meet, share ideas and collaborate. To mark the launch of Osprey V1.0, we’re sharing a live walkthrough of the new powerful rules engine and investigation tool with this important cohort on Sunday, Feb. 1, 2026.</p>
<p>At the event, we’ll showcase:</p>
<ul><li><p>A refresher on what trust and safety work actually entails</p></li><li><p>A demo of Osprey’s rules engine and investigation workflows</p></li><li><p>Examples of how Osprey is used in production today</p></li><li><p>Guidance on how to adopt and contribute to Osprey</p></li></ul>
<h2><strong>Built With the Community, for the Community</strong></h2>
<p>ROOST is a nonprofit guided by the belief that our projects should be governed by the users they serve. Osprey follows that same philosophy and is just one part of <a href="https://github.com/orgs/roostorg/discussions/44">ROOST’s broader effort</a> to build open source trust and safety infrastructure for the internet:</p>
<ul><li><p>Open development and transparent decision-making</p></li><li><p>Community input on features and priorities</p></li><li><p>Shared ownership of critical safety tooling</p></li></ul>
<p>This approach allows platforms, large and small, centralized and decentralized, to collaborate on safety without sacrificing independence or control.</p>
<h2><strong>Why Open Source Safety Infrastructure Matters</strong></h2>
<p>Today, we face an unprecedented state of abuse, and safety teams across organizations are often solving the same problems repeatedly:</p>
<ul><li><p>Translating policies into enforceable rules</p></li><li><p>Managing investigations and evidence</p></li><li><p>Coordinating human review workflows</p></li><li><p>Responding to incidents that span multiple formats, accounts, or channels</p></li></ul>
<p>Safety tooling has been closed and hard-to-access, forcing teams to rebuild basic safety tooling rather than focus on their platform-specific harms and priorities.</p>
<p><strong>ROOST is changing this dynamic.</strong></p>
<p>If you believe that safety tools should be transparent, collaborative, and accessible, and that the future of online safety depends on working together, we invite you to explore <a href="https://roostorg.github.io/osprey/">Osprey</a> and the ROOST ecosystem, including <a href="https://roost.tools/blog/a-new-milestone-for-open-source-safety-infrastructure-and-transparency/">gpt-oss-safeguard</a>. Join us in shaping what comes next by contributing to their development.</p>
