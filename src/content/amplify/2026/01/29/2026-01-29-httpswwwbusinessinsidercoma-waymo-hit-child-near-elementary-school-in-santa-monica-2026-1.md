<p>Federal safety regulators have opened an investigation after a <a data-analytics-post-depth="20" data-mrf-link="https://www.businessinsider.com/robotaxis-viral-in-2025-where-to-ride-waymo-tesla-2026-2025-12" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' href="https://www.businessinsider.com/robotaxis-viral-in-2025-where-to-ride-waymo-tesla-2026-2025-12">Waymo</a> self-driving vehicle hit a child near an elementary school in Santa Monica, California.</p>
<p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said the incident happened on January 23 during morning school drop-off hours, within two blocks of a school.</p>
<p>In its preliminary evaluation, NHTSA said the child ran into the street from behind a double-parked SUV and was hit by the autonomous vehicle, which was operating without a human safety driver.</p>
<p>In a statement published on its website, Waymo said it voluntarily notified NHTSA on the day of the incident and is cooperating fully with the agency's investigation.</p>
<p>Waymo said in its statement that as soon as the <a data-analytics-post-depth="60" data-mrf-link="https://www.businessinsider.com/photos-waymo-future-robotaxi-fleet-ojai-hyundai-zeekr-2026-1" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' href="https://www.businessinsider.com/photos-waymo-future-robotaxi-fleet-ojai-hyundai-zeekr-2026-1">car</a> detected the child, it "braked hard, reducing speed from approximately 17 mph to under 6 mph before contact was made."</p>
<p>The child suffered minor injuries, Waymo reported, according to NHTSA.</p>
<p>NHTSA is now examining whether Waymo's automated driving system exercised appropriate caution in a school zone and how the vehicle responded after the impact.</p>
<p>The investigation comes as Waymo faces heightened scrutiny over the safety of its autonomous vehicles.</p>
<p>In recent months, the company has dealt with a series of incidents, including a crash on Sunday in Los Angeles involving a <a data-analytics-post-depth="80" data-mrf-link="https://www.businessinsider.com/waymo-human-driver-crash-parked-cars-los-angeles-2026-1" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' href="https://www.businessinsider.com/waymo-human-driver-crash-parked-cars-los-angeles-2026-1">Waymo vehicle</a> driven by a human employee and a federal recall in May affecting <a data-analytics-post-depth="80" data-mrf-link="https://www.businessinsider.com/waymo-recall-software-1200-robotaxis-nhtsa-2025-5" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' href="https://www.businessinsider.com/waymo-recall-software-1200-robotaxis-nhtsa-2025-5">more than 1,200 vehicles</a> after robotaxis collided with chains or gates.</p>
<p>Last December, regulators also examined incidents in which Waymo vehicles <a data-analytics-post-depth="100" data-mrf-link="https://www.businessinsider.com/waymo-explains-robotaxis-stalled-san-francisco-power-outage-scale-2025-12" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' href="https://www.businessinsider.com/waymo-explains-robotaxis-stalled-san-francisco-power-outage-scale-2025-12">stalled in busy intersections</a>, disrupting traffic in San Francisco.</p>
