<p>Over the past several days, as reports about <strong>The Washington Post’s</strong> looming layoffs have reverberated throughout the industry, staffers on the newspaper’s sports desk have quietly begun receiving phone calls from the section's leadership. In the private conversations, according to people familiar with them, management has all but encouraged journalists to start looking for jobs elsewhere.

<p><strong><em>Bari’s CBS Buyouts:</em></strong> Just one day after <strong>Bari Weiss</strong> alluded to future cuts as she laid out her vision for the future of <strong>CBS News</strong> to a room full of skeptical staffers, the network offered an unspecified number of buyouts to non-union <strong>“CBS Evening News”</strong> employees,<strong> Variety’s Brian Steinberg </strong><a href="https://variety.com/2026/tv/news/cbs-evening-news-buyouts-bari-weiss-tony-dokoupil-1236643552/">reported</a>.
