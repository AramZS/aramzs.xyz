  Young explained that the word “inn” felt fitting because it’s not a synonym
  for a bar, nor a full restaurant, nor a tavern.

<p>The team behind <a href="https://greenpointers.com/2018/08/13/the-meat-hooks-thursday-summer-bbq-series-is-back/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">The Meat Hook</a> (397 Graham Ave.) and <a href="https://greenpointers.com/2020/09/02/meat-hook-founders-to-open-cozy-royal-next-week/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Cozy Royale</a> (434 Humboldt St.) are set to open a new local haunt. </p>
<p>Peek Inn (38 Driggs Ave.) is opening in the former home of Greenpoint’s <a href="https://greenpointers.com/2025/08/04/greenpoints-fin-du-monde-closing-this-month/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Fin du Monde</a>, a French bistro that opened during the pandemic in 2020 and closed in August 2025.</p>
<p>Peek Inn is different than <a href="https://greenpointers.com/2026/01/13/peek-in-cafe-to-replace-cecily-on-franklin-street/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Peek In Cafe</a> (80 Franklin St.) which is opening soon on the other side of Greenpoint in the former home of <a href="https://greenpointers.com/2025/10/03/franklin-streets-cecily-announces-closure/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Cecily</a>.</p>
<p>Co-owner Brent Young told <em>Greenpointers </em>that he and his team had been brainstorming names since they looked at the space in November. </p>
<p>Young explained that the word “inn” felt fitting because it’s not a synonym for a bar, nor a full restaurant, nor a tavern. Plus, Peekins is a nickname for the dog of Young’s business partner Mike Haigis.</p><p data-block="8" data-code="PGRpdiBjbGFzcz0nY29kZS1ibG9jayBjb2RlLWJsb2NrLTgnIHN0eWxlPSdtYXJnaW46IDhweCBhdXRvOyB0ZXh0LWFsaWduOiBjZW50ZXI7IGRpc3BsYXk6IGJsb2NrOyBjbGVhcjogYm90aDsnPgo8YW1wLWFkIHdpZHRoPTMwMCBoZWlnaHQ9MjUwCiAgICB0eXBlPSJkb3VibGVjbGljayIKICAgIGRhdGEtc2xvdD0iLzIxNjc3ODA2OTcwL2dwX2luY29udGVudF9tb2JpbGVfMiI+CjwvYW1wLWFkPnY8L2Rpdj4K" data-insertion-no-dbg="" data-insertion-position="prepend" data-selector=".ai-insert-8-37175843"></p>

<p>Young explained that the home of his latest project is “a great little hidden corner that felt like you’d peek in to find a seat.”</p>

<p>Young calls Peek Inn the “bar version” of Cozy Royale with a solid beer list, affordable wine and drinks, and some food, though they haven’t solidified a chef and menu yet. </p>
<p>“We’re a corner bar with everything you need, and nothing you don’t. A seat at the bar, friendly faces, drinks and food that don’t drain the wallet,” he told <em>Greenpointers</em>.</p>
<p>Young feels passionate about offering reliable neighborhood options where locals feel at home. “No one wants to invoke <em>Cheers</em>, but we do often, and loudly,” he said.</p>
<p>“With all of our stores or restaurants, we’ve really tried to be part of the area’s fabric,” Young continued. “Trusty options that lead with warmth and personality.”</p>
<p>The team hopes to open Peek Inn in March. They will start with later nighttime hours only, but aim to add afternoon service. </p>
<p>“The city needs more relaxing, inviting bars where someone can have a solitary afternoon drink and kill some hours with a friend or a book,” Young said.</p>
