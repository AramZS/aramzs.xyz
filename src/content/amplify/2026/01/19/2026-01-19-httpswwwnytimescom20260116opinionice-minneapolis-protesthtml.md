<p>The death of Renee Good in Minneapolis has put a spotlight on the aggressive tactics of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents operating in U.S. cities, and it has spotlighted the groups organizing to observe and protest immigration enforcement.</p>
<p>I’m really interested in these small-scale efforts. They have led to people standing on street corners, blowing whistles to alert neighborhoods to ICE’s presence and following and recording agents while they are conducting operations and making arrests.</p>
