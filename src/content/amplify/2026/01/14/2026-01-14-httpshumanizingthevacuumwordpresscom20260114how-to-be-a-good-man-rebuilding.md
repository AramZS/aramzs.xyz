<p>Josh O’Connor needs to stop it with the performances as wonderful as the one in <em>Rebuilding</em> and go away for a while, give other guys a chance. In his <a href="https://humanizingthevacuum.wordpress.com/2025/09/21/the-history-of-sound-hits-one-melancholy-note/">fourth </a>film <a href="https://humanizingthevacuum.wordpress.com/2025/11/28/to-present-not-ask-the-mastermind/">released</a> in a <a href="https://humanizingthevacuum.wordpress.com/2025/12/15/you-gotta-have-faith-wake-up-dead-man/">six-month period</a> the British actor who has mastered several American accents plays Thomas “Dusty” Fraser, a cowboy working odd jobs after fires destroy homes west of the Rockies. He hangs out at a colony of FEMA trailers, making friends with Mali (Kali Reis), whose husband stayed behind to protect their property and hasn’t been seen again, and, in a nod to the title, rebuilding a relationship with school-aged daughter Callie Rose (Lily LaTorre). The setting and taciturn characters may nod towards Sundance fare, but by the half-hour mark <em>Rebuilding</em> acquires unexpected resonance. Writer-director Max Walker-Silverman (A Love Story) gets the small things right. So does O’Connor.</p>
<p>Reminiscent of a Kelly Reichardt film but, thanks to Jake Xerxes Fussell’s songs and score, with the sentimentality as foregrounded as a Paul McCartney bass lines, <em>Rebuilding</em> takes a no-fuss narrative approach. Every character serves its purpose; Walker-Silverman has mastered a narrative shorthand. Alfonso Herrera Salcedo allows himself no banal pictorialism thanks to which audiences are supposed to gape at the Majesty of Nature. A shot of desiccated, charred pines glimpsed through smoke opens the film: there’s your Majesty of Nature. When Dusty tells his trailer park neighbors that they got 10 years, tops, before another fire wipes them out again, Walker-Silverman lets his actors take in this rather unsatisfying thought.</p>
<p>In addition, Walker-Silverman likes his characters. There’s no rancor between Dusty and Callie’s mom Ruby (Meghann Fahy). He gives Ruby’s boyfriend, the suspiciously long-haired Robbie (Sam Engbring) no grief; he even stays close to Ruby’s dying mom Bess (Amy Madigan), partly because she has known Dusty’s family since he was a kid. But Dusty’s new focus is on Callie, and when he isn’t directing cow traffic at intersections he’s taking her to the library because his trailer has no Wifi (they’re not alone: the shack-library parking lot turns into the unofficial towns square for the same reason). “To her you’re reborn,” Ruby cracks, in her only curt moment, after the trip. Meanwhile he starts a kinda-sorta flirtation with Mali and helps the survivors with the byzantine nature of FEMA relief applications.</p>
<p>So little happens of consequence in<em> Rebuilding</em> that to feel a small grin develop as it unfurls feels like a miracle. LaToore gives one of the more treacle-free child performances in recent memory. Free of the ghastly <em>Weapons </em>makeup, Madigan in ten minutes of screen time etches a full life; an expression flickers when she serves Callie homecooked scrambled eggs familiar to anyone who’s had a doting grandmother. Walker-Silverman telegraphs her death with a pillow-shot montage reminiscent of Ozu: the spice garden over her sink she had scrupulously watered, her couch, Callie’s drawings on the fridge. And O’Connor, who can be garrulous in some parts and a model of economy in others, continues to impress. Dusty is a solid man, perhaps a good one, or at least learning to be. We learn Bess has died when after pulling up the house in his truck Dusty takes off his hat on seeing the grief-stricken Ruby on the porch. Dusty may not — yet — be a good man, but he’s a gentleman.</p>
