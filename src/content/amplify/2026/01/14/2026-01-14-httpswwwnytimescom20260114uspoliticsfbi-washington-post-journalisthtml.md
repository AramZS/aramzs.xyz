<p><i><p><i>By </i><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/benjamin-mullin">Benjamin Mullin</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/devlin-barrett">Devlin Barrett</a></p></i></p>
<p>F.B.I. agents searched the home of a Washington Post reporter on Wednesday, as part of what officials said was an investigation into the possible sharing of government secrets, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>The reporter, Hannah Natanson, has spent the past year covering the Trump administration’s effort to fire federal workers and redirect much of the work force to enforcing his agenda. Many of those employees shared with her their anger, frustration and fear with the changes the administration was making.</p>
<p>The Washington Post declined to immediately comment.</p>
<p>Ms. Natanson recently wrote a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/12/24/trump-federal-government-workers/">first-person account of her experience</a> talking to federal employees, quoting some of the messages she received from them.</p>
<p>“I understand the risks,” one Defense Department worker told her. “But getting the truth and facts out is so much more important.”</p>
<p>A Justice Department staff member wrote, “I’d never thought I’d be leaking info like this.”</p>
