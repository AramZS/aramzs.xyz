<p>Google's John Mueller was asked if it was acceptable to link your brand websites together on a brand page to communicate to your users that the company owns multiple brands. John said, it is pretty common to do so and if done as a reasonable scale, it is fine to do.</p>
<p>The question was posted on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/danitsunami.bsky.social/post/3mcdqrm5xi22l">Bluesky</a> and said:</p>
<blockquote>If a series of sister brands/websites wants to let their users know that they are related and owned by a lager company and create a partner page to link between each other, will this run the risk of being spammy under Google's eyes?<p>The business wants to let users know that each brand is related and they are getting the same level of service standards set by the business that acquired them.</p></blockquote>
<p>John Mueller replied on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/johnmu.com/post/3mcel7i7tuc25">Bluesky</a>:</p>
<blockquote>This seems pretty common, I don't see a problem with it when done at reasonable scale. My expectation would be that the site does better overall with a single presence, but splitting shouldn't cause problems.</blockquote>
<p>So yea, this is fairly common amongst larger brands. But he does think it may make sense to put all the sites together in some cases.</p>
<p>I mean, that would depend on the site. If a news organization owns several news properties, those properties would probably need their own brand names and sites.</p>
<p>Back in 2013, Matt Cutts formerly from Google, said <a href="https://www.seroundtable.com/google-linking-many-sites-17093.html">be careful linking too many sites</a> together. The question then was "If I have 20 domains, should I link them all together?" The short answer is, most likely no - you should not link them all together. Then in 2014, he said <a href="https://www.seroundtable.com/google-cctlds-linking-18320.html">be careful linking sister sites together</a>. But I guess the advice has changed since then...</p>
