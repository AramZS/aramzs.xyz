<p>Kathleen Kennedy admits that, in her tenure as president of Lucasfilm, not everyone loved everything. She acknowledges that some <em>Star Wars</em> fans just want <a href="https://gizmodo.com/kathleen-kennedy-gives-some-intriguing-star-wars-movie-updates-after-her-lucasfilm-exit-2000710897">the same thing over and over</a>. And, often, those fans can <a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-washington-posts-analysis-of-star-wars-toxic-fandom-1828856645">be overly vocal about it.</a> Nevertheless, she’s 100% behind every movie and show she made… with one exception.</p>
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/01/kathleen-kennedy-exit-interview-1236665253/">Deadline</a> as she <a href="https://gizmodo.com/dave-filoni-lucasfilm-kathleen-kennedy-2000706230">prepares to hand the reins of the company</a> to Dave Filoni and Lynwen Brennan, Kennedy admits that her one regret in her tenure at Lucasfilm was trying to make what ended up being <a href="https://gizmodo.com/solo-is-proof-that-were-star-wars-spoiled-1844390797"><em>Solo: A Star Wars Story.</em></a></p>
<p>“No, I don’t really have any regrets. Well, maybe a bit of regret about <em>Solo: A Star Wars Story</em>,” Kennedy said. “I brought Larry Kasdan in on [it], and we were so excited about that idea. And then when you’re into something, and you realize fundamentally, conceptually, you cannot replace Han Solo, at least right now.”</p>
<p>“As wonderful as Alden Ehrenreich was, and he really was good, and is a wonderful actor, we put him in an impossible situation,” she continued. “And once you’re in it and once you’re committed, you’ve got to carry on. I think I have a bit of regret about that, but not about the moviemaking and filmmaking. I don’t have regrets about that. I just think that conceptually, we did it too soon.”</p>
<p>Kennedy’s honesty is pretty refreshing here, but there’s also another level to it. She specifically says that her regret around <em>Solo</em> doesn’t have to do with “the moviemaking and filmmaking.” Which is odd until you remember that, originally, <a href="https://gizmodo.com/phil-lord-and-chris-miller-explain-how-leaving-solo-mad-1832057617">Phil Lord and Chris Miller</a> were hired to make that movie and were let go during production. Then, <a href="https://gizmodo.com/most-of-solo-was-shot-by-ron-howard-according-to-a-new-1825934420">Ron Howard came on board to finish it</a>. Kennedy saying she doesn’t regret the filmmaking is a not-so-subtle way of acknowledging one of her most controversial decisions as president of Lucasfilm.</p>
<p>To be fair, though, while <em>Solo</em> <a href="https://gizmodo.com/solo-is-proof-that-were-star-wars-spoiled-1844390797">is honestly a pretty great movie</a> and a slam dunk of an idea on paper, Kennedy does nail this. Some characters are too iconic, too tied to a singular actor, to pivot from. And Han Solo, as well as Indiana Jones, is probably one of those.</p>
