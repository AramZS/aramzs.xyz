<figure></figure><p>Rep. Elise Stefanik has decided to drop out of the Republican primary for New York governor, ten days after Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman announced his candidacy.</p>
<p>Stefanik, a six-term congresswoman from upstate New York, has been a longtime ally of President Donald Trump. But Blakeman’s decision to enter the race threw a roadblock in what appeared to be Stefanik’s clear path to the Republican nomination to challenge Gov. Kathy Hochul.</p>
<h2>Why Stefanik quit NY governor race</h2>
<p>In a statement Dec. 19, Stefanik said she suspended her campaign and will not seek re-election to Congress. She noted her decision came while spending time with her family.</p>

<p>"And while many know me as Congresswoman, my most important title is Mom. I believe that being a parent is life's greatest gift and greatest responsibility. I have thought deeply about this, and I know that as a mother, I will feel profound regret if I don't further focus on my young son's safety, growth, and happiness — particularly at his tender age," Stefanik said.</p>
<p>Stefanik asserted she would have won a GOP primary against Blakeman. But, she added, "it is not an effective use of our time or your generous resources to spend the first half of next year in an unnecessary and protracted Republican primary, especially in a challenging state like New York."</p>
<p>State Conservative Party Chairman Gerard Kassar said in a statement that his party was "disappointed" that Stefanik was dropping out.</p>
<p>"Elise is an asset to our state and nation. I have no doubt we’ll see her shine in future roles,” Kassar added.</p>
<h2>What Trump administration says about Stefanik quitting NY governor race</h2>
<p>Trump, when asked previously, chose not to say which GOP candidate — Stefanik or Blakeman — he would support.</p>
<p>"He's a friend, she's a friend — these are two great people running," <a data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" href="https://x.com/morganfmckay/status/1998871127477944628">Trump told reporters at the White House</a> earlier this month. "In a way, I hate to see them running against each other. I hope they're not going to be too damaging (to) each other."</p>
<p>Addressing Stefanik's decision to quit the race, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said, "Stefanik has been an incredible advocate for the people of her district in Upstate New York, and she will always be a true friend to President Trump.”</p>
<p>Stefanik has spent the past few months attacking Hochul on a host of issues, most recently accusing the governor of using the state’s Medicaid contributions “like a personal slush fund for her own behalf.”</p>
<h2>What Hochul campaign says about Stefanik quitting</h2>
<p>Hochul campaign spokesperson Ryan Radulovacki issued a statement asserting, "Stefanik has finally acknowledged reality: If you run against Governor Kathy Hochul, you are going to lose."</p>
<p>“The fact is, ‘100% MAGA’ Bruce Blakeman traveled all the way to D.C. to celebrate Trump’s expensive tariffs, he ran Long Island’s safety net hospital into the ground by appointing corrupt cronies to run it, and let violent crime in Nassau County spike to its highest level in a decade," Radulovacki said.</p>
<p>"Governor Hochul’s message to him or whichever lackey Trump picks to run against her is simple: Bring it on,” Radulovacki added.</p>
<h2>How Stefanik, Blakeman were polling in NY governor</h2>
<p>In early polling, Stefanik held a giant 31-point lead over Blakeman among Republican voters for a potential GOP primary.</p>
<p>Still, Hochul held wide leads over rivals in both parties in the latest polling for the next governor's race, though with plenty of undecided voters and a long road of campaigning ahead.</p>
<p>Hochul led fellow Democrat Antonio Delgado by a gaping 43 points, and Stefanik and Blakeman by 19 and 25 points, respectively. That came from <a data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" href="https://sri.siena.edu/2025/12/16/hochul-holds-19-point-lead-over-stefanik-leads-blakeman-by-25-points/?_gl=1*ea3p45*_ga*MTYxMjM4NjcxMC4xNzYyNTMwMDY5*_ga_XN3VDZ9ZYZ*czE3NjYwMDE2MjUkbzEyJGcwJHQxNzY2MDAxNjI1JGo2MCRsMCRoMA..">a Siena College poll released Dec. 16</a> that asked New York voters about potential one-on-one matchups for Hochul in 2026 — against Delgado in a primary in June and against Stefanik or Blakeman in November.</p>
<p>New York GOP chairman Ed Cox in a statement Dec. 19 urged fellow Republican leaders to rally behind Blakeman.</p>
<p>"Bruce is a fighter who has proven he knows how to win in difficult political terrain. As county executive he cut taxes, fought radical leftwing social policies and made Nassau County the safest county in America," Cox said. The Republican campaign, he added, "will defeat Kathy Hochul, end Democrats’ affordability crisis and put an end to New York’s nation-leading outmigration."</p>
<h2>What to know about Stefanik, Blakeman in NY governor race</h2>
<p>Blakeman, who won a second term last month as leader of one of the country's largest counties, announced his candidacy <a data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/bruce-blakeman-announces-his-run-new-york-governor-setting-up-gop-primary-clash-elise-stefanik">on the "Fox &amp; Friends" show</a> early on Tuesday, Dec. 9, accompanied by a <a data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECmbH6F5qZI">campaign kickoff video</a>. The 70-year-old Long Island native is touting his four-year record, his closeness to Trump, and his big Nov. 4 win in an area where Democrats outnumber Republicans.</p>
<p>During a recent GOP rally in Rockland County, Stefanik blasted Hochul as an "accidental governor" who took office after Andrew Cuomo's resignation in 2021 and has since presided over a web of problems with crime, affordability, energy and anti-semitism. She labeled each a "crisis" for the state.</p>
