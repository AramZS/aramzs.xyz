<h3>World’s biggest YouTuber touts JustServe</h3>
<p>What connection does the church have with the global YouTube phenomenon known as MrBeast?</p>
<p>Well, they’re partners — or, at least, have been — in philanthropy.</p>
<p>A popular YouTuber and content creator, Jimmy Donaldson, aka <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX6OQ3DkcsbYNE6H8uQQuVA">MrBeast</a>, has amassed 460 million subscribers and is well known for giving away exorbitant amounts of cash.</p>
<p>In January 2024, MrBeast announced that his nonprofit, <a href="https://www.beastphilanthropy.org/">Beast Philanthropy</a>, was partnering with <a href="https://www.justserve.org/content/mlk-day-of-service?lang=eng&amp;cid=mlk_google_search_ad_2026&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=23422058284&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiA1JLLBhCDARIsAAVfy7i5BG8pv_91IVFdeGID02V7RXjechhOm78rgVeGIWfourhZzi1BoroaAra9EALw_wcB">JustServe</a>, the voluntarism platform sponsored by the church.</p>
<p>MrBeast founded his charity in 2020 on a separate YouTube channel, where he announced that 100% of the profits from this effort would go toward charitable causes. This additional channel has already garnered nearly 29 million subscribers.</p>
<p>In a post about JustServe, Beast Philanthropy said that many followers ask how they can support the causes MrBeast shows in his videos. The post directed subscribers to the faith’s JustServe app, which connects users with a wide range of volunteer options.</p>
<p>“We’ve recently partnered with @JustServe, an app that helps match volunteers with the right organization,” the <a href="https://x.com/BeastPhilanthr/status/1751972175412686923">post</a> states. “...We believe that volunteering and helping other people is one of the greatest things that you can do, not only for others but for yourself.”</p>
<p>On Beast Philanthropy’s <a href="https://www.beastphilanthropy.org/supporters">website</a>, the church is listed as a Diamond sponsor.</p>
<p>The church “seeks out and renders aid to all without regard to religious affiliation, race or nationality,” the site says. “The church, its members, and its friends have combined their donations with volunteer efforts to relieve suffering and build self-reliance around the world.”</p>
<p>The church confirmed the partnership but added that since the initial collaboration, the relationship has been dormant.</p>
<h3>New stakes — from Arizona to Zimbabwe</h3>
<p>The stakes keep getting higher.</p>
<p>In the past three months, independent researcher Matt Martinich reports at <a href="https://ldschurchgrowth.blogspot.com/2025/12/28-new-stakes-and-11-new-districts.html">ldschurchgrowth.blogspot.com</a>, the church has created 28 stakes (regional clusters of congregations), pushing the 2025 total past 90, the loftiest annual tally since 2016.</p>
<p>Martinich notes the recent highlights:</p>
<p>• Five new stakes in Utah County (upping the Beehive State’s total to 647 overall, according to the <a href="https://churchofjesuschristtemples.org/statistics/locations/united-states/stakes/">churchofjesuschristtemples.org</a> website).</p>
<p>• Four new stakes in the Democratic Republic of Congo (45 overall) and another four in the Philippines (141).</p>
