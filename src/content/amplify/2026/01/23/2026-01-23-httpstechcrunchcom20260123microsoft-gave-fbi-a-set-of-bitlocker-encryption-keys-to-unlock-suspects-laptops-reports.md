<p>Microsoft provided the FBI with the recovery keys to unlock encrypted data on the hard drives of three laptops as part of a federal investigation, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2026/01/22/microsoft-gave-fbi-keys-to-unlock-bitlocker-encrypted-data/">Forbes reported on Friday</a>.</p>
<p>Many modern Windows computers rely on full-disk encryption, called BitLocker, which is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/14/24220138/microsoft-bitlocker-device-encryption-windows-11-default">enabled by default</a>. This type of technology should prevent anyone except the device owner from accessing the data if the computer is locked and powered off.</p>
<p>But, by default, BitLocker recovery keys are uploaded to Microsoft’s cloud, allowing the tech giant — and by extension law enforcement — to access them and use them to decrypt drives encrypted with BitLocker, as with the case reported by Forbes.</p>
<p>The case involved several people suspected of fraud related to the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program in Guam, a U.S. island in the Pacific. Local news outlet Pacific Daily News <a href="https://www.guampdn.com/news/another-unsealed-warrant-encrypted-data-seized-in-pua-fraud-investigation/article_1b98b770-daf5-436a-97f9-3a11f57accf5.html">covered</a> the case last year, reporting that a warrant had been served to Microsoft in relation to the suspects’ hard drives. Kandit News, another local Guam news outlet, <a href="https://kanditnews.com/3rd-warrant-against-tenorio-unsealed-encrypted-computer-files-seized/">also reported</a> in October that the FBI requested the warrant six months after seizing the three laptops encrypted with BitLocker.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for Microsoft did not immediately respond to a request for comment by TechCrunch. Microsoft told Forbes that the company sometimes provides BitLocker recovery keys to authorities, having received an average of 20 such requests per year.</p>
<p>Apart from the privacy risks of handing recovery keys to a company, Johns Hopkins professor and cryptography expert Matthew Green <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matthewdgreen.bsky.social/post/3md3vciumvk2s">raised the potential scenario</a> where malicious hackers compromise Microsoft’s cloud infrastructure — something that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/17/microsoft-lost-keys-government-hacked/">has happened</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/19/hackers-breached-microsoft-to-find-out-what-microsoft-knows-about-them/">several times</a> in recent years — and get access to these recovery keys. The hackers would still need physical access to the hard drives to use the stolen recovery keys.</p>
<p>“It’s 2026 and these concerns have been known for years,” Green wrote in a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matthewdgreen.bsky.social/post/3md3vnprijk2s">post on Bluesky</a>. “Microsoft’s inability to secure critical customer keys is starting to make it an outlier from the rest of the industry.”</p>
