<p>There is a dashboard for <a href="https://www.pizzint.watch">pizza places around the Pentagon</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Pentagon Pizza Index (PizzINT) is a real-time dashboard that monitors pizza shop popularity around the Pentagon area in Arlington, Virginia. Based on the famous “Pentagon Pizza Theory,” this project tracks potential correlations between late-night pizza orders and military activity.</p> <p>Originally a Cold War-era observation that pizza deliveries to government buildings might indicate crisis activity, the theory gained internet fame during recent geopolitical events. Our dashboard brings this concept into the digital age using publicly available data.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m torn because this is centered around crypto and memecoins, but a good dashboard built for the right audience and purpose is a good dashboard.</p>
