<p>This month, we — the creators of</p>
<p>@leaflet.pub</p>
<p>,</p>
<p>@pckt.blog</p>
<p>, and</p>
<p>@offprint.app</p>
<p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/standard.site/post/3mbfoiwutps2r">announced</a></p>
<p>@standard.site</p>
<p>, a set of shared standards for longform publishing on the open social web:</p>
<figure><a data-index="1" href="https://standard.site/"><img src="https://lab.leaflet.pub/api/atproto_images?did=did:plc:btxrwcaeyodrap5mnjw2fvmz&amp;cid=bafkreidccmedpxkpe7eb7bngn7uyzoxq4mlzx2fowygvgb7lcncy7ohb6u"/></a></figure>
<p>At its core <a href="https://standard.site">standard.site</a> is a set of AT Protocol lexicons for:</p>
<p>TL;DR — <a href="https://standard.site">standard.site</a> makes it easier for platforms and publications to coordinate and build cool things together!</p>
<p>The initial focus is facilitating interoperability around content discovery and social features like subscribing and commenting.</p>
<p>Importantly, this is not a standard for site content.</p>
<p>We each want to explore different things with our platforms, from block-based editors to unique theming. We also want to make it easy for existing sites to adopt without fully syndicating content.</p>
<p>Publishing apps can implement to make content discoverable across platforms, so we can build a richer ecosystem together.</p>
<p>Individual sites can publish records — WordPress, self-hosted, wherever, from indie blogs to big publishers — to give their content a presence on the open social web.</p>
<p>See below for examples of what folks are doing with this already!</p>
<p>We've just finished our migration to <a href="https://standard.site">standard.site</a> lexicons! This was a big project, to our knowledge one of the largest schema migrations in the atmosphere so far.</p>
<p>How it works, TL;DR:</p>
<ul><li><p data-index="17.2">We've run this migration proactively for folks with active sessions; otherwise it'll run the next time you log in</p> </li></ul>
<p>No need for you to do anything special — just log into Leaflet! We'll handle the relevant migrations automatically.</p>
<p>What to know — Leaflet tinkerers:</p>
<p>If you've built apps or custom integration apps that use Leaflet records, ping us if you need help migrating to use <a href="https://standard.site">standard.site</a> records. We'll figure it out together!</p>
<h3 data-index="23">An ecosystem emerges…</h3>
<p>2026 is the year of atproto publishing — <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jimray.bsky.team/post/3mbhchxbfns2n">many are saying</a> this!</p>
<p>In just the first few weeks, we've seen a strong positive reception for <a href="https://standard.site">standard.site</a> and adoption by both platforms and individuals:</p>
<h3 data-index="32">Open social publishing — blogosphere to atmosphere!</h3>
<p>With <a href="https://standard.site">standard.site</a> we can make atproto publishing platforms more interoperable — and we can make it easier to bridge between atproto and the rest of the internet, both platforms and individual sites.</p>
<p>For example, Leaflet and Pckt can both render previews of posts created on the other platform — and by Offprint, or anyone else — in our respective Reader pages. Others can make entirely separate readers, or search engines, or bookmarking tools (to name a few examples already emerging!) and all experiment with different features and ways to add value for readers and writers.</p>
<p>We're particularly excited about how <a href="https://standard.site">standard.site</a> offers publishers a flexible way to bring existing publications onto atproto.</p>
<p>We see this as complementing, not replacing, existing standards for the open web. You can still use RSS! This gives publications a standard social layer, wherever they may live.</p>
<p>If you have a self-hosted static site or WordPress blog, you can publish these records to make your site discoverable on atproto, without having to migrate your content.</p>
<p>We also want to make it easier for existing sites to both implement <a href="https://standard.site">standard.site</a> and layer on social pieces like comments and subscriptions. If that sounds interesting, reach out, let's chat!</p>
<h3 data-index="40">Open questions and things to explore further</h3>
<p>We intentionally started with a pretty minimal set of lexicons, and we're already seeing a lot of good questions and suggestions for extending and improving <a href="https://standard.site">standard.site</a>, like:</p>
<p>Please let us know any thoughts on how we can make Leaflet + <a href="https://standard.site">standard.site</a> work better, and tag</p>
<p>@standard.site</p>
<p>on Bluesky for questions / ideas.</p>
<p>There's also an <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/standard.site/post/3mcfnzybbck23">open Signal group</a> for folks interested in more detailed discussion on lexicons, implementation, and so on.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>@brookie.blog</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>@aka.dad</p>
<p>for joining together to get this off the ground. Excited to see what everyone continues to build!</p>
