Blaire White had her hands wrapped around a pink Glock 17 that she had turned into a rifle with the help of a conversion kit. It’s one of more than a dozen guns Blaire owns, plus a pink flamethrower branded with her initials, “BW.” She was spraying bullets at a multicolored paper skeleton named “Vital Dude.” Blaire shot the Dude 11 times. Then she placed the gun on a counter next to a pink AR-15.</p><p>“A lot of people talk about how it’s a good stress reliever, and it is,” the 32-year-old YouTuber told me on the way to the range.</p><p>She drove a Mustang — which used to be pink, too, until she took the vinyl wrapping off in the hope of selling it ahead of an impending move to California.<b> </b>She’s nervous about the gun laws there. Her Glock 17 is legal, and the conversion kit is legal, but you can’t put the two together. So she will have to transform the pink rifle back into a handgun. “If anything,” Blaire says, “I’m losing rights by going back to California.”</p><p>There are many ways to understand Blaire White. Here’s one: She is a trans woman in Donald Trump’s America who, when she talks about losing her rights, appears primarily concerned with losing her guns.</p><p>“Don’t say the t-word too loud,” Blaire told Joey Sarson, her fiancé and producer, as I was interviewing him over the cacophony of gunfire.</p><p class="rw-outer-content"><span>Some content could not be imported from the original document.</span> <a href="https://washingtonpost.com/style/power/2026/01/23/blaire-white-maga-trans-influencer/">View content ↗ </a></p><p>She isn’t the only visible pro-Trump trans person on the right — Caitlyn Jenner, the Olympian and mega-celebrity, was on record supporting the president <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/25/us/politics/caitlyn-jenner-trump-transgender-policy.html" target="_blank">in 2016</a> and <a href="https://x.com/Caitlyn_Jenner/status/1853086512126284127?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1853086512126284127%7Ctwgr%5E9604426e5be1830680da76a8b7fbf0119f868b54%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailymail.co.uk%2Fsport%2Fothersports%2Farticle-14036031%2FCaitlyn-Jenner-reveals-voted-2024-election-Donald-Trump-Kamala-Harris.html" target="_blank">2024</a>. But with 1.5 million YouTube subscribers on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@BlaireWhiteX" target="_blank">her personal page</a> and another 688,000 on the page for her <a href="https://www.youtube.com/theblairewhiteproject" target="_blank">podcast</a>, “The Blaire White Project” — plus 540,000 followers on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/msblairewhite/?hl=en" target="_blank">Instagram</a> and more than 700,000 on <a href="https://x.com/BlaireWhite" target="_blank">X</a> — she may be the most visible right-wing trans<b> </b>personality who has built a following exclusively online.</p><p>Apart from her support of adults who want to transition, Blaire’s views on trans rights are deeply conservative: She believes there are only two genders. She is against trans women competing in women’s sports (she thinks they should have their own, separate league). She believes governments should ban medical transition care for trans children, regardless of parental consent. She rejects the label “transgender” and identifies instead as “transsexual,” a term that some in the community consider outdated because it tethers transition to biological sex. And although her Texas driver’s license identifies her as female, she argues that trans women like herself are not “women.”</p><p>Blaire’s blend of identities has made her a curiosity among certain influential media dudes. She sees herself as an ambassador to their audiences, a figure well-positioned to nudge manosphere bros and the American right to accept trans people at a fundamental level. “You’re the perfect spokesperson,” Alex Jones told Blaire on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=303172548893147" target="_blank">“Infowars” in 2023</a>. Piers Morgan, Tim Pool and Michael Knowles have also had her on their shows. When Blaire appeared on <a href="https://youtu.be/AGv9HIEZUyY?si=6aOh4s3L2M50eYcM&amp;t=7991" target="_blank">Joe Rogan’s immensely popular podcast</a> in 2021, the two seemed to agree that conservatives were unduly obsessed with trans people.</p><p>“It’s the dumbest value to concentrate on,” Rogan said.</p><p>“It is,” Blaire said, “but it’s like, the main value for so many of them.”</p><p class="rw-outer-content"><span>Some content could not be imported from the original document.</span> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C6j_hjZJyC7/">View content ↗ </a></p><p>At the same time, Blaire’s conservative views on how trans people should behave in society, and how exactly society should make room for them, have put her on the wrong side of the LGBTQ+ rights movement. It doesn’t help that her polemics against the queer left are far from diplomatic, to say the least. She has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/i9fiBIQnhsA" target="_blank">ridiculed</a> people who use gender-neutral pronouns and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/qii_Tnk-_Bo" target="_blank">spoken dismissively</a> of nonbinary people. She has said the trans community has an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaaZtYBB9BI&amp;t=3s" target="_blank">“actual IQ problem.”</a> After Trump’s second inauguration, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzicDKSUCss&amp;t=83s" target="_blank">she predicted the end of the “trans lunacy”</a> that had “taken over” society.</p><p>“I don’t think that any of us in the community can sit back and say, ‘Oh, Blaire, we welcome you in with open arms,’ as you are actually sitting there and saying, ‘Oh, y’all are stupid. Y’all are delusional. You all need therapy. Y’all are crazy,’” said Hope Giselle-Godsey, an activist and content creator who served as executive director of the 2024 National Trans Visibility March.</p><p>Pool, a friend of Blaire’s, doesn’t see the modern conservative movement fully opening its arms to her, either, even if some intrigued podcasters are willing to hear her out. “I don’t see it as being physically possible for Blaire to pull off this acceptance on the right,” he said.</p><p>So, her project is complicated. “I’m too trans for the right, and too right for the trans community,” Blaire told me in one of our conversations. “If I wanted to have some perfect right-wing narrative to really sell myself to people in there, I would be apologizing for being trans, or detransitioning — which is so psychotic, to do that.”</p><p>What’s a (trans) woman to do?</p><p>Maybe run for office: Blaire wants to do that after the midterms — as a Republican, in Southern California.</p><p>Keep making a living:<b> </b>“I’m making more money this year, I would say, than any other year,” she told me.</p><p>And keep talking to the bros.</p><p>“Someone has to bridge the gap,” she said. “Someone has to be the trans woman sitting across from Joe Rogan breaking bread, because if it’s not me, then that means that that bridge is never, ever connected.”</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/wapo/4TXQOADDBHNUCTEZUC7XODWZIU.JPG"/><figcaption>“I’m too trans for the right, and too right for the trans community,” Blaire White says. (Jane Greer/For The Washington Post)</figcaption></figure><p>In November, Blaire brought me along for an appointment at Aesthetica Medspa, a beauty clinic in a Texas business park, where she has been coming about once a month.<b> </b>She arrived in brown sweats and a skintight black turtleneck, with a gold Louis Vuitton cuff on one wrist and French tips on her acrylic nails.</p><p>The “clean girl”/West Hollywood provocatrice<b> </b>aesthetic is carefully curated. Blaire said she finds the dopamine rush she gets from cosmetic treatments a bit<b> </b>addicting, but her injectables habit can also feel like a job requirement. The camera flattens your face, she would later explain. “There’s no angles to fluff it out. It’s just you. Right there.” Today’s appointment would run her $763.</p><p>“There’s only one cuck chair,” Joey, 38, joked as we walked into the treatment room, before claiming a seat.</p><p>Blaire’s fiancé is tall, bearded and friendly; he smiles reflexively when you make eye contact. Joey’s duties include replying to emails and handling brand partnerships. (On her channel, Blaire has advertised a weight-loss hypnosis app, cocoa flavonol powders and a sleeping supplement, among other products.) It’s a bit difficult to tell where his fiancé role ends and his work role begins. “I just do everything she needs,” Joey told me at one point. “She has a lot of needs, too.”</p><p>Before devoting himself to the Blaire White project, he had been a prank show producer back in Los Angeles. He had dated a trans woman there and found the trans community to be really cool — they had fun events, underground parties. But then the events started becoming more political when Trump, whom Joey supported, ran for president. He was ready to swear off dating trans people, and then he came across Blaire’s videos. “I was like, no way she’s trans,” he told me.<b> </b>He became infatuated. (Joey’s sexuality is the subject of fascination online: “I can’t be entirely straight. … I’m attracted to <i>Blaire</i>, you know? And I really just like — I’m Blairesexual, I guess.”) He tried getting her attention with comments on her live streams, on Facebook, on WhatsApp. She eventually responded, and they got dinner at a Dave &amp; Buster’s in Hollywood in 2017. They have been engaged for more than seven years.</p><p>“Okay, pull down like you’re mad?” Erika Ponce instructed Blaire, who was now sitting in a reclining chair.</p><p>Blaire did as her aesthetician told her. The muscles around her forehead barely scrunched down.</p><p>“Okay, pull up like you’re surprised?”</p><p>The muscles barely budged. Ponce asked Blaire to repeat the process.</p><p>“I mean—” Ponce sighed. “You just, you don’t have any movement there.” She could give her more Botox, but it would only make the current effect last longer.</p><p>So it was on to the filler. The syringeful went in her lips, the ridges above them, elsewhere. This was all calculated: Blaire explained that she sees some of the procedures related to her transition almost as a math equation — shorter or longer<b> </b>distances between certain features and sharper angles between others equal being read as a woman. In 2017,<b> </b>she vlogged her experience undergoing surgeries that yielded a lower hairline, higher eyebrows, a flatter brow ridge and a smoother nose profile. “I didn’t go in being, like, ‘Make me look beautiful,’” she told me. “I went in, like, ‘Make this a female proportion.’”</p><p class="rw-outer-content"><span>Some content could not be imported from the original document.</span> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyHB0COkw3s">View content ↗ </a></p><p>One of Blaire’s earliest memories, she told Rogan during her appearance on his show, was<b> </b>noticing that backpack cubbies at her preschool were separated by gender — some pink, others blue — and sensing that she would never be able to fit into “maleness.” As she got older, she remembers being bullied for being feminine,<b> </b>not fitting into the boxes that society had prescribed for how boys should behave. Home didn’t feel like a safe haven, either; her parents fought frequently. “Our home could be very volatile,” recalled Blaire’s mother, Eleanor Orduno. At one point, Orduno said, her husband threw away Blaire’s makeup.</p><p>The world saw her daughter<b> </b>and judged, but Orduno tried to understand. She recalled Blaire going to her arms when she was about 7 years old, talking about not wanting to be alive. “She’d ask me questions that I didn’t know the answers to,” Orduno said. She would stay up at night doing research.<b> </b>“I mean, I had notebooks just stacked up with notes that I wrote about everything.”</p><p>When she was 20, Blaire called home from Michigan — where she had been living with a boyfriend, and where few others knew her — and explained that people there had been addressing her as a woman, and that she had decided to start transitioning. Orduno was supportive, but it was difficult for her to adapt to Blaire’s new name and pronouns. She said her accidental lapses angered Blaire, who would either scream or fall silent for some time. “I just kept slipping and slipping,” Orduno told me, “and, you know, and it was really, really, really painful to her.”</p><p>Blaire’s mother<b> </b>sought guidance from a trans support group. The young trans people there<b> </b>were all in deep pain, Orduno recalled, but they were willing to answer her questions for three hours. She listened. “And I cried, and they cried,” Orduno said. “And it was — it was just so moving.” She later talked Blaire into going to the support group with her. Her daughter came away from the trans support group with another insight: She was a poor fit in the community.</p><p>“There was no one there that identified just like, someone born male who’s transitioning to a woman,” Blaire recalled. “It was all genderqueer. It was nonbinary. It was terms like ‘transmasculine’ or ‘transfeminine.’ And I’m like, ‘What is this?’”</p><figure><video controls=""><source src="https://d3celq77losjk8.cloudfront.net/wapo/2026/01/16/696a61563862e27c4061af46/file_1920x1080_5400_v4.mp4" type="video/mp4"/></video></figure><p>In late 2015, Blaire decided to change her name and begin hormone replacement therapy. She was taking computer science classes in college at the time, but within a month she started dabbling in the kind of political commentary that, in short order, would make it possible for her to drop out of school.</p><p>That December, she uploaded her first video, titled “Female Privilege | Antifeminism.” Speaking to the camera, she said feminists were overstating the idea of “male privilege” and described how strangers changed the way they treated her based on her feminine appearance. “It manifested in ways such as doors being held open for me, seats on public transportation being surrendered — instantly, really,” she said <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3pYjYxl86E" target="_blank">in the video</a>.</p><p>Blaire made more videos.</p><p><i>Male Struggles.</i></p><p><i>Gender Is NOT A Social Construct!</i></p><p><i>Special Snowflake Syndrome.</i></p><p>She told me that at one point she discovered that<b> </b>her college roommates were getting together to watch her videos and bad-mouth her behind her back. “I remember being like, ‘Oh, this is a sign I need to keep going,’” she said. “Because this is like some hater s---. This is like, I’m onto something.’”</p><p>The monetization of her videos earned her the $16,000 she spent on facial feminization surgery and breast augmentation. In 2017, from a Dallas hotel room the night before those surgeries, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cm_63_XFik" target="_blank">she filmed one of her most-watched</a> — and most vulnerable — early videos. “I hate being out of control of my own body, and also —” Her throat caught, and her eyes started welling up. “I just can’t shake this feeling of like, wanting my dad.” After the surgeries, she filmed herself lying down on her bed — face swollen, staples along her hairline. “It’s really upsetting,” she told her followers, “because I thought I was on the fast track towards healing, because the swelling was not this bad even this morning, and this is just absolutely terrible.” Just outside the frame, her mom was cleaning her wounds.</p><p>On the first night after surgery, Orduno remembers Blaire saying that going through the process had already eased the discomfort she had been feeling with her gender. Orduno<b> </b>isn’t sure if she would have tried to get gender transition care for Blaire when she was a minor, had she known about it. But she doesn’t presume to know what is right for other families. “Obviously, it’s up to the parents,” she said. As for the care Blaire ended up getting as an adult: “It saved my child.”</p><p>Online, Blaire’s identities as a trans woman and a conservative internet figure would not just coexist, but intertwine.</p><p>She would inject a kind of mean-girl energy into her videos, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WpqSJe89Lc" target="_blank">mocking people</a> whose gender presentations or identities she didn’t see as fitting into male or female archetypes — she says she often plays up the attitude for comedic effect —<b> </b>and using words like “predator” in her takedowns of other figures online. When trans people began raising alarms about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/21/us/politics/transgender-trump-administration-sex-definition.html" target="_blank">Trump’s plans to roll back their antidiscrimination protections</a> during his first term, she would <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXRRIG8o3wg" target="_blank">respond</a> that their concerns were overblown. And she would point to her feelings of alienation at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUoI30m3p2M" target="_blank">trans support group</a> as evidence that the queer community was bent on indoctrinating young, vulnerable trans people seeking support like her. Her journey, as she saw it, was one of self-reliance and<b> </b>individualism.</p><p>“So many people ask me, like, ‘How can you be right-wing and trans?’” she said in a <a href="https://youtu.be/wY0v1lDz9h0?si=TiFFSlgatQ_Ud2_K&amp;t=899" target="_blank">2022 interview</a>. “And it’s like, honestly? I think that being trans actually made me right-wing.”</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/wapo/GTOE6EVFLCQX4WOR64L6ECYPM4.JPG"/><figcaption>“I think that being trans actually made me right-wing,” Blaire White says. (Jane Greer/For The Washington Post)</figcaption></figure><p>At a restaurant in downtown Austin one night in November, while eating salty fries her aesthetician advised against (salt bloats), Blaire outlined her theory of the American backlash against trans people: The community <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzicDKSUCss" target="_blank">brought this on itself</a>.</p><p>“There’s this myth that hate against a group is never the group’s fault,” she said. “The unfortunate reality is you can bring stuff on yourself. You can do things that make people hate you, and just because they hate you doesn’t mean that it’s necessarily unjustified.” When pressed on <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/10/22/trump-republican-transgender-strategy-advertisements/" target="_blank">the role of Trump and his allies</a>, she allowed that “the vitriol goes too far on the right, when they start really seeing everybody as just an example of a political argument they’re winning in their head.” But the way Blaire sees it, the trans community and its allies asked for too much, too aggressively.</p><p>“The issues came when there was this angry, forceful, ‘You must use my pronouns. You must agree with me. You can never say this. That’s offensive,’” she said. “People have resentments towards that.”</p><p>Blaire White’s prescription for how to be a <i>non</i>-hated trans person is, basically, to be a bit more like Blaire White.</p><p>She uses women’s bathrooms but not “anywhere where you get naked” or “anywhere where there could be a problem.”</p><p>She doesn’t believe she should have had access to transition care as a minor and says trans rights activists are doomed to fail so long as they advocate for it. (<a href="https://publications.aap.org/aapnews/news/33988/AAP-Proposed-restrictions-to-gender-affirming-care?autologincheck=redirected" target="_blank">Leading</a> <a href="https://www.ama-assn.org/about/leadership/everyone-deserves-quality-medical-care-delivered-without-bias" target="_blank">medical</a> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2024/12/03/gender-trans-hormones-kids-health/" target="_blank">associations</a> have <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2024/12/03/gender-trans-hormones-kids-health/" target="_blank">largely backed such care</a>. They have also acknowledged the long-term unknowns that skeptics have raised about the treatments, while <a href="https://wpath.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/WPATH-USPATH-Response-to-HHS-Report-02May2025-3.pdf" target="_blank">pointing out</a> the potentially harmful mental health effects of a child going through puberty in a way that is not aligned with their gender identity.)</p><p>She doesn’t clap back too hard when the podcast bros question her pronouns. “You’re not trying to leap through the camera and strangle me,” Ben Shapiro told her during a 2018 “debate” about pronouns that was more of a friendly chat.</p><p>Giselle-Godsey, the activist,<b> </b>does not think that<b> </b>queer people will gain anything by asking for less accommodation.<b> </b>“If nonbinary people and trans people said, ‘You know what? Fine, f--- it. Call me whatever you wanted to call me,’” she said, then “they would move the goalposts and find something else.” In her eyes, Blaire is advertising an elitist version of womanhood — specifically, the kind she believes conservatives idealize — and that her appearance is doing a lot of work. (“Your bones,” Alex Jones told her, “look like a woman.”)</p><p class="rw-outer-content"><span>Some content could not be imported from the original document.</span> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6IonRH1-ow">View content ↗ </a></p><p>Ari Drennen, the former LGBTQ program director at the watchdog Media Matters for America, said<b> </b>that Blaire’s mere presence in the manosphere might help neutralize some of the caricatures about trans people — even if she is not saying what some advocates wish she would say. “The fact is,” Drennen says, “that for a lot of right-wing audiences, that’s going to be their first exposure to the idea that there are people who transition successfully and live their lives as trans people presenting themselves as the opposite sex.”</p><p>Giselle-Godsey thinks just sitting on studio couches across from the bros isn’t enough.<b> </b>Someone <i>should</i> be speaking to conservative audiences, she says. “But if you’re going to do this, if you’re going to be <i>that </i>trans woman, why not use that platform to go against the BS?”</p><p>Blaire believes she <i>is</i> going against the “BS.” In 2017, she was a guest on a podcast hosted by Michael Knowles, a prominent conservative commentator. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itepqoaLpc" target="_blank">episode</a>’s eventual title: “Should I Call You He Or She?”</p><p>“My reason tells me it would be objecting to reality to say ‘she,’” Knowles said, “and yet you’re my guest, you’re my friend. My politeness would object to calling you ‘he.’”</p><p>Blaire presented Knowles with a real-world scenario: If they were going out to dinner and he was late and trying to find her upon arriving at the restaurant, “you wouldn’t say ‘He’s in the black top over there,’” she said. Knowles laughed and seemed to agree: “Yeah, that’s right. He’s in the silky dress over there.”</p><p>“So it’s just about what makes sense,” Blaire said.</p><p><i>Did </i>it make sense to him? Knowles didn’t respond to several requests for comment. But six years after that conversation, in a speech, he declared that “transgenderism must be eradicated from public life entirely.”</p><p>Blaire insisted to me that Knowles’s rhetoric was just online bluster — that he never misgendered her in person.</p><p>Late last year, Knowles brought her up again on his show.</p><p>“You remember Blaire White?” Knowles said. “Blaire is a guy, but he sort of identifies as a girl, even though he admits he’s not really a woman.”</p><p class="rw-outer-content"><span>Some content could not be imported from the original document.</span> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQXQfs7wCdY">View content ↗ </a></p><p>Blaire has attracted enough measurable attention to earn her a living. She wouldn’t say exactly how much money she makes, only that YouTube has been lucrative enough that she has never felt like she needs another job.</p><p>The amount of political influence she has on the right is harder to quantify — and not entirely up to her.</p><p>“There’s two conservative factions” right now, Pool told me. “There’s one that says ‘No enemies to the right,’ and the other that says, you know, ‘We decide who our enemies are.’” The question for ideologues on the right, he says, is this: “Who are you willing to side with?”</p><p>Buck Angel said the right might not be willing to side with Blaire fully, but it matters that she keeps showing up on their talk shows. “It’s like the KKK inviting some Black person to sit in the middle of their ceremony, right?” said Angel, a trans YouTuber and a fan of Blaire. “It takes balls to go sit in the middle of that space, even though they’re acting like your friend. They probably, at the end of the day, wouldn’t want you to exist.”</p><p>Discovering Blaire’s content convinced Angel, a 63-year-old former adult film actor, that the mainstream politics of the LGBTQ+ community weren’t for him, either. He has followed her lead, making videos online speaking out against it. Now, he says,<b> </b>“I wouldn’t say that I belong to any community. And if you were going to ask me, straight up, ‘What community does Blaire belong to?’ I think she’s the same way. I think she also doesn’t feel that community.”</p><p>In Austin, Blaire lived a bit of a hermit life. She and Joey said they<b> </b>mostly get out to go to the spa or the gym or to dine out. Their home smelled intensely sweet. Outside of one of the upstairs rooms where she made her content, a 2006 school writing competition certificate issued to her old name hung on the wall. Blaire has never felt like she stopped being that person.</p><p>But making her self into her livelihood has changed her. “When you make content and you do what I do, there is this aspect of making yourself a brand, right? So you kind of dehumanize yourself,” she told me. “Maybe that sounds harsh, but you turn yourself into a product, because you want clicks and you want money and all those things. That’s a part of it.”</p><p>The next part of the Blaire White project involves getting elected to office. Blaire thinks her creator career is a natural on-ramp. “Trump was a celebrity,” she notes, and “influencers are the celebrities of the time.” She sees members of Congress such as Reps. Jasmine Crockett and Nancy Mace, looks at their social media content, “and I’m like, no way. If these idiots could be in Congress, then I would objectively be better. Sorry!”</p><p>By late December, she had sold about half of the guns and the flamethrower, and she was looking for a buyer for the formerly pink Mustang. She hasn’t found a new medspa in California or a gun range. The new house in the San Diego area<b> </b>is isolated, she said, with no neighbors around — “super comforting.”</p><p>She does live closer to her mom now. When I asked Orduno — who is a Democrat — if she would vote for Blaire if she ran for office, she laughed. “Um.” She laughed again. “I’m not going to answer that. I don’t know.” (Orduno doesn’t watch all of Blaire’s content, and the two don’t talk politics.)</p><p>Orduno hasn’t always had the answers. But she continues to support Blaire’s transition. Before she understood what her daughter was going through, she <i>wanted </i>to understand.<b> </b>When Blaire was a teenager, Orduno recalled, there was a period when she would rarely come out of the house, but the two would go on late-night walks near the Sacramento River. During one of those walks, she remembers Blaire saying, “Mom, I’m going to be famous. I don’t know how, I don’t know when, but one day I’m going to be famous.” To which she replied: “I think, someday, you’re going to have a voice that people will listen to.”</p><p>“It was really me and her against the world,” Orduno told me, looking back. “Even when I didn’t know what was going on, I was still trying to help her.”</p></body></html>
