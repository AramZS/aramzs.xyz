<p>After an ICE agent shot and killed Renee Good in Minneapolis this week, firing his weapon as she attempted to drive away, protesters have amassed around the country, many wondering: Can that officer be taken to court?</p>
<p>The Trump administration, predictably, says the agent, Jonathan Ross, is immune from prosecution. “You have a federal law enforcement official engaging in federal law enforcement action,” Vice President JD Vance told reporters on Thursday. “That guy is protected by absolute immunity. He was doing his job.”</p>
<p>But what do independent attorneys say? After the shooting, I reached out to Robert Bennett, a veteran lawyer in Minneapolis who has worked on hundreds of federal police misconduct cases during his 50-year career. “I’ve deposed thousands of police officers,” he says. “ICE agents do not have absolute immunity.”</p>
<p>Bennett says the state of Minnesota has the right to prosecute an ICE agent who commits misconduct. But, he adds, that might be difficult now that the FBI has <a href="https://dps.mn.gov/news/bca/bca-statement-regarding-investigation-ice-fatal-shooting-minneapolis">essentially booted</a> the state’s Bureau of Criminal Apprehension off the case—blocking access, the BCA wrote, to “case materials, scene evidence or investigative interviews necessary to complete a thorough and independent investigation.”</p>
<p>In the conversation below, edited for length and clarity, Bennett discusses how the shooting in Minneapolis unfolded and the legal paths forward.</p>
<p><strong>When you watched the videos of this shooting, what did you see? </strong></p>
<p>You saw what could be easily identified as four ICE officers. And they’re all experiencing, to a greater or lesser extent, the same set of operative facts, the same factual stimuli. But only one officer, seeing the set of circumstances, picked up his weapon. None of the other officers did. That’s a bad fact [for Ross].</p>
<p>Also, the officer walked in front of the car, which counts against him in the reasonableness analysis. If you look at the recent Supreme Court case of <em>Barnes v. Felix</em>, that’s problematic for the ICE agent.</p>
<p><strong>What happened in <em>Barnes v. Felix</em>? </strong></p>
<p>It’s a shooting case where the officer walked around the car, [lunged<br/>
and jumped onto the door sill], and <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2024/23-1239">put himself in harm’s way</a>. You can’t bootstrap your own bad situation [to] allow a use of force.</p>
<p><strong>What did the court find?</strong></p>
<p>They sent it back to the trial court to consider it. But there’s good language in there.</p>
<p><strong>You said it’s bad news for the ICE agent, Ross, that his colleagues didn’t pull their weapons. Can you talk more about that?</strong></p>
<p>Sure, we’ve had several other cases. There was a tactical semicircle, a bunch of officers aiming their guns at a couple fighting over a knife; one officer out of the eight or nine fired his weapon, none of the others perceived the need to.</p>
<p><strong>And that’s important because it suggests the officer who fired wasn’t reasonable, right? Under federal law, an officer can only use deadly force if they had a reasonable fear that they could otherwise be killed or harmed. </strong></p>
<p>It’s an <em>objective</em> reasonableness standard. So it’s not whether you were personally scared out of your wits and fired your gun. It’s: Would an objectively reasonable officer at the scene have fired his weapon, believing he was in danger of death or immediate bodily harm?</p>
<p>In Ross’ case, there was a previous incident—Ross had shot [with a Taser] through a window before at somebody in the car, and the guy hit the gas, and Ross had stuck his arm through the broken window, and he got cut [and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/08/us/ice-agent-jonathan-ross-minneapolis-shooting.html">dragged about 100 yards</a>]. And so he was supposedly reacting to that. He’s not an objective officer at that point.</p>
<p><strong>The Trump administration has suggested that Ross is immune from prosecution as a federal officer. Why do you say he’s not? </strong></p>
<p>There’s plenty of case law that allows for the prosecution of federal law enforcement agencies, including ICE. And it’s clear under the law that a federal officer who shoots somebody in Minnesota and kills them is subject to a Minnesota investigation and Minnesota law.</p>
<p>Now, the <a href="https://dps.mn.gov/news/bca/bca-statement-regarding-investigation-ice-fatal-shooting-minneapolis">feds just took that away this morning</a>, and they’ve already decided who’s at fault. The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension was going to do an investigation to find out.</p>
<p>But I can tell you, the federal code provides that when there is a state criminal prosecution of a federal officer in Minnesota or any other state, the officer has the right to remove the case to federal court. So if Ross was charged in Hennepin County, he could remove the case to the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota, have a federal judge deal with his case. The code is explicitly predicting such a prosecution could take place. If there was immunity of an absolute nature, you wouldn’t need that section, right?</p>
<p><strong>The administration seems to argue that Ross is protected under the Supremacy Clause, which essentially says that states can’t charge a federal officer if the officer was acting within the scope of his duties. </strong></p>
<p>Do you think killing people is acting within the scope of their duties? What if they decided to kill the 435,000 people in the city of Minneapolis while they were here, would the Supremacy Clause give them a free pass? I don’t think so.</p>
<p>Also, if there was an actual independent investigation, and you apply the actual federal case law to this, and you concluded that Ross violated her rights by using excessive deadly force, he could be indicted federally. Now, nobody believes that would ever happen now: For a guy who talked a lot about rigged things, this [investigation] is rigged. Kash Patel took over the autopsy, so who knows, maybe they’ll say she died of a heart attack when she was backing up.</p>
<p><strong>If the officer isn’t charged criminally, the other route is a lawsuit. What are the challenges there?</strong></p>
<p>My team and I think there are ways to do it. I hope that her mother, or her next of kin, calls us and we’ll figure out a Bivens action or a Federal Tort Claims Act case, or something else. If you look at this case carefully, it has all the hallmarks of cases we’ve either won or settled for amounts of money no reasonable person would pay us if we weren’t going to win. It is essentially a garden variety unjustified use of deadly force case. And that’s based on the facts we know now; I bet the case is going to get better.</p>
