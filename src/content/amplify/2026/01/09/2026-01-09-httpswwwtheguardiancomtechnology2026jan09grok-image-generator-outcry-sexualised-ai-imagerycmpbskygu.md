<h2 data-gu-name="standfirst">X to limit editing function to paying subscribers after platform threatened with fines and regulatory action</h2>
<p>Grok, Elon Musk’s AI tool, has switched off its image creation function for the vast majority of users after widespread outcry over its use to create sexually explicit and violent imagery.</p>
<p>It comes after Musk was threatened with fines, regulatory action and reports of a possible <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2026/jan/09/grok-ai-create-sexually-violent-videos-featuring-women-research-finds">ban on X in the UK</a>.</p>
<p>The tool had been used to manipulate images of women to remove their clothes and put them in sexualised positions. The function to do so has now been switched off except for paying subscribers.</p>
<p>Posting on <a data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/twitter">X</a>, Musk’s social media network, Grok said: “Image generation and editing are currently limited to paying subscribers.”</p>
<p>This means the vast majority of users of the platform cannot create images using Grok, and those who do have their full details and credit card information stored by X, so can be identified if the function is misused.</p>
<p>Research revealed by the Guardian found it had been used to create pornographic videos of women without their consent as well as images of women being shot and killed.</p>
<p>Musk is facing the threat of regulatory action from around the world after Grok was used to create nonconsensual sexual imagery.</p>
<p>Keir Starmer, the UK prime minister, on Wednesday threatened to take strong action against the social media company.</p>
<p>He demanded X “get a grip” of the deluge of AI-created photos of partially clothed women and children on the platform, describing the content as “disgraceful” and “disgusting”.</p>
<p>Starmer said the communications regulator Ofcom “has our full support to take action in relation to this” He added: “It’s unlawful. We’re not going to tolerate it. I’ve asked for all options to be on the table. It’s disgusting. X need to get their act together and get this material down. We will take action on this because it’s simply not tolerable.”</p>
<p>Thousands of sexualised images of women have been created without their consent over the past two weeks, after the Grok image creation feature was updated at the end of December. Musk has faced repeated public calls to remove or restrict the feature, but until now the social media app has not acted.</p>
<p>X has been contacted for comment.</p>
