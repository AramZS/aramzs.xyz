title: Society for Hopeful Technologists
---
<h2> For everyone who wants technologies to work for people and planet. </h2>
<p>We are a solidarity network that:</p>
<ul> <li> <strong>Strengthens and activates Hopeful Technologists</strong>, so more people can make, advocate for and stand-up for the technology they believe in and want. </li> <li> <strong>Demystifies tech</strong>, by providing high-quality, accessible information about how technology works and its social, economic, and environmental impacts. </li> <li> <strong>Makes it easy for more technologists to be hopeful by sharing positive visions</strong>, skills, knowledge, resources and networks to inspire and support advocacy, ethical challenge, and share best practice. </li> </ul>
<p>The Society for Hopeful Technologists has grown rapidly through word-of-mouth in 2025. Starting as <a href="https://buttondown.com/justenoughinternet/archive/a-union-for-hopeful-technologists/">an idea in a newsletter</a>, we are now a community of more than 800 people and our vision has been shaped by the input of more than 100 Hopeful Technologists!</p>
<h2>Why Hopeful?</h2>
<p>As Rebecca Solnit says in <em>Hope in the Dark</em>, “Hope is an ax you break down the door with in an emergency”.</p>
<p>Findings from our 2025 survey of 522 <strong>UK tech workers show 98% don’t feel represented by leading industry voices</strong>, but only 15% are comfortable raising concerns.</p>
<p>Many tech workers need support and confidence to craft a more socially and environmentally positive future for technology – but it can be very easy to get stuck listing what’s wrong.</p>
<p>The Society for Hopeful Technologists exists to lift up and shape trustworthy and socially beneficial approaches to technology, and to amplify the hope and ambition of everyone who knows a better way is possible.</p>
