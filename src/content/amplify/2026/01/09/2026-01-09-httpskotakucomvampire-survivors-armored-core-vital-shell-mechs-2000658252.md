<p>Have you ever wondered what might happen if you put <i>Armored Core</i> and <i><a href="https://kotaku.com/castlevania-roguelike-vampire-survivors-steam-itch-io-1848402308">Vampire Survivors</a></i> into opposite ends of the teleporter from <i>The Fly</i> and flipped the switch? The resulting mash-up would probably look a lot like <i>Vital Shell</i>, a game by solo developer Marvin Wizard released to Steam on January 8.</p>
<p><i>Vital Shell</i>, fortunately, is less a monstrous example of scientific hubris and more a competent, top-down arena shooter that combines fantasy mechs with automatic battling mechanics and adds an aesthetic splash of PlayStation 1 visuals and ambient jungle music for good vibes. I spent a few rounds running the game through its paces after noticing its launch this morning and, folks, it’s pretty dang fun.</p>

<p>If you’ve played <i>Vampire Survivors</i>, you should mostly know what to expect here. <i>Vital Shell</i> places players in control of a giant robot and tasks them with destroying everything in their wake. What this looks like in practice is kiting waves of enemy hordes around a nondescript battlefield, persisting long enough to level up, and building an ever-improving kit of weaponry and upgrades for tackling the challenges ahead.</p>
<p>As fun as <i>Vital Shell</i> is gameplay-wise, it really excels in presentation. The level-up screen looks like something out of early installments of <i>Armored Core</i>, and the clean 3D graphics make it easy to distinguish friend from foe during raucous battles. Marvin Wizard also developed the game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3741860/view/506206686159048296">with a “console-first approach” from the beginning</a>, which means the menus are snappy and easy to navigate via controller. I first tried playing <i>Vital Shell</i> with mouse and keyboard but quickly switched to my trusty DualSense and haven’t looked back.</p>

<p><i>Vital Shell</i> is now available on Steam for $4.79 (the price goes up to $5.99 after January 21), alongside <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3928280/Vital_Shell_Demo_Disc/">a demo-disc-style preview</a> if you want to try before you buy. It’s a solo affair at the moment, but Marvin Wizard is exploring the addition of co-op in a future update.</p>
