title: Tailwind CSS Lets Go 75% Of Engineers After 40% Traffic Drop From AI

<p>Adam Wathan the creator of <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/">Tailwind CSS</a> posted that he had to let go of 75% (from 4 people now down to 1) of his engineering team because of AI. He said traffic to the Tailwind help documentation is down 40% and that is where most people learn about his solution and then buy commercial products. He added his revenue is down 80%.</p>
<p>He posted this in the <a href="https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss.com/pull/2388#issuecomment-3717222957">Github forums</a> where he wrote the sad story about the decline. Often, most of us think AI Search is only hurting news publishers and those who create content to drive sales. But it is also hurting software platforms that produce useful help documentation to improve the web.</p>
<p>Adam Wathan wrote, "the reality is that 75% of the people on our engineering team lost their jobs here yesterday because of the brutal impact AI has had on our business." "Traffic to our docs is down about 40% from early 2023 despite Tailwind being more popular than ever," he added. He then goes on to explain that "The docs are the only way people find out about our commercial products, and without customers we can't afford to maintain the framework."</p>
<p>This is all in response to adding an LLMS.txt feature, which he can't add because his development team is now 75% smaller. "I really want to figure out a way to offer LLM-optimized docs that don't make that situation even worse (again we literally had to lay off 75% of the team yesterday), but I can't prioritize it right now unfortunately, and I'm nervous to offer them without solving that problem first," he wrote. Yea, I wouldn't spend time on LLMs.txt now...</p>
<p>"Tailwind is growing faster than it ever has and is bigger than it ever has been, and our revenue is down close to 80%," he added at the end.</p>
<p>This is just so hard to hear. One of my developers at my company told me about this and we, <a href="https://www.rustybrick.com/">at RustyBrick</a>, are big fans of Tailwind CSS.</p>
<p>Again, most of us don't think about how so many verticals and niches are impacted in a really bad way by AI Search - but it goes far and wide. And at the same time, searchers want short AI-generated answers, so that is what Google will give them...</p>
<p>Here is the post:</p>

<p>Overwhelmed by the support over the last 24 hours, not something I was looking for and expecting when I recorded that podcast on a whim. Thanks so much to everyone with words of encouragement, the new sponsors we've brought on, and people who've used their platforms to help in any way, I'm extremely touched ❤️</p><p>I feel like I have to make it clear though that we've still got a fine business (even if things are trending down), just not a great one anymore. Had to make a really crushing change and did everything I could to do it in the most generous and gracious way possible, but at the new size we're okay. We're comfortable, and things like our partner program are helping a lot to fund the framework more directly instead of selling products that are more at risk of disruption. We don't need anyone to rescue us, we've got lots of time and space to try new ideas and see what works 🙏🏻</p><p>I'm optimistic we'll figure out how to get things moving in the right direction, but even if we just have be a smaller business with less budget than we've had in the past that's okay too ❤️<br/></p>

<p>Update 2: While Adam did not specifically say the traffic drop is from Google Search, I have to assume that to be the case. What other source of traffic can have such a devastating impact on a company? AI Overviews have shown, despite what Google has said, to hurt traffic to many publishers. I reached out to Adam to confirm this was specific with Google Search and not just AI built into coding platforms. I also replaced "Google" with "AI" in the headline of this story.</p>
