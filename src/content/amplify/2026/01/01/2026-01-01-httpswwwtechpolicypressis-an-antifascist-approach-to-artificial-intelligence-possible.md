<p>What is necessary to develop a future that is less hospitable to authoritarianism and, indeed, to fascism? How do we build collective power against authoritarian forms of corporate and state power? Is an alternative form of computing possible? <strong>Dan McQuillan</strong> is the author of <a href="https://bristoluniversitypress.co.uk/resisting-ai"><em>Resisting AI: An Anti-fascist Approach to Artificial Intelligence</em></a>, published in 2022 by Bristol University Press.</p>
<p><em>A transcript of this discussion is forthcoming.</em></p>
