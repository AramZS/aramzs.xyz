<p>Many of those leaving also serve in NASA’s core mission sets, according to the documents. Those leaving include 1,818 staff serving in mission areas like science or human space flight, with the rest performing mission support roles like IT, facilities management or finance.</p>
<p>“You’re losing the managerial and core technical expertise of the agency,” said Casey Dreier, chief of space policy at The Planetary Society. “What’s the strategy and what do we hope to achieve here?”</p>
<p>The departures follow a proposed White House <a data-tracking="mpos=center&amp;mid=ar_body&amp;lindex=5&amp;lcol=" href="https://www.nasa.gov/fy-2026-budget-request/">budget for 2026</a> that would slash NASA’s funding by 25 percent and cut over 5,000 staff. The cuts, if enacted by Congress, would force the agency to operate with <a data-tracking="mpos=center&amp;mid=ar_body&amp;lindex=6&amp;lcol=" href="https://www.planetary.org/articles/nasa-2026-budget-proposal-in-charts">the smallest budget</a> and staff since the early 1960s.</p>
<p>The losses are spread across each of NASA’s 10 regional centers, where much of the agency’s work is done and which focus on everything from planning astronaut missions to the moon to sending out deep space probes.</p>
<p>The Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland is set to lose the most staff at 607; Johnson Space Center in Texas will lose 366 staff; Kennedy Space Center in Florida will lose 311; and NASA headquarters in Washington will lose 307. Langley Research Center in Virginia will lose 281, Marshall Space Flight Center in Alabama will lose 279, and Cleveland’s Glenn Research Center will lose 191 staff.</p>
<p>In some instances, the cuts are aligned with White House goals. While losses at Goddard may seem high, for example, the White House in fact <a data-tracking="mpos=center&amp;mid=ar_body&amp;lindex=7&amp;lcol=" href="https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/fy-2026-budget-technical-supplement-002.pdf">hopes to cut</a> 1,414 staff at the science-focused center.</p>
<p>The rate of departures at other centers, however, suggests that the White House may end up losing staff who are key to their plans to send astronauts to the moon by mid-2027 and later to Mars. Both missions are technically complex and logistically complicated, with much work still yet to be done.</p>
