  School causes chaotic scene
---
<p>Minneapolis Public Schools said that out of an abundance of caution, there will be no school on Thursday or Friday due to safety concerns related to the woman who was fatally shot by an ICE agent.</p>
<p>The district said that all MPS-sponsored programs, activities, athletics, community education, including adult education, will be canceled. The district said it will not move to e-learning.</p>
<h2>Lockdown at Green Central Elementary</h2>
<p>Green Central Elementary School in south Minneapolis went into lockdown after the ICE shooting just a few blocks away.</p>
<p>“That was way too close to school to feel comfortable,” said Celia Mejia, whose daughter attends the school.</p>
<p>She and other parents raced to Green Central Elementary, which went under lockdown, to pick up their kids.</p>
<p>When asked how frightening the situation was, Julia Haas, who took her child home early, said, “As a parent, very, and as a human being very. Nobody should have to deal with this ever.”</p>
<h2>Roosevelt High School</h2>
<p>Apparent ICE agents were at a Minneapolis high school on Wednesday after federal agents shot and killed a woman earlier in the day.</p>
<p>A Roosevelt High School student told 5 EYEWITNESS NEWS that ICE agents pulled up to the entrance sometime during Wednesday afternoon, then blocked portions of the road.</p>
<p>Roosevelt High School is about three miles away from the intersection of 34th Street and Portland Avenue, where federal agents fatally shot 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good on Wednesday morning.</p>

<p>The student added that he saw ICE agents chasing people, adding that someone was tackled by federal agents.</p>
<p>A video from the scene shows a person lying on the ground, with federal agents surrounding them.</p>
