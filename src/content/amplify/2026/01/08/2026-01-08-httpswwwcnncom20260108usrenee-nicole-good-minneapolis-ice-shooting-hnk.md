<p>The woman <a href="https://www.cnn.com/us/live-news/minnesota-fraud-state-reps-testify-01-07-26?post-id=cmk4ah6c000003j6qp7b4uzf0">shot and killed</a> by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent in Minneapolis was a loving mother, a poet and a partner whose family – along with neighbors across her stunned city and strangers far beyond – is shocked by the circumstances surrounding her death.</p>
<p>Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old US citizen, was killed when an ICE agent <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/07/us/minneapolis-shooting-ice-video-analysis-vis">shot into her vehicle</a> during an encounter Wednesday morning.</p>
<p>Good’s ex-husband said she had just dropped off her 6-year-old son at school when she encountered the ICE agents, The <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ice-shooting-minneapolis-minnesota-9aa822670b705c89906f2c699f1d16c5">Associated Press</a> reported.</p>
<p>The victim tried to “weaponize her vehicle” to run over an officer near an ICE vehicle stuck on a snow-lined street before he opened fire, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said.</p>
<p>State and local officials have strongly disputed claims the shooting, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/07/us/video/mn-minnesota-shooting-timeline-digvid">captured on video</a>, was done in self-defense as tensions exploded amid this week’s deployment of some <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/05/us/ice-minnesota-immigration-federal-agents-somali">2,000 federal agents</a> as part of the latest surge in the Trump administration’s nationwide <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/06/us/minneapolis-ice-crackdown-what-we-know">immigration enforcement crackdown</a> and following claims of <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/05/us/minnesota-child-care-fraud-investigation">welfare fraud</a> in the Somali immigrant community.</p>
<p>Still, loved ones and leaders paused to remember the newcomer to Minnesota as “an amazing human being.”</p>
<p>“Renee was one of the kindest people I’ve ever known. She was extremely compassionate,” her mother, Donna Ganger, <a href="https://www.startribune.com/she-was-an-amazing-human-being-mother-identifies-woman-shot-killed-by-ice-agent/601559922">told the</a> Minnesota Star Tribune. “She’s taken care of people all her life … She was loving, forgiving and affectionate.”</p>

<p>Born in Colorado, Good moved to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ice-shooting-minneapolis-minnesota-9aa822670b705c89906f2c699f1d16c5">Minnesota last year</a> and lived in the Twin Cities with her partner, the Star Tribune <a href="https://www.startribune.com/she-was-an-amazing-human-being-mother-identifies-woman-shot-killed-by-ice-agent/601559922">reported</a>, citing Ganger.</p>
<p>A mother of three, Good had two children, ages 15 and 12, from her first marriage, The <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ice-shooting-minneapolis-minnesota-9aa822670b705c89906f2c699f1d16c5">Associated Press</a> reported. Her 6-year-old child’s father died in 2023, according to the Star Tribune. “There’s nobody else in his life,” the child’s grandfather told the newspaper.</p>

<p>After spending most of her life in Colorado, Good briefly moved to Kansas to live with her parents for a time after her husband – a military veteran – died, her father, Tim Ganger, told <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2026/01/07/minneapolis-shooting-ice/#link-SURGTB2STFFCHDMJI6NOUJTX6I">The Washington Post</a>.</p>
<p>“She had a good life, but a hard life,” he said. “She was a wonderful person.”</p>
<p>Good’s death hit her family especially hard because it was her older sister’s birthday, her uncle, Robert Ganger, told <a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.denver7.com%2Fnews%2Fnational-news%2Fminneapolis-woman-shot-dead-by-ice-agent-during-immigration-crackdown-was-from-colorado-springs&amp;data=05%7C02%7Ckelly.mccleary%40cnn.com%7C6be7c29782e046a9987408de4e88f18d%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C639034547504066871%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=7MMOfhIp%2Fi%2B%2Bl%2Fw%2FQ04Ucze4Bc5Qg2ixcAtCeNT6mxc%3D&amp;reserved=0">CNN affiliate KMGH</a>.</p>
<p>CNN has reached out to Good’s family.</p>

<p>A former neighbor in Kansas called Good and her family “lovely,” <a href="https://www.kctv5.com/2026/01/07/vehicle-involved-deadly-ice-agent-shooting-has-ties-kansas-city/">CNN affiliates KCTV</a> and <a href="https://www.kmbc.com/article/woman-killed-minneapolis-ice-shooting-kansas-city-ties/69940624">KMBC</a> reported.</p>
<p>She is “a neighbor who, you know, is not a terrorist. Not an extremist,” Joan Rose told KMBC. “That was just a mom who loved her kids, loved her spouse.”</p>
<p>On her social media accounts, Good described herself as a “poet and writer and wife and mom,” according to the AP. She recently said she was “experiencing Minneapolis,” posting a pride flag emoji on her Instagram account.</p>
<p>A Pinterest account with her name features photos of Good smiling and holding a young child against her cheek, along with saved posts about tattoos, hairstyles and home decorating.</p>

<p>Good also was a devoted Christian who took part in youth mission trips to Northern Ireland when she was younger, her ex-husband told the AP. She also loved to sing and participated in a chorus in high school before studying vocal performance in college, he said.</p>
<p>Good attended Old Dominion University in Virginia, graduating in 2020 with an English degree, the school said in a <a href="https://www.odu.edu/article/a-statement-president-brian-o-hemphill-phd">statement</a>. She appeared to have won a prize for her work in 2020, a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/oduenglishdept/posts/please-join-us-in-congratulating-the-winners-and-honorable-mentions-of-the-acade/3268664879824735/">Facebook post</a> from the school indicates.</p>
<p>A short bio mentions she hosted a podcast with her late second husband, Tim Macklin.</p>
<p>“May Renee’s life be a reminder of what unites us: freedom, love, and peace. My hope is for compassion, healing, and reflection at a time that is becoming one of the darkest and most uncertain periods in our nation’s history,” Old Dominion President Brian O. Hemphill said in the statement.</p>

<p>Hours after the shooting, throngs of neighbors gathered at a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/us/live-news/minnesota-fraud-state-reps-testify-01-07-26?post-id=cmk4j98mn00003b6ph6nwetaq">vigil</a> near the scene to remember Good and express their outrage at her killing. The group surrounded a makeshift shrine of flowers and candles and, at one point, chanted Good’s name.</p>
<p>“Say it once. Say it twice. We will not put up with ICE,” they also chanted. Some carried signs with messages such as: “Killer ICE off our streets.”</p>
<p>Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, a Democrat, urged residents to remain calm in the wake of “chaos” in the city.</p>
<p>“This is a moment where all of us in Minneapolis and beyond, we can rise to the occasion,” Frey said. “We can show them who we are. We can show them the kind of courage, bravery, love and compassion that makes Minneapolis and that makes America.”</p>
<p>Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, also a Democrat, offered condolences to Good’s family and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/us/live-news/minnesota-fraud-state-reps-testify-01-07-26#cmk4hwbtf000b3b6p4nu2fza6">vowed</a> his administration “is going to stop at nothing to seek accountability and justice.”</p>
