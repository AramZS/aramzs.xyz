title: How Hackers Are Fighting Back Against ICE

<p>ICE has been invading U.S. cities, targeting, <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/ice-wants-go-after-dissenters-well-immigrants">surveilling</a>, <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/immigration-dhs-american-citizens-arrested-detained-against-will">harassing</a>, <a href="https://www.opb.org/article/2025/12/06/vancouver-ice-alleged-crushing-legs/">assaulting</a>, <a href="https://kstp.com/kstp-news/local-news/woman-says-she-was-detained-by-ice-in-minneapolis-for-being-a-citizen-observer/">detaining</a>, and <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2025/12/estados-unidos-nuevas-investigaciones-revelan-violaciones-de-derechos-humanos-en-los-centros-de-detencion-de-alligator-alcatraz-y-krome-en-florida/">torturing</a> people who are undocumented immigrants. They also have <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/immigration-dhs-american-citizens-arrested-detained-against-will">targeted people</a> with <a href="https://www.opb.org/article/2025/10/30/tacoma-hillsboro-victor-cruz-ice-immigration-oregon-law-enforcement/">work permits</a>, <a href="https://truthout.org/articles/ice-kidnapped-my-neighbor-in-broad-daylight-the-aftermath-left-me-reeling/">asylum seekers</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/15/ice-lawsuit-violent-assault">permanent residents</a> (people holding “green cards”), <a href="https://sahanjournal.com/immigration/ice-arrest-cedar-riverside-minneapolis-somali-man/">naturalized citizens</a>, and <a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/opinion/outlook/article/i-m-citizen-ice-wrongfully-detained-me-21244415.php">even citizens by birth.</a> ICE has spent <a href="http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2026/01/ice-going-surveillance-shopping-spree">hundreds of millions of dollars on surveillance technology</a> to spy on anyone—and potentially everyone—in the United States. It can be hard to imagine how to defend oneself against such an overwhelming force. But a few enterprising hackers have started projects to do counter surveillance against ICE, and hopefully protect their communities through clever use of technology.</p>
<p>Let’s start with Flock, the company behind a number of <a href="https://sls.eff.org/technologies/automated-license-plate-readers-alprs">automated license plate reader</a> (ALPR) and other camera technologies. You might be surprised at how many Flock cameras there are in your community. Many large and small municipalities around the country have signed deals with Flock for license plate readers to track the movement of all cars in their city. Even though these deals are signed by local police departments, oftentimes ICE <a href="https://www.404media.co/ice-taps-into-nationwide-ai-enabled-camera-network-data-shows/">also gains access</a>.</p>
<p>Because of their ubiquity, people are interested in finding out where and how many Flock cameras are in their community. One project that can help with this is the <a href="https://www.hackster.io/news/colonel-panic-s-oui-spy-is-a-slick-bluetooth-low-energy-scanner-or-a-foxhunting-handset-c16927adad71">OUI-SPY</a>, a small piece of open source hardware. The OUI-SPY runs on a cheap Arduino compatible chip called an ESP-32. There are multiple programs available for loading on the chip, such as “Flock You,” which allows people to detect Flock cameras and “Sky-Spy” to detect overhead drones. There’s also “BLE Detect,” which detects various Bluetooth signals including ones from Axon, Meta’s Ray-Bans that <a href="https://github.com/sh4d0wm45k/glass-detect/blob/main/glass-detect/glass-detect.ino">secretly record you</a>, and more. It also has a mode commonly known as “fox hunting” to track down a specific device. Activists and researchers can use this tool to map out different technologies and quantify the spread of surveillance.</p>
<p>There’s also the <a href="https://wigle.net/">open source Wigle app</a> which is primarily designed for mapping out Wi-Fi, but also has the ability to make an audio alert when a specific Wi-Fi or Bluetooth identifier is detected. This means you can set it up to get a notification when it detects products from Flock, Axon, or other nasties in their vicinity.</p>
<p>One enterprising YouTuber, Benn Jordan, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp9MwZkHiMQ">figured out a way to fool Flock cameras</a> into not recording his license plate simply by painting some minor visual noise on his license plate. This is innocuous enough that any human will still be able to read his license plate, but it completely prevented Flock devices from recognizing his license plate as a license plate at the time. <a href="https://codes.findlaw.com/ca/vehicle-code/veh-sect-5201/">Some states</a> have outlawed drivers obscuring their license plates, so taking such action is not recommended.</p>
<p>Jordan later went on to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU1-uiUlHTo">discover hundreds of misconfigured Flock cameras</a> that were exposing their administrator interface without a password on the public internet. This would allow anyone with an internet connection to view a live surveillance feed, download 30 days of video, view logs, and more. The cameras pointed at parks, public trails, busy intersections, and even a playground. This was a massive breach of public trust and a huge mistake for a company that claims to be working for public safety.</p>
<p>Other hackers have taken on the task of open-source intelligence and community reporting. One interesting example is <a href="http://deflock.me">deflock.me</a> and <a href="https://alpr.watch/">alpr.watch</a>, which are crowdsourced maps of ALPR cameras. Much like the OUI-SPY project, this allows activists to <a href="https://www.atlasofsurveillance.org/">map out and expose Flock surveillance cameras</a> in their community.</p>
<p>There have also been several ICE reporting apps released, including apps to report ICE sightings in your area such <a href="https://stopice.net">Stop ICE Alerts</a>, <a href="https://iceout.org">ICEOUT.org</a>, and ICE Block. ICEBlock was <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/10/02/following-doj-pressure-apple-pulls-iceblock-from-the-app-store/">delisted by Apple at the request of Attorney General Pam Bondi</a>, a fact <a href="https://www.eff.org/cases/eff-v-doj-dhs-ice-tracking-apps">we are suing over</a>. There is also Eyes Up, an app to securely record and archive ICE raids, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-removes-app-archiving-videos-of-ice">which was taken down by Apple earlier this year.</a></p>
<p>Another interesting project documenting ICE and creating a trove of open-source intelligence is <a href="https://wiki.icelist.is/index.php?title=Main_Page">ICE List Wiki</a> which contains info on companies that have contracts with ICE, incidents and encounters with ICE, and vehicles ICE uses.</p>
<p>People without programming knowledge can also get involved. <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/2025/10/20/whistles-chicago-ice/">In Chicago, people used whistles to warn their neighbors that ICE was present</a> or in the area. Many people 3D-printed whistles along with instructional booklets to hand out to their communities, allowing a wider distribution of whistles and consequently earlier warnings for their neighbors.</p>
<p>Many hackers have started hosting digital security trainings for their communities or building <a href="https://activistchecklist.org/">web sites with security advice</a>, including how to <a href="https://www.reclaimcontrol.tech/">remove your data from the watchful eyes of the surveillance industry</a>. To reach a broader community, trainers have even started hosting trainings on how to defend their communities and what to do in an ICE raid in <a href="https://www.404media.co/ice-defense-training-on-fortnite-new-save-collective/">video games, such as Fortnight</a>.</p>
<p>There is also EFF’s own Rayhunter project for detecting cell-site simulators, about which <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/03/meet-rayhunter-new-open-source-tool-eff-detect-cellular-spying">we have written extensively</a>. Rayhunter runs on a cheap mobile hotspot and doesn’t require deep technical knowledge to use.</p>
<p>It’s important to remember that we are not powerless. Even in the face of a domestic law enforcement presence with massive surveillance capabilities and military-esque technologies, there are still ways to engage in surveillance self-defense. We cannot give into nihilism and fear. We must continue to find small ways to protect ourselves and our communities, and when we can, fight back.</p>
