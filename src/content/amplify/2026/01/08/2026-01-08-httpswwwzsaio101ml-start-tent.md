<h2>Congratulations!</h2>
<p>You're the proud owner of a new Moonlander. Thank you for picking our keyboard! If you've only ever used traditional keyboards, this tool can seem a bit intimidating, but don't worry: This guide will take you through everything you need to start your journey towards a more ergonomic writing experience.</p>
<p>Remember, this is a journey — a typing adventure, if you will. You've been typing with staggered, old-style keyboards for years; you'll quickly notice your bad habits when starting with a Moonlander. Don't fret: With this guide and practice, you'll be able to regain your typing speed and enjoy a keyboard that's perfectly customized for your individual needs. Soon you'll be left wondering why this isn't the standard layout!</p>
<p>As you progress through the tutorial, your progress will be saved across sessions, and the page will keep its scroll position and any "done" steps for your next visit.</p>
<p>Think of this like a lunar flight checklist. Many steps, but in the end, a brand-new feeling awaits. Take your time and work through the steps in sequence — that way you'll get the most out of your new Moonlander. 3, 2, 1, blastoff!</p>
