<p><strong>• Trump calls: </strong><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/26/politics/wh-minnesota-trump-ice-minneapolis">President Donald Trump has dispatched border czar </a>Tom Homan to run the enforcement operation in Minneapolis. Trump spoke <a href="https://www.cnn.com/us/live-news/minneapolis-shooting-ice-protests-01-26-26?post-id=cmkvb3stn00003b6pt8r2sxli">with Gov.

<p><strong>• Few details back claims: </strong>Federal officials have <a href="https://www.cnn.com/us/live-news/minneapolis-shooting-ice-protests-01-25-26?post-id=cmktsq5bm00003b6qr6bfmgab">declined</a> to provide critical details substantiating their claim that an agent shot ICU nurse <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/25/us/shooting-minneapolis-alex-pretti-killed">Alex Pretti</a> in self-defense. <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/25/politics/trump-officials-shifting-rhetoric-alex-pretti">Read CNN’s fact check</a> and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/25/us/video/minneapolis-ice-shooting-alex-pretti-visual-analysis-digvid">watch our analysis</a> of videos from several angles.</p>

<p>The Department of Homeland Security has suspended border patrol official Gregory Bovino’s access to his social media accounts effective immediately, according to a source familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>Bovino would use one X account, @CMDROpAtLargeCA, to post multiple times a day, trolling his critics, sharing mugshots of immigrants his officers arrested, and publicizing his own appearances at press conferences and on cable news.</p>
<p>Over the weekend, Bovino had <a href="https://www.cnn.com/us/live-news/minneapolis-shooting-ice-protests-01-25-26?post-id=cmkui0kwq00053b6q1qw08a42">scrapped with lawmakers and others online</a>, responding to their posts on X about the shooting of ICU nurse Alex Pretti. In <a href="https://x.com/CMDROpAtLargeCA/status/2015459749156835581">several</a> <a href="https://x.com/CMDROpAtLargeCA/status/2015477601737838988">recent</a> <a href="https://x.com/CMDROpAtLargeCA/status/2015461412319920542">posts</a> to social media, Bovino had accused Pretti of assaulting federal law enforcement officers before he was killed — a claim that is not supported by video of the moments leading up to his death.</p>
<p>Bovino is expected to depart Minneapolis tomorrow, and President Donald Trump said he is <a href="https://www.cnn.com/us/live-news/minneapolis-shooting-ice-protests-01-26-26?post-id=cmkv8h4l000003b6qpf2ho1sd">sending border czar Tom Homan</a> to lead the operation there.</p>
<p>The US Department of Education (DOE) and Health and Human Services (HHS) <a href="https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/us-departments-of-education-and-health-and-human-services-refer-minnesota-case-us-department-of-justice-title-ix-non-compliance">referred two Minnesota agencies to the Department of Justice</a> for their “refusal to comply with Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (Title IX) by allowing men to compete in women’s sports and occupy women’s intimate facilities.”</p>
<p><strong>What the statement from DOE and HHS says: </strong>The state agencies — Minnesota Department of Education (MDE) and the Minnesota State High School League (MSHSL) — were notified in September of their Title IX violations and asked to voluntarily resolve them or risk action. But Minnesota has indicated it won’t accept the proposed resolution or negotiate.</p>
<p>“As Minnesota reels from a massive fraud scandal exposing Governor Tim Walz’s dereliction of duty, today’s referral to DOJ underscores the state’s ongoing failure to safeguard its citizens and uphold the rule of law. The Trump Administration will not stop until accountability is delivered for Minnesota’s students,” said Linda McMahon, US Secretary of Education, in the statement.</p>
<p>“Minnesota is violating Title IX, and we will not look the other way,” said Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., US Secretary of Health and Human Services.</p>

<p>Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem will testify before Senate Judiciary Committee in March, according to Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin.</p>
<p>The hearing will take place March 3, Durbin, the ranking member on the panel, said in a statement today.</p>
<p><strong>Some context:</strong> Noem’s appearance comes as she defended the agents who shot Alex Pretti in Minneapolis over the weekend, saying the man <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/25/us/shooting-alex-pretti-gun-minneapolis">“brandished”</a> a firearm to officers. However, video from the incident appeared to a show an officer removing a gun from Pretti just prior to officers shooting him.</p>
<p>Plus, a DHS funding bill that is subject of debate in Congress right now includes newly negotiated accountability measures for ICE and Customs and Border Protection and reins in DHS Secretary Kristi Noem’s ability to unilaterally reprogram funding in her department. Democrats, who are trying to push back against ICE, are arguing the bill doesn’t do enough.</p>

<p>We’re learning more about the investigation into the fatal shooting of 37-year-old ICU nurse <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/24/us/alex-pretti-minneapolis-ice-shooting-invs">Alex Pretti</a> following a hearing today and recent court filings.</p>
<p>Pretti was shot dead by a Border Patrol agent on Saturday morning in Minneapolis. In the aftermath, there’s been confusion and conflict over which set of investigators would take the lead, culminating in state investigators going to court over the federal authorities’ handling of evidence.</p>
<p><em>Here’s the latest on what we know:</em></p>
<p><strong>Who was involved in the shooting? </strong>The federal agents involved in the shooting of Pretti were from US Customs and Border Protection. The individual officers haven’t been named.</p>
<p><strong>Who is investigating?</strong> The lead investigative federal agency is from the Department of Homeland Security’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement, federal officials have said. The US Customs and Border Protections’ Office of Professional Responsibility and the FBI are also assisting. The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) said, historically, it is the agency to investigate, and if federal law enforcement is involved, it would normally work in cooperation with the FBI. While the agency is involved, the sworn statements so far from federal officials appear to indicate the investigation is being handled as an internal review of DHS officers’ behavior, rather than being approached as a criminal investigation, especially given Minnesota’s ability to access evidence.</p>
<p><strong>What happened after the shooting:</strong></p>
<ul data-editable="items"> <li data-editable="items.0.text"> Pretti was transported to the Hennepin County Medical Center where he was pronounced dead, state officials said. </li> <li data-editable="items.1.text"> State investigators arrived at 9:30 a.m. CT Saturday, within an hour of the shooting happening — before even the FBI arrived, the state has said. </li> <li data-editable="items.2.text"> ICE arrived at approximately 9:42 a.m. CT. ICE officials weren’t involved in the shooting, the agency said, but went to help secure a perimeter. </li> <li data-editable="items.3.text"> DHS officials, which appear to be the ICE officials who locked down the perimeter, blocked the BCA crime scene personnel from entering the scene, as the state wanted to gather evidence. </li> <li data-editable="items.4.text"> The FBI took possession of “a mobile phone and a firearm belonging to the deceased” Pretti, according to the lead DHS official overseeing the investigation into the shooting. </li> <li data-editable="items.5.text"> Minnesota investigators went to court to obtain a warrant just before noon CT on Saturday from a judge to access the evidence and the scene of the shooting. DHS officers still did not allow Minnesota investigators access the scene, the state said. </li> </ul>
<p><strong>What happened to the evidence?</strong></p>
<ul data-editable="items"> <li data-editable="items.0.text"> DHS investigators now have access to Pretti’s phone, the Homeland Security investigations’ special agent in charge said. </li> <li data-editable="items.1.text"> The FBI is involved primarily in keeping the evidence from the scene of the shooting. The FBI collected evidence from the shooting near Nicollet Avenue, and from other places around Minneapolis. </li> <li data-editable="items.2.text"> An FBI official swore in court today that “evidence was packaged by trained evidence collectors” who wore the correct personal equipment and packaged the evidence in tamper-proof evidence tape. </li> <li data-editable="items.3.text"> Evidence the FBI collected is now in a secure evidence room with controlled access in the FBI’s Minneapolis Field Office. </li> <li data-editable="items.4.text"> <strong>Body camera footage:</strong> CBP officers in Minnesota do wear body cameras, and the agency is preserving the body-worn camera footage from the shooting at this time. Those records must be kept for 75 years, the agency said. </li> </ul>
<p>Sara Misner’s family only crossed paths with <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/24/us/alex-pretti-minneapolis-ice-shooting-invs">Alex Pretti</a> briefly, while the ICU nurse cared for her father as he suffered sepsis.</p>
<p>But even in those few days, he made “such a poignant impact on us,” she told CNN’s Jake Tapper Monday.</p>
<p>Pretti was “this wonderful, warm, welcoming presence,” Misner said of Pretti, who treated veterans at the Minneapolis VA Medical Center.</p>
<p>“He made me feel like he cared so deeply for my dad and myself,” she went on. He was “so patient and kind with us.”</p>
<p>When she saw the news that Pretti had been killed, her reaction was swift.</p>
<p>“I thought, I’ve got to have people know the truth about him,” she said. “People have to know that I know that he was a wonderful person.”</p>
<p>It was “maddening” to see the federal government quickly smear Pretti as a “domestic terrorist” in the hours after the shooting, she said.</p>

<p>A federal appeals court today refused to reinstate a judge’s order that sought to put guardrails on how federal agents can operate around peaceful protesters in Minnesota.</p>
<p>The ruling by the Eighth US Circuit Court of Appeals is a major victory for the Trump administration in one of several lawsuits brought against it amid an aggressive immigration crackdown in the Twin Cities that has ignited weeks of protests against federal agents carrying it out.</p>
<p>A three-judge panel said in the brief, unsigned ruling that a federal judge in Minneapolis had overstepped when she issued a sweeping preliminary injunction this month saying federal agents working in Operation Metro Surge were not allowed to arrest peaceful protesters or stop people in their cars without cause, among other things.</p>
<p>The ruling from US District Judge Katherine Menendez, the appeals court concluded, was overbroad and vague, and contained several other errors. The appeals court had already temporarily frozen the lower-court ruling while it considered whether to indefinitely shelve it.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://x.com/agpambondi/status/2015932965528764622?s=46">a statement</a> touting the ruling, US Attorney General Pam Bondi said the appeals court “has fully agreed that this reckless attempt to undermine law enforcement cannot stand.”</p>
<p>Though Bondi appeared to acknowledge the lower-court ruling had stymied federal agents’ activity in Minnesota, earlier this month, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said the ruling had no practical effect because, she said, officials weren’t doing the types of things the judge was trying to prevent.</p>
<p>“That federal order was a little ridiculous, because that federal judge came down and told us we couldn’t do what we already aren’t doing,” Noem said at the time.</p>
<p>The appeals court comprises two appointees of former President George W. Bush and an appointee of President Donald Trump. Judge Raymond Gruender, one of the Bush appointees, said in a partial dissent he would have revived a part of the lower-court ruling that barred federal agents from using pepper spray and other non-lethal munitions against peaceful protesters.</p>
<p>The government, Gruender wrote, had not shown that trained agents would be unable to understand that directive.</p>
<p><em>This post was updated with comments from Bondi and context around Noem’s previous remarks.</em></p>

<p>Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said he spoke to President Donald Trump this afternoon in the aftermath of Saturday’s fatal Border Patrol shooting of 37-year-old Alex Pretti.</p>
<aside data-article-gutter="true" data-component-name="pull-quote" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/pull-quote/instances/cmkvql5md001m3b6p2r6w62x2@published"> <p data-editable="text"> “I expressed how much Minneapolis has benefited from our immigrant communities and was clear that my main ask is that Operation Metro Surge needs to end. The president agreed that the present situation cannot continue,” Frey said in a statement. </p> </aside>
<p>CNN has reached out to the White House about Frey’s claim that Trump agreed the present situation can’t continue.</p>
<p>Frey said he plans to meet with border czar Tom Homan tomorrow.</p>
<p>While Minneapolis city officials will cooperate with state and federal agencies on “real criminal investigations,” they will “not participate in unconstitutional arrests of our neighbors or enforce federal immigration law,” Frey’s statement added.</p>
<p><a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115963713974102712">Trump posted on Truth Social</a> about a “very good telephone conversation” he had with Frey.</p>
<p>“Lots of progress is being made! Tom Homan will be meeting with him tomorrow in order to continue the discussion,” Trump added.</p>
<p>In an exchange on X, Border Patrol official Greg Bovino challenged CNN’s Jake Tapper to identify past instances where he lied. A federal judge in a November ruling found that Bovino lied “multiple times” about events surrounding his deployment of tear gas in a Chicago neighborhood.</p>
<p><em>Tapper goes through key excerpts from the judge’s ruling.</em></p>

<figure><picture><img alt="Marimar Martinez shows her bullet scar during an interview on November 21." src="https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/still-22139829-112868-498-still.jpg?c=original&amp;q=w_1280,c_fill/f_avif"/></picture><figcaption>Marimar Martinez shows her bullet scar during an interview on November 21.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Marimar Martinez, a Chicago woman who <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/21/us/marimar-martinez-shooting-case-what-we-know">was shot five times</a> by a Customs and Border Protection agent last year, is asking a judge to allow her to share body camera footage and other evidence from her case, saying she believes it will shed light on federal agents’ use of deadly force after the fatal shootings of two people in Minneapolis.</p>
<p>Even though a federal case against Martinez was dropped in November, she believes the evidence “would be useful for both the public and elected officials to know regarding how DHS responds in cases where their agents use deadly force against U.S. citizens,” according to a motion filed by her attorney, Christopher Parente.</p>
<p>Parente cited the killings of Alex Pretti and Renee Good, whose shootings have been the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/25/politics/trump-officials-shifting-rhetoric-alex-pretti">source of massive disagreement</a> over whether agents’ deadly use of force was justified.</p>
<p>The government had initially charged Martinez, a US citizen, with assaulting a federal officer and accused her of aggressively pursuing and ramming a CBP agent with her car.</p>
<p>But Martinez alleged it was actually the agent who sideswiped her before opening fire.</p>
<p>After a judge raised several concerns about the handling of the investigation, the US Attorney’s Office dropped the case, saying it is “constantly evaluating new facts and information” in immigration enforcement-related cases.</p>
<p>Parente is asking a judge to lift a court order preventing the public release of body camera footage, photos, electronic communications, and other evidence.</p>
<p>Martinez hopes the evidence could also be used to “defend herself from a regrettable and unyielding tide of misinformation from the federal government regarding her case,” the motion states.</p>
<p>Democrats pushing back against ICE may not have as much power as one mightthink to defund Trump’s immigration enforcement around the country.</p>
<p>Last Thursday seven House Democrats voted with Republicans to fund the agency. Now, in the last 72 hours following the death of Alex Pretti in Minneapolis, Democrats are arguing a DHS funding bill that includes newly negotiated accountability measures for ICE and Customs and Border Protection doesn’t do enough.</p>
<p>However, the appropriations package expected to come to the floor Thursday isn’t just a spending package for DHS. The multi-bill package also includes funding for the Defense Department and various other agencies.</p>
<p>Democrats are urging Majority Leader John Thune to pull DHS from that package, renegotiate it and pass the remaining bills to blunt the impact. But it’s not clear Republicans have any appetite to take that approach.</p>
<p><strong>What it could mean for DHS: </strong>There are several reasons Democrats may not have much power to restrict ICE activities in the event of a shutdown. Multiple congressional aides contend that even in a shutdown scenario ICE would still continue to operate its main functions. The passage of the president’s signature bill last summer also injected tens of billions of dollars into the agency, giving DHS Secretary Kristi Noem wide-ranging power to move money around to carry out the agency’s operations.</p>
<p>Guidance from DHS back in the fall during that last shutdown showed that of the estimated 271,927 DHS employees, just a fraction — 22,862– would be furloughed under their shutdown plan. More than 93% of ICE and CBP workers would be retained during a lapse, according to the plan.</p>
<p><em>CNN’s Tami Luhby contributed reporting.</em></p>
<p>Hearing the news that top Border Patrol official <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/25/politics/gregory-bovino-minneapolis-immigration-crackdown">Gregory Bovino</a>, who has become the face of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/26/politics/gregory-bovino-minnneapolis-exit-ice">will be leaving Minneapolis</a> tomorrow, one demonstrator’s reaction was swift: “Good riddance.”</p>
<p>His departure “couldn’t have came sooner,” Susan Montgomery told CNN Monday afternoon at the site where ICU nurse <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/25/us/shooting-minneapolis-alex-pretti-killed">Alex Pretti</a> was fatally shot this weekend.</p>
<p>Still, “(Bovino) came to our community and caused all this damage,” added Montgomery, who held a sign saying “Where is your moral compass?”</p>
<p>“It doesn’t just go away because he leaves – and then who comes next and what happens next doesn’t give the answers to the murder, the senseless murder of Alex or Renee.”</p>

<p>President Donald Trump indicated today there may be a shift in how his administration will handle its immigration crackdown in Minnesota following a call with Gov. Tim Walz today.</p>
<p>“It was a very good call, and we, actually, seemed to be on a similar wavelength,” Trump wrote on <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115962378381121858">Truth Social</a>, striking <a href="https://www.cnn.com/us/live-news/minneapolis-shooting-ice-protests-01-26-26?post-id=cmkvb3stn00003b6pt8r2sxli">a notably conciliatory tone</a>.</p>
<p>In a separate statement, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/us/live-news/minneapolis-shooting-ice-protests-01-26-26?post-id=cmkveyjxh00053b6pqoq1uj6s">Walz said</a> Trump agreed to consider reducing the number of federal agents in Minnesota and pledged to talk to his Department of Homeland Security about ensuring that state officials can investigate Saturday’s fatal shooting of <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/24/us/alex-pretti-minneapolis-ice-shooting-invs">Alex Pretti</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Trump said he is sending <a href="https://www.cnn.com/us/live-news/minneapolis-shooting-ice-protests-01-26-26?post-id=cmkvhbt6700003b6p0ykl5c8c">border czar Tom Homan to Minnesota</a>.

<p>Top Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino and some of his agents are expected to leave Minneapolis tomorrow and return to their respective sectors, according to three sources familiar the discussions, sidelining a key player in the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.</p>
<p>The move comes after President Donald Trump announced he was dispatching White House border czar Tom Homan to Minneapolis in the wake of Saturday’s fatal shooting. The White House has said Homan is expected to manage ICE operations in the city. One official said it was a “mutual decision” to have Bovino depart.</p>
<p>CNN reached out to the Department of Homeland Security for comment.</p>
<p>Administration officials were left deeply frustrated this weekend over how Bovino and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem handled the fallout from the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti in Minneapolis, sources said. According to one official, Trump spent several hours on Sunday and Monday watching the coverage and was personally unhappy by how his administration was coming across. CNN has previously reported that Noem was in touch with the White House throughout the day Saturday.</p>
<p>Others say that Bovino, who became the face of Trump’s immigration enforcement operation in Minnesota, only made matters worse by claiming Pretti intended to “massacre” federal agents. He sat for an interview with CNN and held a press conference with reporters Sunday, but neither appearance tamped down criticism of the administration’s response and contradictions, officials told CNN.</p>
<p>Senior officials began discussing taking Bovino out of Minnesota Sunday afternoon, according to one senior official.</p>
<p>Aides were also irked after Noem labeled Pretti a domestic terrorist and accused him of brandishing his firearm, a claim that wasn’t backed up by video evidence.</p>
<p>Press secretary Karoline Leavitt distanced the White House from the domestic terrorist label during Monday’s briefing, arguing it was not a position Trump himself has personally taken. She did not say specifically that Bovino was departing Minnesota. But she said that Homan would be the “main point of contact on the ground in Minneapolis,” and Bovino would “continue to lead” the Border Patrol agency nationwide.</p>
<p>Minnesota’s attorney general is confident his office made a solid <a href="https://www.cnn.com/us/live-news/minneapolis-shooting-ice-protests-01-26-26?post-id=cmkv69aaj0000356q95h78h2h">case before a federal judge</a> Monday that the court should halt the federal government’s immigration enforcement surge in the Minneapolis area, he told reporters after the court hearing.</p>
<p>“(My office) made the case … that our state has every right to have our own laws, have our own policies, and that the federal government doesn’t have any right to try to flood us, threaten us with retribution, and to coerce the state of Minnesota into complying with Trump policy,” Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said.</p>
<p>Ellison’s comments came after a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/us/live-news/minneapolis-shooting-ice-protests-01-26-26?post-id=cmkv7e12r0000356qino5e5h3"><strong>US District Court hearing</strong></a> related to a <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mnd.230268/gov.uscourts.mnd.230268.1.0_1.pdf"><strong>lawsuit</strong></a> in which Minnesota and the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul seek an end to Operation Metro Surge, the federal government’s influx of immigration enforcement officers into the Minneapolis area.</p>
<p>The plaintiffs first want a temporary restraining order that would halt the operation while the suit plays out.</p>
<p>“At the end of the day, I stand here with <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/25/us/renee-good-family-lawyers-case">Renee Good </a>in my heart and in my mind, and with with <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/25/us/alex-pretti-shooting-minneapolis-videos-witnesses-invs">Alex Pretti</a> in my heart, in my mind, and their families,” Ellison said, referring to two US citizens fatally shot by federal agents in Minneapolis this month.</p>
<p>Ellison said he also stood with other people in the Minneapolis area who he said have suffered — including those he said who’ve been racially profiled, been unfairly detained, or who have shuttered businesses out of fear — because of the surge of immigration officers.</p>
<p>Monday’s hearing <a href="https://www.cnn.com/us/live-news/minneapolis-shooting-ice-protests-01-26-26?post-id=cmkvg56xu0013356p6ovmzwfo">ended without a decision from the judge</a>, and it’s not clear when she will rule.</p>
<p>Court proceedings are unveiling new details about the scope of immigration operations in Minnesota.</p>
<p>The Justice Department said a total of 4,000 federal agents have been surged to the state, with about 2,000 coming from ICE and 2,000 coming from Customs and Border Protection. A specific number is to be provided to a federal judge some time later today.</p>
<p>A judge heard arguments today on whether to temporarily halt the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/25/politics/immigration-enforcement-strategy-cracks-emerge">immigration crackdown</a> in Minnesota. Separately, a federal court hearing is set for later this afternoon after a judge issued a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/us/live-news/minneapolis-shooting-ice-protests-01-25-26?post-id=cmktiweej00003b6pt2422fjm">temporary restraining order</a> blocking federal agencies from destroying or altering evidence related to Pretti’s killing.</p>
<p>While some officers at the Pretti shooting were wearing body cameras, an ICE official said there are not body cameras for ICE agents operating out of St. Paul.</p>
<p>It would take 180 days to equip the 2,000 ICE agents in the Twin Cities with body cameras, an administration official said in court recently, and there are no body-worn camera devices physically in the Enforcement and Removal Operations’ St. Paul office, where the ICE officers are stationed.</p>
<p>“ICE would have to physically transport the devices from their current locations in other parts of the country to Minnesota,” an official said in <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mnd.230268/gov.uscourts.mnd.230268.35.2.pdf">a sworn court document</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mnd.230268/gov.uscourts.mnd.230268.35.1.pdf">another sworn document</a>, a CBP official said his agency’s personnel uses body cameras “except when doing so may jeopardize agents and officers or public safety.” Federal agents in Minnesota who have a camera “have been instructed to have their body-worn camera on their person for use in operations,” it said.</p>

<p>The White House said it does not support separating funding for the Department of Homeland Security from <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/25/politics/minneapolis-shooting-government-shutdown-funding-congress">a House-passed, six-bill appropriations package</a> the Senate is set to vote on this week, as the prospect of a partial government shutdown grows.</p>
<aside data-article-gutter="true" data-component-name="pull-quote" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/pull-quote/instances/cmkvkn1gh00043b6pt4a8aiob@published"> <p data-editable="text"> “At this point, the White House supports the bipartisan work that was done to advance the bipartisan appropriations package, and we want to see that passed,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters at a press briefing Monday. </p> </aside>
<p>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer announced Saturday evening that Democrats <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/25/politics/minneapolis-shooting-government-shutdown-funding-congress">won’t provide the votes needed</a> to pass the key package if it includes the current DHS funding measure, which he called “woefully inadequate to rein in the abuses of (Immigrations and Customs Enforcement).”</p>
<p>Schumer is demanding Senate Majority Leader John Thune separate the Department of Homeland Security bill from the other five bills in the funding package.</p>
<p>Leavitt said Trump is leading “policy discussions on immigration in Minnesota,” but they “should not be at the expense of government funding for the American people.”</p>
<p>She added that the package includes funding for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which is within DHS. “We are in the midst of <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/26/weather/winter-storm-deaths-power-outages">the storm</a> that took place over the weekend, and many Americans are still being impacted by that, so we absolutely do not want to see that funding lapse,” she said.</p>
<p>Lawmakers face a January 30 federal funding deadline.</p>
<p>The Trump administration’s shift in tone on Minneapolis is “encouraging” because it signals “they’re recognizing just the complete disaster that this operation has been” for the city and the US Constitution, City Council President Elliott Payne told CNN today.</p>
<p>“It’s encouraging to see their their tone shifting but we need to recognize that the city of Minneapolis are just people looking out for each other<strong>,</strong> looking out for their neighbors and exercising their rights. And if that makes us domestic terrorists, then we’re in a completely different universe when it comes to the future of our country,” Payne added.</p>
<p><strong>For context: </strong>President Donald Trump struck a notable shift in his tone when he said today that Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz called him “with the request to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/us/live-news/minneapolis-shooting-ice-protests-01-26-26?post-id=cmkvb3stn00003b6pt8r2sxli">work together</a>” and that he facilitated a call between Walz and border czar Tom Homan. Walz said <a href="https://www.cnn.com/us/live-news/minneapolis-shooting-ice-protests-01-26-26?post-id=cmkveyjxh00053b6pqoq1uj6s">Trump agreed to consider reducing</a> the number of federal agents in Minnesota and pledged to talk to the Department of Homeland Security about ensuring state officials can <a href="https://www.cnn.com/us/live-news/minneapolis-shooting-ice-protests-01-26-26?post-id=cmkvhtv8d00003b6pefpvefij">investigate</a> Saturday’s fatal shooting.</p>

<p>White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the administration could pull back on the deployment of US Customs and Border Protection in Minnesota if state officials cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents on the ground.</p>
<p>President Donald Trump <a href="https://www.cnn.com/us/live-news/minneapolis-shooting-ice-protests-01-25-26?post-id=cmku9lcip00053b6p3zxx8jzf">has called for</a> more cooperation from Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, including that they “turn over” all undocumented immigrants incarcerated in the state to federal authorities.</p>
<p>“If Gov. Walz and Mayor Frey implement these commonsense cooperative measures, CBP will no longer be needed to support ICE on the ground in Minnesota,” Leavitt said during today’s White House press briefing.</p>
<aside data-article-gutter="true" data-component-name="pull-quote" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/pull-quote/instances/cmkviyjp7000j3b6pss6azf3l@published"> <p data-editable="text"> “ICE and local law enforcement will peacefully work together as they are effectively doing in so many other states and jurisdictions to remove violent criminals from American neighborhoods across the country,” she added. </p> </aside>
<p><strong>Remember:</strong> A surge of federal immigration officers in Minnesota has left the Midwestern state on edge for weeks, with Saturday’s fatal shooting of <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/24/us/alex-pretti-minneapolis-ice-shooting-invs">Alex Pretti</a> in an encounter with Border Patrol officers marking the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/08/us/renee-nicole-good-minneapolis-ice-shooting-hnk">second time</a> a US citizen has been fatally shot by federal law enforcement this month. Border Patrol is an agency within Customs and Border Protection.</p>
<p>White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt called President Donald Trump a strong supporter of Americans’ Second Amendment rights, days after Trump and other officials questioned why Alex Pretti was carrying a firearm prior to being fatally shot by federal agents.</p>
<p>“There has been no greater supporter or defender of the right to bear arms than President Donald J. Trump,” she said during a White House press briefing.</p>
<p>Still, Leavitt qualified her statement by cautioning that “Americans do not have a right to impede lawful immigration enforcement operations,” and blamed Pretti for inviting the altercation that led to his death.</p>
<p>“Any gun owner knows that when you are carrying a weapon, when you are bearing arms, and you are confronted by law enforcement, you are raising the assumption of risk and the risk of force being used against you,” Leavitt said. “And again, that’s unfortunately what took place on Saturday.”</p>
<p>Trump in a Truth Social post over the weekend questioned why Pretti had been carrying a gun and additional magazines. FBI Director Kash Patel also sought to shift blame on Sunday, saying in an interview that “you cannot bring a firearm loaded with multiple magazines to any sort of protest.”</p>
<p>Tom Homan, the White House border czar, will now be the “main point of contact on the ground in Minneapolis,” press secretary Karoline Leavitt said.</p>
<p>Trump said today he is sending Tom Homan to Minnesota this evening, following Saturday’s fatal shooting of Alex Pretti.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, top Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino will “continue to lead” the agency nationwide, Leavitt said.</p>
<p>Bovino’s heavy-handed enforcement style has been supported by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem but has also drawn criticism. He has been seen in Minneapolis amid heightened tensions in recent weeks.</p>
