<p>For many, a snowstorm is a time to batten down the hatches, stock up on food and hibernate until it's over. But apparently some of those hibernators choose <em>not</em> to stock up — instead relying on app-based delivery workers to brave the storm for them.</p>
<p>Streetsblog reporters who were out and about on Sunday saw countless delivery workers biking on barely plowed streets and bike lanes. Los Deliveristas Unidos founder Gustavo Ajche <a href="https://x.com/AjcheGustavo/status/2015436885766648112">took to X</a> to implore delivery ordering New Yorkers to "please be generous" with tips.</p>

<p>By Sunday night, however, DoorDash and Grubhub had shut down their operations, promising to come back online on Monday morning (<a href="https://pix11.com/news/local-news/doordash-suspends-service-in-nyc-due-to-snow/">PIX 11)</a>.</p>
<p>In other delivery news, workers braving the snow and cold this week should at least have more money in their pockets after judges threw out lawsuits from DoorDash, UberEats and Instacart late on Friday.</p>
<p>In one case, a judge rejected the apps' bid to overturn the city's new mandatory up-front tipping rule, which goes into effect today. Moving the tipping option to <em>after</em> checkout led to <a href="https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2026/01/13/delivery-apps-have-stolen-550m-from-workers-by-changing-how-customers-tip-report">more than $550 million lost in wages</a>, the city's Department of Consumer and Worker Protection reported this month.</p>
<p>In a separate case, a judge threw out a bid from Instacart to stop a <a href="https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/09/02/instacart-now-claims-it-supports-worker-minimum-wage-that-it-fought-to-defeat-experts-see-corporate-spin">law</a>, also going into effect on Monday, that requires grocery delivery companies to comply with the city's delivery worker minimum wage rules.</p>
<p>DCWP Commissioner Sam Levine said in a statement that the bad old days "are over."</p>
<p>"We look forward to enforcing Local Laws 107 and 108 to ensure that workers get paid, and consumers have the option to tip freely," he added.</p>
<p>In other storm news, Mayor Mamdani and Gov. Hochul had wisely <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmdQgEyCua4">advised New Yorkers</a> to stay home during the storm. Those who had to or chose to navigate the city on Sunday faced significant subway <a href="http://amny.com/nyc-transit/nyc-transit-snow-avoid-unnecessary-travel/">delays</a> and hindered access to buses, which also experienced delays and reroutes, MTA Chairman Janno Lieber said.</p>

<p>The mayor, meanwhile, spent Sunday making his presence known as the snow piled up. Videos <a href="https://x.com/jacobkornbluh/status/2015507552541241766">circulated</a> on social showed Hizzoner shoveling drivers out of their parking spots <a href="https://www.cityandstateny.com/personality/2020/01/cuomo-the-hero/176555/">à la Andrew Cuomo</a>. Local political powerbroker Moshe Indig hilariously called the obvious photo op "not a photo op":</p>

<p>The city's Plow.nyc streets tracker showed frequent plowing throughout the day in most parts of the city, but plows failed to keep up for much of the day with the fast pace of the snowfall, as Streetsblog Editor-in-Chief Gersh Kuntzman saw on the 10th Avenue bike lane in Manhattan just before 3 p.m.</p>

<p>As the city clears the snow from the most vital parts of the road, sneckdowns will appear across the five boroughs. <a href="https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2026/01/23/send-mayor-mamdani-your-sneckdown-photos-snow-problem-streetsblog">As we explained on Friday</a>, big snowstorms tend to reveal huge swaths of public space that drivers simply don't use — they appear as piles of snow and show us all exactly where <em><a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/neckdown">neckdowns</a></em> could easily be built. Hence, "sneckdown."</p>
<p>Reporter Dave Colon asked the mayor if he knew what a sneckdown was at a press conference on Friday. (The mayor didn't, so we told him.) As the snow clears and you come across sneckdowns this week, take photos, send them to <a href="mailto:tips@streetsblog.org">tips@streetsblog.org</a> or post them online and tag Streetsblog and the mayor.</p>
