<p>The Grolier Club, a hidden gem on New York’s Upper East Side, serves as a world-class destination and private club for bibliophiles.</p>
<p><strong>[nutgraph]</strong> Founded in 1884, it is one of the world’s most important societies devoted to books. Though it operates as a members-only institution, the club maintains a steady program of free, public exhibitions that draw from its members’ collections. Though often historical, there are fascinating intersections with contemporary culture. Focused on rare books, manuscripts, and literary ephemera, these shows often illuminate how historical texts continue to shape the present.</p>
<p>Take its newest exhibition, Paper Jane: 250 Years of Austen, which traces Jane Austen’s quarter-millennium legacy through books, letters, and a wide range of archival material. The mere mention of Austen still conjures contemporary touchstones—from class-conscious comedies of manners to sweeping Hollywood adaptations starring figures like Colin Firth and Kate Winslet.</p>
<p>Organized by three Grolier members over the course of three years, the exhibition charts Austen’s rise from relative anonymity to her posthumous ascension into the literary canon. While she is now often described as the grandmother of “chick lit,” the show makes clear that her global fame was far from inevitable.</p>

<h4><strong>Into the World of Rare Books</strong></h4>
<p>Mary Crawford, who is one of the members sharing her collection for the show, explained how she and co-organizers Janine Barchas, a professor at the University of Texas in Austin; and Sandra Clark, an avid collector of Austen editions approached the project. They worked with and also members of JASNA (the Jane Austen Society of North America). “We each had a specific collecting focus. No single one of us could have covered the full 250 year history individually,” she said. Almost every object in the show is a direct loan from the trio.</p>
<p>The club’s origins date back to when New York book collector and printer Robert Hoe invited eight fellow book lovers to his home to discuss forming a club devoted to the “book arts.” Soon after, a suggestion to take French bibliophile Jean Grolier’s name was unanimously adopted.</p>
<p>Crawford described it as the oldest private club for bibliophiles, and “probably at the apex in the world for book collecting clubs.” There are an estimated 800 members worldwide, with roughly 200 in the New York area.</p>
<p>While it is entirely funded and supported by its members, admission to exhibitions—seven per year—is completely free.<strong> It is a different tack than other private member clubs with an arts focus.</strong> “It’s a hybrid,” says Crawford. “We want to spread the love of books.”</p>
<p><strong>Throughout its long history, it has presented </strong>more than 800 exhibitions, ranging from shows on Homer, Rudyard Kipling, and Mark Twain, to in-depth looks at flowers, chess, the War of 1812, and <a href="https://news.artnet.com/art-world/how-19th-century-guidebooks-shaped-the-way-visitors-saw-new-york-2616523">early New York City Tourism guidebooks.</a></p>

<p>When Austen died in 1817 at the age of 41, she was relatively unknown. Four of her novels, starting with <em>Sense and Sensibility</em> in 1811, were published simply as “by a Lady.”</p>
<p>Following her death, her older brother Henry penned a biographical notice on the front of two books. Her siblings saved all of her letters, which were then passed on to a plethora of admiring heirs.</p>
<p>When <em>Sense and Sensibility</em> was first published, the price was more than the average weekly wage, essentially making it a luxury good. So her family’s posthumous push for her recognition, along with advances in printing that lowered prices and increased distribution,helped the novels go from elaborate, pricey editions, favored by aristocrats, to affordable and widely-distributed paperbacks.</p>

<p>The exhibition at Grolier is organized chronologically into five sections spanning 50-year intervals, many of which track with major changes in print production. Objects on view, which the curators deem an “irreverant” mix, range from an 1811 first edition of <em>Sense and Sensibility</em> to cheaper, post-copyright expiration copies, illustrations, material related to the movie adaptations, and an extensively detailed Austen family tree.</p>
<p>Crawford said the collaboration with Barchas and Clark, the two other members and collectors, has been illuminating: “Something magical happens when people come together, each with a different viewpoint.”</p>
