  When the Colombian army sent a secret message to prisoners by creating a hit
  pop song

<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DT3m1AzEcYF/">Vlogger Reuben Levine</a> tells the story of the Colombian army in 2010 sending a message to prisoners of a revolutionary guerilla group by hiding a Morse code message in a concocted pop song.</p>

<p>During a Colombian civil war, many civilians and soldiers had been abducted by a guerilla group FARC. Colombian Colonel Jose Espejo needed to get the message to a group of soldiers who were being held hostage deep in the jungle that they would be rescued soon. So he had his friend, advertising executive Juan Carlos Ortiz, produce a pop song with a secret coded message that help was coming.</p>
<p>They produced a song <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Better_Days_(Natalia_Gutierrez_y_Angelo_song)">"Mejores Dias"</a> (Better Days), by Natalia Gutierrez y Angelo, with a Morse code signal hidden within it: "19 people rescued. You're next. Don't lose hope."</p>
<p>Levine says:</p>
<blockquote> <p><em>The song was played on over 300 radio stations throughout rural Colombia and heard by over 3 million people. Even members of the FARC reportedly found it enjoyable, oblivious to its secret purpose. In 2012, the last prisoners of the FARC were freed, including one named Josue Alvarez, who testified that he had indeed heard the song, deciphered its message, and shared its meaning with his co-prisoners.</em></p> </blockquote>
