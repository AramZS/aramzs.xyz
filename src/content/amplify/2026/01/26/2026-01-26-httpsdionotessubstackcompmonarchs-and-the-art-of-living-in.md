title: Monarchs and the Art of Living in a Fascist Occupation
---


<p>For many days this month, amidst all the other things that there is to do under federal occupation and nearly constant ice raids, my dearest collaborators and I created these large Monarch butterflies and installed them on a frozen lake. There is too much to say right now about all the awful and beautiful and painful and inspiring things happening daily around us in the Twin Cities as we fight back against this ICE invasion, but I wanted to share this the writing that we did about these butterflies in the midst of it all.</p>

<p><em>Every year monarch butterflies journey from Canada and the United States to the mountains of Mexico and California. Despite efforts to militarize and violently control these relatively new borders between nation-states, monarchs drift silently and peacefully across them — defiant and beautifully free. We learn from the monarchs. Freedom of movement is how we navigate changing political and ecological climates.</em></p>
<p><em>Butterflies are more than just a symbol of migration —they represent our unavoidable collective dependence. Monarchs must move as a group, sharing the heat of their small bodies in order to survive the coldest nights. Just like the monarchs, our survival cannot be separated from our reliance on each other, and our entanglement is essential to our collective survival.</em></p>
<p><em>ICE was created to enforce arbitrary borders and violently remove those who the state has deemed disposable. We dream of a world free of these carceral systems, borders, and the empires that enforce them. Abolition is a proposal for ushering in this new world. It is our map, our hammer, and our paintbrush. We deserve a world that honors our entanglements rather than one that seeks to rid us of them — we will be unable to survive what is to come without them. “Abolish ICE” is a rallying cry for both a world free of this state-sanctioned violence, and the collective visioning of a meaningfully entangled world.</em></p>
<p><em>In the weeks since “Operation Metro Surge” sent thousands of ICE and border patrol agents to Minnesota, we have experienced overwhelming daily violence from the state. We have witnessed people abducted from bus stops on their way to work, stolen from their homes and torn from their children. We have washed pepper spray from the eyes of friends, and had our own eyes washed out by strangers. We watched an agent carelessly murder our neighbor, shooting her multiple times for peacefully protecting her neighbors. Another parent separated from their child, another spouse disappeared from their family for no reason. Amidst the tragedy of her death we have no choice but to continue to do exactly what Renée was doing that morning: compassionately reinforcing our lifelong commitment to one another, even in the face of increasing fascist violence.</em></p>
<p><em>We must remember, oppression rages hardest when it is most desperate. As Gramsci reminds us “the old world is dying, and the new world struggles to be born. Now is the time of monsters”.</em></p>
<p><em>The good news is that abolition is everywhere in these moments. Look around you! It lives in the art and the people who’ve chosen to come out on the coldest of days. It lives in every act that attempts to create beauty and care in times of unimaginable suffering. It occurs spontaneously, but with intention: in a trip to the grocery store for your neighbor too scared to leave their home, in caring for a child whose parents have been kidnapped by the state, in keeping lookout to make sure students can safely attend school, or in making a meal for loved ones assaulted by ICE, BPD, MPD or SPPD. The opportunity for care is endless in the face of so much dehumanizing cruelty. We invite you to reflect on what abolition means to you and ask that you make an act of care each day, during this occupation and beyond. Think of the butterflies, huddle close, and share your warmth. It is only together that we’ll make it through these coldest of winter nights.</em></p>

<p>If you’re looking for ways to support the resistance, here is my current list (although there are many more):</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://givebutter.com/spno">Support for Political art Making</a></strong>  through the <a href="https://spillpaint.org/">Spill Paint Not Oil</a> Art Studio that I organize at. We’ve been making so many banners, flags, patches, posters etc… — in particular large protest flags that have used up a lot of dollars worth of fabric. Money donated goes right towards art supplies.
