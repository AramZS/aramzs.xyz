<p><strong><em>European organizations are about to launch their own social media platform, W, amid rising tensions with the United States.</em></strong></p>
<p>The new platform, W, will require identification and photo validation to ensure that its users are both humans and who they claim to be, Danish news media outlet <em>Politiken.dk</em> reports.</p>
<p><a href="https://politiken.dk/nyhedsbreve/mine/nyhedsbrev_politiken_edition/art10698001/Danes-consumption-of-ADHD-medication-sets-new-record">The initiative to create the social media platform W</a> is supported by an advisory board and former ministers and business representatives, primarily from Sweden.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bilanz.ch/people/w-social-will-twitter-konkurrenz-machen-899933">Anna Zeiter, CEO of W</a>, has told <em>Bilanz.ch</em> that W stands for “We.” Meanwhile, the first of the Vs that make up W stands for “Values,” and the second for “Verified.”</p>
<p>“The fact that W comes before X in the alphabet is certainly also a welcome coincidence,” Zeiter said.</p>
<p>W’s data will be hosted decentrally in Europe by European companies, and the platform will adhere to strict EU data protection laws.</p>
<p>“If political Brussels starts posting on W instead of X, we'll have already achieved a great deal,” she added in the interview for <em>Bilanz.ch</em>.</p>
<p>In her LinkedIn post announcing the launch of W, Zeiter emphasized that systemic disinformation is eroding public trust and weakening democratic decision-making.</p>

<p>“We believe there is an urgent need for a new social media platform built, governed and hosted in Europe. With human verification, free speech and data privacy at its core,” she wrote.</p>
<p>However, <a data-link-style-setting="default" href="https://cybernews.com/tech/social-platform-w-users/">previous user exodus from X to platforms like Mastodon and Bluesky</a> had limited success, as some users lost their well-established network.</p>
<h2>Who is Anna Zeiter, the CEO of W?</h2>
<p>Zeiter is a Swiss privacy expert with a long history of working in tech. According to her LinkedIn profile, she spent over a decade at eBay, an American e-commerce company, where she oversaw data protection and artificial intelligence (AI).</p>
<p>She earned her PhD in law at the University of Hamburg and later studied at Stanford University.</p>
<p>W will be legally the subsidiary of “We Don’t Have Time,” a media platform for climate action, but the team is scattered across Europe, with offices in Berlin and Paris planned, Bilanz reports.</p>
<p><em>Washington Post</em> reporter Ishaan Tharoor has shared a snapshot of the W’s introductory video, displayed at the debut event at the World Economic Forum in Davos.</p>
<p>The announcement comes amid heightened tensions between the US and European countries.</p>
<p>President Donald Trump has just announced a fresh round of tariffs on several European nations for resisting his plans to buy or annex Greenland by military force. Greenland is part of the Kingdom of Denmark.</p>
<p>US social media companies have long accused European regulators of unfairly targeting them and imposing censorship.</p>
<p>The European Union, which has some of the most stringent regulations in the world, says it aims to protect users and increase the accountability of the platforms.</p>
<p>​Elon Musk’s X is at the center of a standoff between big tech and Brussels. <a href="https://cybernews.com/tech/musk-european-union-fine/">After the platform was fined €120M ($140M)</a> for breaching transparency rules under the European Digital Services Act, Musk called for the bloc’s abolition.</p>
<h2>X is no longer a public square</h2>
<p>A group of 54 members of the European Parliament called for European alternatives to the dominant social media platforms on Monday.</p>
<p>They argued that “X is no longer an open and balanced tool for political communication or journalism” after the company was bought by Musk.</p>

<p>“It is not a ‘public square’ – it now resembles a deepfake pornography website, and a one-way broadcast system for Musk himself,” they wrote in <a data-link-style-setting="default" href="https://extranet.greens-efa-service.eu/public/media/file/1/9172">an open letter to President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen</a>.</p>
<p>X has drawn wide condemnation in recent weeks as the social platform was flooded with images of digitally undressed women and children generated by its chatbot Grok.</p>
<p>W is the European social media platform marketed as an alternative to X, a social network owned by Elon Musk. It will focus on fighting misinformation and will require user identity verification to prevent bots.</p>
<h3> Is the W social platform already available to users? </h3>
<p>The W social platform is not yet widely available to users. The platform was introduced on January 20th at the debut event at the World Economic Forum in Davos.</p>
<h3> Who is behind the W social platform? </h3>
<p>Anna Zeiter, a Swiss privacy expert with a long history of working in tech, is the CEO of the platform, which is legally a subsidiary of the “We Don’t Have Time” media platform.</p>
