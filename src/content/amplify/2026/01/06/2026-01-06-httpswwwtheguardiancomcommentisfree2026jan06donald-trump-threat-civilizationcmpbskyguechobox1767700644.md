<h2 data-gu-name="standfirst">The moral purpose of civilized society is to prevent the stronger from attacking the weaker. The US was founded on that principle</h2>
<p>Trump’s domestic and foreign policies – ranging from his attempted coup against the United States five years ago, to his incursion into <a data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/venezuela">Venezuela</a> last weekend, to his current threats against Cuba, Colombia, and Greenland – undermine domestic and international law. But that’s not all.</p>
<p>They threaten what we mean by civilization.</p>
<p>The moral purpose of civilized society is to prevent the stronger from attacking and exploiting the weaker. Otherwise, we’d be permanently immersed in a brutish war in which only the fittest and most powerful could survive.</p>
<p>This principle lies at the center of America’s founding documents – the Declaration of Independence, the constitution and the Bill of Rights. It’s also the core of the postwar international order championed by the United States, including the UN charter – emphasizing multilateralism, democracy, human rights, and the rule of law.</p>
<p>But it’s a fragile principle, easily violated by those who would exploit their power. Maintaining the principle requires that the powerful have enough integrity to abstain from seeking short-term wins, and that the rest of us hold them accountable if they don’t.</p>
<p>Every time people or corporations or countries that are richer and more powerful attack and exploit those that are not, the fabric of civilization frays. If such aggression is not contained, the fabric unravels. If not stopped, the world can descend into chaos and war. It has happened before.</p>
<p>We now inhabit a society and world grown vastly more unequal. Political and economic power are more concentrated than ever before. This invites the powerful to exploit the weaker because the powerful feel omnipotent.</p>
<p>The wealth of Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, Larry Ellison, Charles Koch, and a handful of others is almost beyond comprehension. The influence of big tech, big oil, and the largest aerospace and defense corporations extends over much of the globe. AI is likely to centralize wealth and power even more. The destructive power of the United States, China, and Russia is unmatched in human history.</p>
<p>Trump – enabled by cowardly congressional Republicans and a pliant majority on the supreme court – has turned the US presidency into the most powerful and unaccountable agent of American government in history.</p>
<p>Put it all together and you see the threat.</p>
<p>A direct line connects Trump’s attempted coup five years ago to his capture of Nicolás Maduro last weekend. Both were lawless. Both were premised on the hubris of omnipotence.</p>
<p>That same line connects to Trump’s current threats against Cuba, Colombia, and Greenland.</p>
<p>You see much the same in Putin’s war on Ukraine. In Xi’s threats against Taiwan. In global depredation and monopolization by big tech and big oil. In Russian, Chinese, and American oligarchs who have fused public power with their personal wealth.</p>
<p>But unfettered might does not make right. It makes for instability, upheaval, and war.</p>
<p>History shows that laws and norms designed to constrain the powerful also protect them. Without such constraints, their insatiable demands for more power and wealth eventually bring them down – along with their corporations, nations, or empires. And threaten world war.</p>
<p>Trump’s blatant lawlessness will haunt America and the world – and civilization – for years to come.</p>
