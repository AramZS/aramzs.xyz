title: Learn to Type Faster
---
<h1>Learn to Type Faster</h1>
<p>This web application will help you to learn <em>touch typing</em> which means typing through muscle memory without using your eyesight to find the keys. It can improve your typing speed and accuracy dramatically. The opposite is <em>hunt and peck typing</em>, a method of typing in which you look at the keyboard instead of the screen, and use only the index fingers.</p>
<p>This is a short tutorial that will explain how this application works.</p>
<p>You can use the left and right arrow keys to navigate through these slides.</p>
