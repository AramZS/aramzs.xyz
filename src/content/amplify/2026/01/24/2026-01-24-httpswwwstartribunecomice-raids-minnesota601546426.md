<p>As the Department of Homeland Security undertakes stepped-up immigration enforcement in Minnesota, arrests and other confrontations have been popping up in more locations.</p>

<p>The Department of Homeland Security’s Minnesota-focused enforcement campaign has been underway for several weeks, and the agency says it’s resulted in more than 400 arrests so far.</p>
<p>The Minnesota effort, “Operation Metro Surge,” has seen Immigration, Customs and Enforcement (ICE) agents stepping up their presence in Minneapolis and St. Paul, and in recent days also in several nearby suburbs.</p>
<p>Minnesota is just the latest state to be targeted for such an effort by the administration of President Donald Trump, who in recent comments has repeatedly criticized the state’s large Somali population. DHS has at times singled out Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey by name for their immigration policies.</p>
<p>Protest groups have been tracking enforcement activity and at times have clashed with agents as well as protested outside hotels where they are staying.</p>
<p>The Minnesota Star Tribune is following reports of individual incidents as we learn of them as well as attempting to provide broader context and stories around the enforcement effort. Tips can be e-mailed to whistleblower@startribune.com.</p>
