<p>WASHINGTON (TNND) — Arizona Democratic Attorney General Kris Mayes said during an interview that residents could fire upon <a href="https://thenationaldesk.com/news/americas-news-now/ice-arrests-hundreds-amid-claims-of-engineered-immigration-crisis-trump-administration-minnesota-peter-schweizer-united-states-drug-trafficking-homeland-security-china-muslim-brotherhood-mexico-american-people-bill-clinton-barack-obama-joe-biden">ICE </a>agents who are masked if they feel they are in danger due to the state’s laws on self-defense.</p>
<p>Mayes explained that Arizona has a “Stand Your Ground” law that allows people to use lethal force if they believe their life is in danger.</p>
<h2><em>“It’s kind of a recipe for disaster because you have these masked federal officers with very little identification, sometimes no identification, wearing plain clothes and masks,” Mayes said <a href="https://www.12news.com/video/news/local/12news-exclusive-az-ag-kris-mayes-one-on-one-with-brahm-resnik/75-69f12656-07c4-472e-a9f6-c00410782b27">during an interview with 12News</a>.</em></h2>
<p>She said that the “Stand Your Ground” law in Arizona allows residents to use lethal force if they feel like their life is in jeopardy.</p>
<h2><em>“And we have a Stand Your Ground law that says that if you reasonably believe that your life is in danger and you’re in your house or your car or on your property, that you can defend yourself with lethal force,” Mayes said.</em></h2>
<h2>The interviewer, Brahm Resnik pushed back on Mayes, asking if this gave people permission to shoot federal agents.</h2>
<p>Mayes said that the law was a fact and she wasn’t encouraging violence.</p>
<h2><em>“If you’re being attacked by someone who is not identified as a peace officer — how do you know?” Mayes said.</em></h2>
<p>She also said real cops don’t wear masks.</p>
