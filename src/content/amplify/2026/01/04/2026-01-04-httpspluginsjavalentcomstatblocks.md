<p>To gain the best experience of Fantasy Statblocks, you will need the following additional Community Plugins.</p>
<p><a data-tooltip-position="top" href="https://github.com/valentine195/obsidian-dice-roller">Dice Roller</a>:<br/>
 A plugin which adds the ability to render complicated dice functions within Obsidian. Within the Fantasy Statblocks, certain damage, healing, and modifiers become clickable dice.</p>
<p><a data-tooltip-position="top" href="https://github.com/valentine195/obsidian-initiative-tracker">Initiative Tracker</a>:<br/>

<h2 data-heading="Beginning with statblocks">Beginning with statblocks </h2>
<p>The majority of your interactions with Fantasy Statblocks will start and end with this piece of code block language.</p>
<pre><code data-line="0">```statblock
creature:
```
</code></pre>
<p>The programming code syntax used within Statblocks is YAML. YAML is defined as "human-friendly data serialization language for all programming languages" by <a data-tooltip-position="top" href="https://yaml.org">yaml.org</a>, and it is a very powerful syntax used in multiple areas of Obsidian.</p>
<p>However, it's syntax is very strict, and you will need to pay attention to the spacing, the indentation, the quotations, and the colons in this section carefully, or you may receive errors.</p>
<p>The good news is that because it is designed to be human-readable, the errors are easy to catch by a fellow human, or even a helpful <a data-tooltip-position="top" href="https://www.yamllint.com">YAML Linter</a>.</p>
<p>Without further ado, let's get exploring Statblocks.</p>
