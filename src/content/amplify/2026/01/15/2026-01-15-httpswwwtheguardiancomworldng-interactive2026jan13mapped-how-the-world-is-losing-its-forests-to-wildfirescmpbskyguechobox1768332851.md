<p>The world is losing forests to fire at an unsustainable rate, experts have warned.</p>
<p>Wildfires have always been part of nature’s cycle, but in recent decades their scale, frequency and intensity in carbon-rich forests have surged.</p>
<p>Research from the <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.wri.org/insights/global-trends-forest-fires">World Resources Institute (WRI)</a> shows that fires now destroy more than twice as much tree cover as they did two decades ago.</p>
<p>In 2024 alone, 135,000km² of forest burned – the most extreme <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/aug/13/how-dangerous-wildfires-stop-them-getting-worse">wildfire</a> year on record.</p>
<p>Yet fires in other landscapes have not risen in the same way, according to <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-024-02452-2">research</a> from the University of Tasmania. While the total area burned globally has <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aal4108">fallen</a> for decades as farms have expanded across Africa and slowed the spread of blazes – forests have become a new hotspot.</p>
<p>The rise in forest fires is unmistakable. Four of the five worst years on record have occurred since 2020.</p>
<p>Research from the <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.wri.org/insights/global-trends-forest-fires">WRI</a> shows that 2024 was the first time that major fires raged across tropical, hot and humid forests such as the Amazon, and boreal forests, such as those spanning Canada’s vast coniferous regions.</p>

<h2><strong>Some of the world’s worst-affected areas</strong></h2>
<p>Brazil, Bolivia, Russia, Australia and Canada have all endured some of their worst fire seasons in recent years, as heatwaves stoked by fossil fuel pollution drive the risk of extreme blazes higher.</p>
<p>The maps, using data from the <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://glad.umd.edu/dataset/Fire_GFL/">University of Maryland</a>, show some of the hardest-hit forests.</p>

Millions of hectares of land burned nationwide. While the worst effects of the 2019-20 bushfires on property were in the eastern states, forestry suffered more in western Australia.</p><p>Several contributing factors have been <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2020EF001671">identified</a> as to why these forests were affected so severely: ongoing drought, high winds, heatwaves and changing land use practices. More than 3,000 homes were destroyed and over 30 people died during this fire season. An estimated three billion <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/apr/01/alexis-wright-black-summer-bushfires-vigil-sydney-speech-3-billion-animals-killed-are-our-relatives-they-deserve-to-be-mourned">animals</a> also perished as crucial ecosystems such as the Stirling Range national park burned.</p></figure></figure>
<h2><strong>How climate change is driving this change</strong></h2>
<p>Experts warn that climate change is making wildfires bigger, longer and more destructive. Hotter, drier conditions are extending fire seasons and fuelling more extreme blazes.</p>
<p>2023 and 2024 had the most forest area burned by wildfires on record. They were also the two hottest years on record.</p>
<figure data-alt="Chart showing how both temperatures and burned forests have increased since 2000" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-testid="interactive-element-Chart%20showing%20how%20both%20temperatures%20and%20burned%20forests%20have%20increased%20since%202000"></figure>
<p>Northern latitudes are heating faster than the global average, driving a surge in boreal forest fires.</p>
<p>James MacCarthy, wildfire research manager with the Global Forest Watch initiative at the WRI, said: “Because of where they grow and how climate patterns are changing, boreal and temperate conifer forests are warming and drying faster than most other forests.</p>
<p>“Fire is a natural part of these ecosystems, but the traits that once helped them survive infrequent burns – like thick bark and seeds that are released in response to fire – are now being overwhelmed as fires grow larger, more frequent and more severe.”</p>
<p>“Fires are increasingly burning in places that were historically too wet to ignite and rarely caught fire, like peat-rich forests.”</p>
<h2><strong>A vicious cycle</strong></h2>
<p>What makes burning forests even more concerning is the fact that, normally, they are <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/oct/14/nature-carbon-sink-collapse-global-heating-models-emissions-targets-evidence-aoe">carbon sinks</a>.</p>
<p>By absorbing CO<sub>2</sub> and storing it in trees, plants and soil, forests normally regulate the climate by reducing greenhouse gases and slowing the pace of global warming.</p>
<p>But when they burn down, the carbon that they have stored is released into the atmosphere.</p>
<p>In 2023 and 2024, forests <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.wri.org/insights/forest-carbon-sink-shrinking-fires-deforestation">only absorbed a quarter</a> of the CO<sub>2</sub> they do in a typical year.</p>
<p>MacCarthy warned: “When these forests and peatlands burn, they release carbon that has been locked away in trees and soil for hundreds of years, accelerating climate change and setting the stage for more fire. <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/oct/22/smoke-pollution-from-wildfires-may-be-killing-an-extra-12000-people-a-year-new-research-suggests">Smoke from these fires</a> can travel thousands of miles, polluting the air for millions of people, while nearby communities face evacuations, health risks and mounting costs.”</p>
<p>Calum Cunningham, research fellow at the University of Tasmania fire centre, said: “Massive forest fire seasons threaten to reshape the atmosphere by releasing huge amounts of CO<sub>2</sub>, which could create a feedback loop – more warming, worse fire weather, more fire. That’s the ultimate fear.”</p>
<h2><strong>Curbing the damage</strong></h2>
<p>Reducing human-caused carbon emissions and addressing climate change is the crucial step in tackling fires.</p>
<p>But experts say local action is also essential. Halting deforestation, restoring degraded land and managing fire risk in vulnerable regions can all help curb the damage.</p>
<figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.InteractiveAtomBlockElement"><figure data-atom-id="interactives/2017/12/blank-div-5" data-atom-type="interactive-layout"><h2>Bolivia</h2><p> </p><img alt="Bolivia map" src="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/atoms/2025/08/interactive-forest-fires/assets/v/1768301292733/svg/bolivia.png"/><p> </p><p>2001-2024</p><p> </p><p>31,328 km2 were burned in Bolivia. That’s about the size of Belgium</p><p> </p><p><a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/sep/14/forests-disease-wildfires-deforestation-amazonian-rainforest">Bolivia’s</a> 2024 fires were its worst on record. More than 10,000 km² of forest burned – double the previous high. Experts warn that worsening drought and the rapid spread of agriculture are fuelling a surge in fire activity across the country.</p></figure></figure>
<p>But some forests in Bolivia escaped the worst of the flames.</p>
<p>Charagua Iyambae, a newly established Indigenous Territory in southern Bolivia, had invested in early warning systems and land-use policies that helped <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/may/23/global-forest-loss-record-high-latin-america-heart-inferno">prevent the spread</a> of forest fires.</p>
<p>A crucial protected area within the territory – called Ñembi Guasu – largely avoided the worst of the fires due to a combination of Indigenous-led governance and practical fire-management. It is a 12,000 km<sup>2</sup> area and home to jaguars, giant armadillos and tapirs.</p>
<p>This involved local Guaraní park rangers using satellite monitoring to report risks quickly to authorities, enabling quick action before small ignitions spread. Pre-positioned people and gear were quick to stamp out or block fires before they became bigger problems.</p>
<p>All of this meant that, while the map above shows how swathes of Bolivian forests burned last year, Charagua Iyambae was left relatively untouched – even areas that burned before.</p>
<p>But authorities cannot be complacent. In early September this year, the territory declared a disaster as flames entered the protected area. Rainfall eventually helped extinguish them, but the episode showed there is no such thing as fire immunity.</p>
<p>Some fire-affected forests can regrow if given the chance: in Australia, for example, many ecosystems are adapted to recover after low-intensity burns, though recovery depends on the species lost and the extent to which the land is left ecologically degraded.</p>
<p>Experts warn that these trends will continue as climate change gets worse. The ongoing rise in global temperatures is expected to create even more conducive conditions for wildfires, leading to longer and more intense fire seasons.</p>
<p>Boreal and temperate conifer forests, already experiencing rapid warming, are especially vulnerable. Without significant action, the vicious cycle of warming leading to more fires, less carbon absorption and further warming is set to accelerate.</p>
<p>The WRI’s MacCarthy said that a combination of local and global solutions will be needed to solve the crisis.</p>
<p>“To reduce the growing risk of forest fires, we need to address the underlying drivers. Cutting greenhouse gas emissions can limit the hot, dry conditions that fuel fires, while ending deforestation can slow climate change and prevent forest fires linked to land clearing.”</p>
