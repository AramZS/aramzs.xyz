title: How to Be Accepted Where You Don't Belong
---
<p>The title reflects my signature move. It's pretty much all I've ever done, from my youth hanging out in ghetto jazz bars to a music career as the only white guy in the jazz or latin bands, to my chowhounding in restaurants of every stripe, earning respect and friendship from waiters who normally roll their eyes when people who look like me walk in. In fact, this is a primary chowhounding skill: finding acceptance where one doesn't belong.</p>
<p>There's a trick for it (which, like all my tricks, is crazy-easy though super-counterintuitive). Let's use "an American in Portugal" as an example, since that's my current circumstance. There's a convivial place where everybody's a regular. Their sandwiches (with meat grilled on a tiny hibachi just outside) are great, but outsider might wonder how to gain entrée, given that the joint falls silent when they set foot inside.</p>
<p>In this scenario, 99% of people go one of two ways. They:</p>
<blockquote> 1. Stay the hell away, or<br/><br/> 2. Strive to conquer </blockquote>
<p>#1 is the way to protect one's comfort zone. No gain, no pain.</p>
<p>#2, where one blusters in with one's big personality and tries to <b><i>make friends</i></b>, is one of those propositions we might envision in our cartoonish imagination but which fizzles in reality. To be sure, there are rare people who can actually do this, but I'm not certain they're the healthiest people, or that they can stand the test of time if this is more than a one-off.</p>
<p>The first thing you need to recognize is that you don't need to prove yourself. None of those regulars became regulars out of worthiness. That guy telling stories while the rest laugh uproariously didn't get this gig because he's the funniest guy who auditioned. They all just settled into roles. No one earned any of this. They became regulars by being regulars. So that's the route you'll take.</p>
<p>Venture in, calm and kind and polite, with no entitlement or pressure. Peaceful and relaxed and not drawing attention to yourself. Be a happy, satisfied odd duck. Enjoy being among the disdainful skeptics, as a minor color in their larger painting (a fine example of the "turn-the-cheek" move which has been largely misinterpreted).</p>
<p>You're an odd duck, but you're not compelled to act like it. Embrace your outsiderness, but be a comfortable, pleasant, happy outsider. Comfortableness is a framing choice, irrespective of external circumstance. So choose comfort. With that tiny shift of framing, you have completely changed the reality, like magic. You're now a disamingly comfortable odd duck.</p>
<p>Now <b><i>keep coming back</i></b>, continuing to be pleasant and low-maintenance. Don't seek engagement. Don't assert your big personality or vie for attention. Don't try to join the reindeer games. Your very familiarity already makes you a part of those games, though it's not consciously noticed. You are slowly becoming wallpaper, morbid though that might sound. Don't hear seconds or minutes or hours ticking. Think in weeks and months and seasons, as you glacially absorb into the decor.</p>
<p>Soon, you will become <b><i>the</i></b> odd duck, rather than merely <b><i>an</i></b> odd duck, though this transition will be invisible for you and them both. And, one day after that, someone who doesn't belong will venture in, and your antenna will prick up along with the crowd's. This person will strike you as an odd duck. And you'll realize with astonishment that you've become an insider. Even if these people are not your best buddies, and don't slap your back when you enter. You're now <b><i>our</i></b> odd duck.</p>
<p>Don't solve for the wrong problem. You don't need to cop the culture or painstakingly "fit in". Remain the odd duck you patently are. Just become, via sheer passage of time, "our" odd duck by showing up. A lot (see <a href="https://jimleff.blogspot.com/2024/10/win-by-not-quitting.html">"Win By Not Quitting"</a>), letting the engrained human faculty of familiarity work its magic over time.</p>
<p>You may not have stoked what feels like real warmth and active belonging. It may remain a more passive belonging. But passive belonging can be better. Active belonging has requirements, not all of them immediately apparent or appealing. And active belonging brings responsibilities which might not be entirely agreeable. Passive belonging is just fine. You may be a non-belonger, but you're <b><i>"our"</i></b> non-belonger. The non-belonger who belongs!</p>
<p>I can assure you that there are very few places in the world where an odd duck can't achieve passive belonging by simply showing up. Regulars, it turns out, become regulars entirely by regularity.</p>
<p><i>I <a href="https://jimleff.blogspot.com/2024/11/roy-haynes-meets-mr-raucous.html">played greasy trombone</a> in a few crack houses at the height of the 1980s epidemic. I didn't need these measures, because musicians get a pass. They inherently belong. It's one of the things I liked best about being a musician.<br/>
<br/>
 But I became familiar enough with the social fabric in such places to assure you that a newcomer, from a completely different context, and even one who never consumed the, er, product, could have come to belong in such a place, just by sitting quietly and calmly nursing a beer night after night. It's just matter of time of picking up momentum as "the white guy who comes in for a beer", spoken with very mild affection. It's that easy, if you don't make it needlessly difficult.<br/>
<br/>
 I can't overstate how well this works even at extremes. A guy in a yarmulka, following these instructions, could, if he were perverse enough to want to, make friends among white supremecists (without debasing himself via ingratiation). The vast majority of biases—even hatreds—are conceptual, not personal. That's not to say you'll be well-received at first. But when a racist insists "Some of my best friends are..." that's not just a risible trope. It's often true. And me, I like being that best friend, because I'm the rare bird (odd duck?) who can <a href="https://jimleff.blogspot.com/2025/06/acceptance-is-not-approval.html">accept without approving</a>. </i></p>
