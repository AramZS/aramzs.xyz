<p></p>
<p>The first patient to receive a breakthrough treatment on the NHS for his aggressive form of leukaemia has said it was "fantastic" and "very sci-fi".</p>
<p>Oscar Murphy, 28 was given the "living drug", called CAR-T therapy, for his blood cancer, at Manchester Royal Infirmary.</p>
<p>BBC News was present on 2 January when Oscar received the first of two infusions of his own immune cells, which had been genetically modified to recognise and target his cancer.</p>
<p>NHS England has agreed to fund the immunotherapy at several centres across the country. About 50 NHS patients a year are likely to benefit from it.</p>
<p>Oscar was diagnosed with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (B-cell ALL) in March 2025.</p>
<p>He underwent chemotherapy and a donor stem cell transplant in July but in November was told that his cancer had returned.</p>
<p>"The leukaemia I've got is so fast-acting," the car salesman from Bury said. "It needs an even quicker response to stop it. And we've now got an answer for that."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa2406526?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed">In a clinical trial, 77% of patients went into remission</a> after treatment, with half showing no signs of cancer after three and a half years.</p>
<p>On average, the treatment gave patients 15.6 additional months of life.</p>
<p>Oscar's haematologist, Dr Eleni Tholouli, said the CAR-T therapy was safer than existing treatments, with fewer side-effects and much more effective.</p>
<p>"Usually, this type of leukaemia is very aggressive and adult patients don't live beyond six to eight months. With this therapy, we are able to offer them years and potentially a cure.</p>
<p>"It's very significant and is revolutionising the way we tackle this cancer."</p>

<p>CAR-T therapy has been available on the NHS for several years for certain types of leukaemia and lymphoma but has only now been extended to adults with B-cell ALL, with this new form of the treatment.</p>
<p>Last month, Oscar had T-cells - a type of white blood cell - removed and sent to a lab in Stevenage.</p>
<p>The cells were then reprogrammed using a harmless virus to introduce a genetic sequence that enables them to identify the cancer.</p>
<p>New surface receptors can then recognise and are able to attach to cancer cells - like a lock and key - and mark them for destruction.</p>
<p>They become "chimeric antigen receptor T-cells" - or CAR T-cells - and their numbers are greatly expanded in the lab to make millions of copies.</p>
<p>Oscar's personalised treatment, or living drug, was cryopreserved and sent to Manchester Royal Infirmary.</p>
<p>The tiny bag containing Oscar's personalised treatment held 100 million CAR T-cells in just three teaspoons of liquid, and it took only a few minutes to infuse into his bloodstream.</p>

<p>Oscar said he was surprised the treatment could pack such a powerful punch in such a small dose.</p>
<p>"It's very sci-fi, but if it means it gets rid of the cancer permanently and my own cells can do it it's just fantastic."</p>
<p>Oscar had a second infusion of 300 million cells yesterday, marking the end of his CAR-T treatment.</p>
<p>As this is a "living drug", the cancer-killing T-cells stay in the body for a long time and will continue to grow and work inside the patient after the final infusion.</p>
<p>The CAR-T therapy is manufactured by Autolus, a spin-out company from University College London.</p>
<p>During clinical trials, the patient's cells had to be sent to laboratories in the US.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ta1116/resources/obecabtagene-autoleucel-for-treating-relapsed-or-refractory-bcell-precursor-acute-lymphoblastic-leukaemia-pdf-2973530453903557">The list price of the treatment is £372,000 per infusion</a>, but the NHS has a confidential discount.</p>
<p>It will be available to patients over the age of 26 whose B-cell ALL has not responded to treatment or has returned at several centres in England, including Cambridge, Newcastle, Sheffield, Plymouth and London.</p>
<p>Patients from Wales and Northern Ireland will need to travel to England for treatment. It has not yet been approved in Scotland.</p>
<p>NHS England estimates that around 50 patients a year may benefit, but Tholouli told the BBC she believed it could be more, and predicted it would eventually be used as a first-line treatment instead of stem cell transplantation.</p>
<p>Prof Peter Johnson, NHS National Clinical Director for Cancer, said it was a "landmark moment" for people with aggressive blood cancer.</p>
<p>He added it was "remarkable" the treatment now delivered at NHS centres had been developed from scientific research within the UK.</p>
<p>"It will help more people like Oscar live longer and healthier lives."</p>

<p>Chris Williams, 29, from Belfast was diagnosed with the same aggressive type of leukaemia as Oscar in 2021.</p>
<p>When the cancer returned, he was given the CAR-T therapy in Manchester when it was still an experimental treatment. He has now been in remission for nearly three years.</p>
<p>"A few years ago I was very unwell and now I'm able to live a full life. I was able to go back to work. I also met Chloe and now we're engaged.</p>
<p>"I have fantastic support from my family and they are over the moon."</p>
<p>Oscar and his fiance Lauren were married at Manchester Royal Infirmary last month.</p>
<p>He told the BBC he wanted to "get it done" because of the uncertainties surrounding his condition, but the couple have another ceremony booked for October.</p>
<p>"I want children and the white picket fence with my amazing wife - I just want that normality. This is my gateway to doing it and I can't wait."</p>
<p><i>Clarification 14 January: This article was amended to make clear from the beginning that Oscar Murphy is the first adult patient with a particular type of leukaemia, B-cell ALL, rather than leukaemia more broadly, to receive this form of CAR-T therapy on the NHS.</i></p>
