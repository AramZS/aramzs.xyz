<p>California Attorney General Rob Bonta is investigating Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence company xAI over the proliferation of nonconsensual, sexualized images, the state Department of Justice announced Wednesday. The move comes amid growing outrage over AI-edited images of women and girls generated by the company’s chatbot Grok.</p>
<p>“The avalanche of reports detailing the non-consensual sexually explicit material that xAI has produced and posted online in recent weeks is shocking,” Bonta said in a statement. “I urge xAI to take immediate action to ensure this goes no further. We have zero tolerance for the AI-based creation and dissemination of nonconsensual intimate images or of child sexual abuse material.”</p>
<p>Gov. Gavin Newsom threw his support behind Bonta’s investigation into the tech giant, posting on Musk’s social media company X that “xAI’s decision to create and host a breeding ground for predators to spread nonconsensual sexually explicit AI deepfakes, including images that digitally undress children, is vile. I am calling on the Attorney General to immediately investigate the company.”</p>
