<p>Indiana University in Indianapolis canceled a dinner in honor of Martin Luther King Jr. hosted annually in January by the Black Student Union, <a href="https://mirrorindy.org/martin-luther-king-mlk-dinner-black-student-union-iu-indianapolis/?utm_campaign=Daily%20Newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--EyLVcOMrSdM4d4cj9rbiwf5iu_71tpgX9e9BOv4benNh_BVLCLUHU7zzLfQYxCpfle__lIg7bOO3gMcr3QEGbuo3FOUsLzrVb2MUjLQV-GRniuqk&amp;_hsmi=398484027&amp;utm_content=398484027&amp;utm_source=hs_email"><em>Mirror Indy</em> reported</a>. This year’s would have been the 57th consecutive annual MLK dinner, which was first convened in 1969.</p>
<p>Officials in the Division of Student Affairs told the Black Student Union the event was canceled at the end of the fall semester, citing “budget constraints,” according to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DTOuqU_mFl5/?img_index=2">a letter the Black Student Union executive council</a> posted on Instagram.</p>
<p>“For months prior, we had been diligently seeking guidance and confirmation on whether the dinner would be approved, funded and supported,” the executive council wrote. “This is not just about a dinner. This is about the erosion of Black traditions under vague justifications. This is about institutional decisions being made without Black voices at the table.”</p>
<p>In <a href="https://indianapolis.iu.edu/about/leadership/updates/26-01-13-honoring-dr-martin-luther-king-jr.html?_gl=1*oxxnrg*_gcl_au*MTE5Mjk4NTk4OC4xNzYzNDA5MjI5*_ga*MTI4MjI0MTkzMC4xNzYzMzE5OTA3*_ga_61CH0D2DQW*czE3Njg0MjE1MTYkbzI2JGcxJHQxNzY4NDIyMTQxJGo1OCRsMCRoMA..">a letter to campus</a> Tuesday, IU Indianapolis chancellor Latha Ramchand said, “The MLK Dinner is not going away—rather we are in a moment of transition,” and described a new task force that will “help us reimagine our affinity dinners and related events.” The task force will complete its work by April 10, she said.</p>
<p>In their response letter to the Division of Student Affairs, the Black Student Union’s executive council questioned whether the current political climate may have influenced administrators’ decision to cancel the dinner. The university in May closed its <a href="https://mirrorindy.org/indiana-university-indianapolis-dei-office-trump-administration-diversity/">diversity, equity and inclusion office</a>, which included the Multicultural Center and the LGBTQ+ Center; student organizations within the office were transferred to the Office of Student Involvement. A student with the Queer Student Union told <em>Mirror Indy</em> that the Harvey Milk Dinner, typically held in October, was also canceled this academic year.</p>
