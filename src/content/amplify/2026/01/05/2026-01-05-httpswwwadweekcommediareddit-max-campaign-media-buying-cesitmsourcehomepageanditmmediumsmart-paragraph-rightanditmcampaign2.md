<p>Reddit is rolling out its own AI-powered media-buying tool aimed at wooing performance advertisers—and tackling transparency complaints that have plagued similar tools from competitors.</p>
<p>Unveiled at the CES technology conference in Las Vegas on Monday, Max Campaign automates targeting, bidding, and creative optimization for advertisers on Reddit Ads Manager. The tool is designed to simplify campaign setup while leaning on what Reddit calls its key differentiator: a trove of user-generated conversations, or “Reddit community intelligence.”</p>
<p>Jyoti Vaidee, Reddit’s vice president of ads product, told ADWEEk that the company built Max Campaign to capitalize on growing performance ad momentum, where brands are increasingly turning to Reddit to reach audiences they don’t find elsewhere and to influence how their products appear across AI chatbots like ChatGPT, as <a href="https://www.adweek.com/media/reddit-advertisers-ai-search-visibility-deck/">ADWEEK previously reported</a>.</p>

<p>“When [brands] lean into Reddit, both on the organic and the paid side, that sparks more conversation, and then that data powers the LLM outputs,” Vaidee said. “That’s why we are building tools to make it easier for [brands] to lean into Reddit.”</p>
<p>The goal, she added, is to combine automation with clearer insight into audience behavior and creative performance—rather than simply offering another “set it and forget it” product. Max Campaign is powered by external AI providers. Vaidee declined to share specifics.</p>
<p>Max Campaign marks Reddit’s most direct push to compete with giants like Google and Meta for performance ad dollars, bringing automation deeper into its ad stack. It also comes at the heels of Reddit emerging as a reference point for brands looking to influence how they surface in AI-powered chatbots, as the <a href="https://www.adweek.com/social-marketing/ai-licensing-deals-with-google-and-openai-make-up-10-of-reddits-revenue/">platform signs deals</a> with Google and OpenAI to inform their answer engines.</p>
<p>Reddit’s revenue from advertising grew 74% year-over-year in the third quarter of 2025, to $549 million, according to the <a href="https://s203.q4cdn.com/380862485/files/doc_financials/2025/q3/Q3-25-Shareholder-Letter.pdf">company’s financial results</a>. In the same period, conversions more than doubled, and daily active users rose 19% year-over-year.</p>

<p>More than 600 brands participated in a six-month alpha test of Max Campaign in 2025, including Brooks Running and Cozey.</p>
<p>In a campaign promoting its Ghost 17 running shoe, Brooks reported a 37% decrease in cost per click and 27% more clicks over 21 days—without making any manual changes. Split tests comparing Max Campaign to business-as-usual campaigns among early testers showed 17% lower cost per acquisition and 27% more conversions on average, Reddit said in a statement.</p>
<p>Max Campaign is available now to select advertisers, the company said, with plans to roll out to all advertisers later this year.</p>
<h4><strong>A more transparent ad tool </strong></h4>
<p>Reddit is pitching Max Campaign as more transparent than other automated tools. While the AI automates campaign decisions—like targeting and bidding—the platform offers an “open box” approach, Vaidee said. The Audience Insights view, for example, shows where an ad resonated on Reddit, even if the communities, personas, or conversation themes weren’t initially targeted.</p>
<p>Vaidee noted that these insights are designed to extend beyond campaign optimization. Advertisers can use them to inform broader marketing strategies or product decisions based on how Reddit users are already talking about categories and brands.</p>
<p>The tool also gives advertisers some control over the AI, including target audience selection and brand safety settings, such as excluding ads from running against specific communities or keywords.</p>
<p>Max Campaign offers asset-level reporting, allowing advertisers to see how individual creative elements, like images or headlines, perform. That level of granularity has become a flashpoint elsewhere, where automated tools have drawn criticism for limiting visibility into how ad dollars are spent.</p>
<p>Vaidee acknowledged that advertiser skepticism around AI-driven buying tools was top of mind during development, particularly as platforms ask brands to hand over more control to algorithms.</p>
<p>“It’s about really learning from previous products that hit the market earlier—and a big part of that is building trust and transparency with advertisers,” Vaidee said.</p>
