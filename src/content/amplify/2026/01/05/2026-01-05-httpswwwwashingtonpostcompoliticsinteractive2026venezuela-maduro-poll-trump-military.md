<p>We texted 1,000 Americans about</p>
<p>U.S. actions in Venezuela</p>
<p>Trump is not bluffing</p>
<p>bad precedent</p>
<p>I favor diplomacy</p>
<p>stop the drug cartels</p>
<p>Maduro was bad</p>
<p>our president is inciting violence</p>
<p>Here’s what they said.</p>
<p>January 5, 2026 at 5:00 a.m. ESTToday at 5:00 a.m. EST</p>
<p>What do Americans think about the U.S. military operation that captured <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2026/01/05/venezuela-acting-president-delcy-rodriguez/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template">Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro</a>? What role should the U.S. have in deciding how the country is governed? The Washington Post texted 1,004 Americans to ask.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/tablet/2026/01/05/jan-3-4-2026-washington-post-poll-venezuela-military-action/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template">Post poll</a> finds Americans are almost evenly split between approval and disapproval of the U.S. sending forces to capture Maduro, though most say the operation should have required congressional approval. The public is also skeptical about the U.S. taking control of Venezuela’s government or deciding its leadership.</p>
<p>The poll is a snapshot of the public’s initial reactions to the Venezuela operation during the weekend when many were first learning of the events, with 6 in 10 respondents saying they heard at least “a good amount” about the operation.</p>
<p><i>Participants’ answers have been lightly edited for clarity and style.</i></p>
<h2>Do you approve or disapprove of the United States having sent its military forces into Venezuela to capture Maduro?</h2>
<p>Approve</p>
<p>40%</p>
<p>Unsure</p>
<p>18%</p>
<p>Disapprove</p>
<p>42%</p>
<p>Four in 10 Americans approve of sending military forces into Venezuela to capture Maduro while about the same share disapproves and almost 1 in 5 are unsure.</p>
<p>We need to stop the drug cartels. This is a start.</p>
<p>South Carolina woman, 68, Republican</p>
<p>I don’t want the U.S. getting involved in another completely unnecessary war.</p>
<p>Washington state man, 30, Democrat</p>
<p>Maduro was an illegitimate president. He refused to yield power to the legitimate winner.</p>
<p>Colorado man, 48, independent</p>
<p>I generally dislike the U.S. intervening in other countries’ affairs and especially dislike attempting regime change. It hasn’t been successful in the past.</p>
<p>Texas man, 37, Republican</p>
<p>It is good for the people of Venezuela, but are we doing it for the right reasons?</p>
<p>Massachusetts woman, 66, independent</p>
<p>Reactions to the operation split sharply along partisan lines, with 74 percent of Republicans approving and 76 percent of Democrats disapproving. Slightly more independents disapprove than approve, with a relatively large share saying they are unsure.</p>

<p>45%</p>
<p>Looking forward, The Post poll finds more Americans oppose than support the U.S. taking control of Venezuela and choosing a new government for the country, with a significant 30 percent saying they are unsure. Trump has said the United States will “run the country” for an unspecified period.</p>

Support drops to 18 percent among independents and 9 percent among Democrats, with pluralities or majorities of both groups opposing it.</p>
