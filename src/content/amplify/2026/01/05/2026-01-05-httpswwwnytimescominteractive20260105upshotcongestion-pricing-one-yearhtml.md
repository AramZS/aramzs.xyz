<p>The authors commute to the Times office inside the congestion zone by foot, bus, bike, subway, ferry, tram, Amtrak and occasionally car.</p>
<p>Jan. 4, 2026</p>
<p>One year after the start of congestion pricing, traffic jams are less severe, streets are safer, and commute times are improving for travelers from well beyond Manhattan. Though these changes aren’t noticeable to many, and others feel the tolls are a financial burden, the fees have generated hundreds of millions of dollars for public transportation projects. And it has probably contributed to rising transit ridership.</p>
<p>The program, which on Jan. 5, 2025, began charging most drivers $9 during peak travel times to enter Manhattan below 60th Street, has quickly left its mark.</p>
<p>To assess its impact, The New York Times reviewed city and state data, outside research, and the feedback of more than 600 readers with vastly different views of the toll.</p>
<p>Some groused about high travel costs. Others cheered for a higher toll. Many shared snapshots from their lives: quieter streets, easier parking, costlier trips to the doctor.</p>
<p>Many <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/05/11/upshot/congestion-pricing.html">findings from a Times analysis a few months into the experiment</a> have held up. The program so far has met nearly all of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s goals, although more evidence is needed on some measures. And one question remains unresolved: whether a federal judge will decisively shield the program from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/27/nyregion/nyc-congestion-pricing-trump.html">efforts by the Trump administration to end it</a>.</p>
<p>“Despite the threats to shut it down,” Gov. Kathy Hochul said in an interview, “the cameras are still on, and business is still up, and traffic is still down. So it’s working.”</p>
<p>Here’s the evidence one year in:</p>
<h2>1. Fewer vehicles</h2>
<p>About 73,000 fewer vehicles are entering the central business district each day, a number that has added up in the first year to about 27 million fewer entries. The decline, compared with traffic trends before the toll, has been remarkably stable across the year:</p>

<p>All other consequences of congestion pricing flow from this one — that fewer people are choosing to enter the area by private vehicle.</p>

<p>By influencing that one decision, the policy can also affect commute times, transit reliability, road safety, street life and more (as we’ll get to below).</p>
<p>One clear sign that behaviors are changing: Every weekday, there is now a spike in vehicles entering the zone right before the toll kicks up to $9 at 5 a.m., and right after it declines to $2.25 at 9 p.m.</p>

<h2>2. Faster traffic</h2>
<p>The first consequence of those fewer vehicles is that traffic is now moving faster for the drivers who remain, and for the buses that travel those same roads. And this turns out to be true inside the congestion zone, near the congestion zone, and even much farther away.</p>

<p>Many readers, however, told us they didn’t believe they could see the benefits; the changes aren’t always easy to perceive by the naked eye. Readers also frequently said they believed the gains from congestion pricing were more apparent in the first months of the year and had waned since. The city’s speed data generally suggests that these improvements have been sustained, although some of the largest gains were recorded in the spring.</p>

<p>But for some travelers, the speed gains have been much larger, particularly those who cross through the bridge and tunnel chokepoints into and out of Manhattan:</p>

<p>Improvements have also been more notable for commuters who take longer-distance trips ending in the congestion zone. That’s because those 73,000 vehicles a day that are no longer entering the zone have disappeared from surrounding roads and highways, too.</p>
<p>Commuters from farther out are seeing accumulating benefits from all these sources: faster speeds outside the congestion zone, much faster speeds through the tunnels and bridges, and then the improvements inside Manhattan. And people who travel roads outside the congestion zone without ever entering it get some of these benefits, too.</p>
<p>An analysis by researchers at Stanford, Yale and Google <a href="https://shoshanavasserman.com/files/2025/nyc_congestion_pricing_dec2025.pdf">confirmed this </a>through the program’s first six months. Using anonymized data from trips taken with Google Maps, they found that speeds improved after congestion pricing <em>more</em> on roads around the region commonly traveled by drivers heading into the central business district. That’s a subtle point, but one many readers observed themselves:</p>

<h2>3. More transit riders</h2>
<p>Public transit will benefit from congestion pricing as its proceeds are invested in infrastructure upgrades; in the first year, the toll is projected to raise about $550 million after accounting for expenses, $50 million more than the M.T.A. originally predicted. But transit also stands to benefit as bus speeds improve on decongested roads and as more commuters shift to transit.</p>
<p>On bus routes that cross through the congestion zone, speeds increased this year, in notable contrast to the rest of the city. These improvements follow years of declining bus speeds in the central business district coming out of the pandemic.</p>

<p>Paid transit ridership is up this year compared with 2024 across the subway, M.T.A. buses, Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North Railroad as transit has continued its recovery from pandemic declines. About 300,000 more people are riding the subway each day — far more than the 70,000 cars that have been taken off the road in the congestion zone. So while congestion pricing is probably contributing to rising transit ridership, it’s not the main driver of it.</p>
<p>All of these added transit riders do, however, help explain why congestion pricing has not dampened activity in the busiest parts of the city, as critics feared. People are still coming, just not necessarily by private car.</p>

<p>In fact, overall visits to the business district aren’t down — they were up by about 2.4 percent over the previous year, according to the city’s Economic Development Corporation. And restaurant reservations on the platform OpenTable were up inside the zone as well, by the same amount as the increase citywide.</p>
<p>Tom Harris, the president of the Times Square Alliance, which represents 2,600 businesses, said he had initially received complaints from some businesses. But he was pleasantly surprised that they soon stopped.</p>
<p>“We’re thrilled we have not seen negative impacts to local businesses,” he said. “It seems like it has been absorbed.”</p>
<h2>4. Better quality of life</h2>
<p>These primary shifts — fewer cars, less congested roads, more transit riders — have in turn produced a number of other effects that might more broadly be thought of as changes to qualify of life. Readers described experiencing safer crosswalks, less stressful bike rides and what feels like cleaner air.</p>
<p>In city data, the number of complaints to 311 for vehicle noises like car honking has declined significantly inside the congestion zone, compared with the rest of Manhattan.</p>

<p>And the perception that roads have gotten safer is also borne out by crash data. The number of people who were seriously injured in a car crash decreased citywide, but the improvement was more pronounced in the congestion relief zone.</p>

<p>Amid these positive changes, however, other readers described distinct declines in their quality of life, often stemming from the cost of the toll. These deeply personal observations have no corresponding measures in public data. But they make clear that some of those 27 million fewer driving trips weren’t simply replaced by transit or forgone as unnecessary — they’re missed.</p>

<p>One final aim of congestion pricing — improved air quality — has the potential to benefit everyone in the region. But the data remains inconclusive so far. A recent <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44407-025-00037-2.epdf?sharing_token=DWfBS4Zn9K5BTU18tiWALtRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0PuX7QbH8GcqisbUCMAJiQZC5aTIN22vyd-PD9BlShTPfE-Rup2K0PwHAarL3_MmZU4kh4ZozO1jXnj5GMtfrru-uzO20_kkC7PrXMk-78WDFBqa-wqnJdHKRp6j1nMpn8%3D">study from researchers at Cornell</a> found a 22 percent improvement in one air quality measure over six months. But another analysis, by the Stanford and Yale authors, found little to no effect on air quality using <a href="https://www2.purpleair.com/?srsltid=AfmBOoqfAl4dw1cICPR2eFLa2_jEFwUGC4tgzSVDKaYCPR7rh4de4wTr">local community sensors</a> and comparing New York with other cities. And the M.T.A.’s own analysis of the program’s first year found no significant change in measured concentrations of vehicle-related air pollutants.</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean benefits won’t become clearer with more time and data. But the open questions about air quality underscore that even one year in, even with all the evidence gathered, there are still some effects we don’t fully understand.</p>
