<p>“A few years ago this would have been science fiction,” said UCL’s Prof Waseem Qasim, of the revolutionary gene therapy</p>
<p>A world-first gene therapy which turns white blood cells into a disease-busting “living drug” has reversed previously untreatable blood cancers, according to recently released research funded by Blood Cancer UK.</p>
<p>Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) and King’s College Hospital in London treated nine children and two adults with T-cell leukaemia using the technique, which scientists said triggered a “deep remission” in the majority. Seven are still disease-free three years later.</p>
<p>Developed by GOSH and University College London (UCL), the technique involves editing the genetic code of donor T-cells to target cancer cells without being rejected by the body. This base-editing is an advanced version of CRISPR technology.</p>

<p>“A few years ago this would have been science fiction,” said UCL’s Prof Waseem Qasim. “Now we can take white blood cells from a healthy donor and change a single letter of DNA code in those cells and give them back to patients to try to tackle this hard-to-treat leukaemia.”</p>
<p>In 2022, 13-year-old Alyssa Tapley from Leicestershire was the first in the world to receive the BE-CAR7 treatment. She had not responded to standard therapies, such as chemotherapy or a first bone marrow transplant, and her family had been discussing palliative care options before the research opportunity was proposed.</p>
<p>Dr Rob Chiesa, study investigator and bone marrow transplant consultant at GOSH said: “Although most children with T-cell leukaemia will respond well to standard treatments, around 20% may not. It’s these patients who desperately need better options and this research provides hope for a better prognosis for everyone diagnosed with this rare but aggressive form of blood cancer.”</p>
<p>“I’ve now been able to do some things I thought earlier in my life would be impossible,” said the now 16-year-old, who is cancer-free and has been discharged to long-term follow up. “My ultimate goal is to become a research scientist and be part of the next big discovery that can help people like me.”</p>
