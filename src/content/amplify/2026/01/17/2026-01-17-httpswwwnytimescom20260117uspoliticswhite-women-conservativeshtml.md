<p>In the days since a federal agent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/10/us/rennee-good-ice-shooting-minnesota.html">killed</a> Renee Good in Minneapolis, Republican officials and conservative commentators have called the 37-year-old white woman “very violent,” a “deranged lunatic woman” and a “domestic terrorist.”</p>
<p>Some right-wing influencers have latched onto a different word — or rather an acronym: Ms. Good, they have said, was AWFUL.</p>
<p>“An AWFUL (Affluent White Female Urban Liberal) is dead after running her car into an ICE agent who opened fire on her,” the conservative commentator Erik Erickson <a href="https://x.com/EWErickson/status/2008982506285187125">posted</a> on social media. “Progressive whites are turning violent. ICE agents have the right to defend themselves.”</p>
