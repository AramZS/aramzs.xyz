<p>A few thank yous: Huge thanks to the Manhattan No Kings protestor who let me photograph them with their “Action Absorbs Anxiety” signs. I think about that sign all the time! And many thanks to <a href="https://mariamekaba.com/">Mariame Kaba</a> and <a href="https://www.meganpiontkowski-illustration.com/">Megan Pointkowski</a>, whose work and advocacy with zines made the idea of diving in so much easier. And huge high five to the members of <a href="https://comixaction.com/">Comix Action</a> and <a href="https://indivisiblebrooklyn.org/">Indivisible Brooklyn</a> and other activist friends who gave me feedback as I worked on this thing!</p>
