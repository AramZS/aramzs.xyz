<p>Tensions continued early on Thursday in Minneapolis, as protesters clashed in the streets with law enforcement, following the second shooting there in about a week involving a federal officer.</p>
<p>The Department of Homeland Security said that on Wednesday, a federal law enforcement officer shot a person, who they say had fled a traffic stop and then, along with two other people, began attacking the officer.</p>
<p>That incident followed the fatal shooting of Renee Good, a 37-year-old mother, on Jan. 7. DHS officials said Good was allegedly attempting to run over law enforcement officers when an ICE officer fatally shot her -- a claim that local officials have disputed.</p>
<h2>Key Headlines</h2>
<p>Some 1,500 active duty Army paratroopers have been put on alert for a potential deployment to Minnesota, according to two defense officials.</p>
<p>The soldiers are from the 11th Airborne Division, based at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Alaska, one of the Army's premier infantry formations and a frontline force in the U.S. military presence in the Pacific, positioned to help deter China. The division is also the military's leading formation for Arctic warfare.</p>
<p>One official said the president had not made a final decision on whether to deploy two battalions. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>

<p>"We are taking prudent steps to prepare active-duty Army forces," the official said. "This doesn't mean they will deploy; we are preparing options."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, members of the Minnesota National Guard remain on state orders under the authority of Gov. Tim Walz. It would be unusual for federalized active-duty troops and state-activated Guard forces to be deployed simultaneously and while serving under different legal frameworks. National Guard units can also be federalized and placed under the president's command.</p>

<p>President Donald Trump on Thursday threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act to send in the U.S. military as tensions intensified in Minneapolis following a second shooting involving a federal officer during immigration operations. However, Trump later told reporters he didn't think there was "any reason right now to use it."</p>
<p>The 11th Airborne troops were recalled to base on Friday, amid the long holiday weekend, to stand by as a so-called quick reaction force, a rapid-deployment force, according to an internal notice to the unit's leadership, reviewed by ABC News.</p>

<p>It was not immediately known if there were arrests.</p>

<p>The Minnesota Department of Public Safety said Saturday that Walz ordered the Minnesota National Guard to be mobilized and are staging to support local law enforcement.</p>
<p>"They are not deployed to city streets at this time, but are ready to help support public safety, including protection of life, preservation of property and supporting the rights of all who assemble peacefully," the department said.</p>
<p>Minnesota National Guard troops remain on standby as of late Saturday afternoon. In a statement, the Guard said that if troops were deployed, they would wear reflective vests "to help distinguish them from other agencies in similar uniforms."</p>
<p>Federal law enforcement officers, including agents with ICE, routinely wear multicam uniforms, the same camouflage pattern used by the Army, Air Force and Space Force.</p>
<p>There have been concerns in the past over the conduct of law enforcement wearing military style uniforms, and that conduct being misconstrued as service members.</p>
<p>In recent years, Guard units have tried to distinguish themselves from police with uniform alterations, like reflective vests and unique patches.</p>
<p>Walz again urged protesters to be peaceful.</p>
<p>"Our public safety team has the resources, coordination, and personnel on the ground to maintain public safety and respond if needed," he said in a statement.</p>

<p>The Minnesota Guard has been mobilized and is on standby to support law enforcement ahead of protests expected to unfold in Minneapolis over the weekend, officials said.</p>
<p>Right now, troops are on standby at their bases and not on the streets. They were in a similar posture last week.</p>
<p>At a news briefing on Friday, Maj. Gen. Shawn Manke, the commander of the Minnesota Guard, described the deployment’s purpose as “to protect life and property.”</p>
<p>It’s unclear how many troops are mobilized. Walz's office declined to comment. The Minnesota Guard did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>“I don’t know if you’ll see National Guard in the neighborhoods or not,” Manke said at the briefing. “It’s going to depend on what the needs are.”</p>
<p>Last week, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz authorized the National Guard to be "staged and ready to support" law enforcement if needed.</p>
