<h2>Qwen 3.8 27B is excellent, but it defaults to wildly overthinking things</h2>
<p>Friday’s big release was <a href="https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3.8-27B">Qwen 3.8 27B</a>, an Apache 2 licensed 27B parameter vision-capable LLM from Alibaba’s Qwen research lab. I’ve been looking forward to this one: 27B is an excellent size for running a model on a reasonably specced laptop, and its predecessor <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2026/Apr/22/qwen36-27b/">Qwen 3.6 27B</a> was impressive.</p>
<p>Qwen’s <a href="https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3.8-27B#benchmark-results">self-reported benchmarks</a> for this model are eye-opening. They show a boost from both Qwen 3.6 27B <em>and</em> the closed-weight Qwen 3.7-Plus, which was one of Qwen’s strongest models of any size as recently as <a href="https://qwen.ai/blog?id=qwen3.7-plus">May this year</a>. It will be interesting to hear what independent benchmarks have to say about the model.</p>
<p>I’ve been running the model on two different machines: my 128GB M5 Max MacBook Pro, and an <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/14/nvidia-dgx-spark/">NVIDIA DGX Spark</a>. On both machines I’m running LM Studio and <a href="https://lmstudio.ai/models/qwen3.8">their 17GB Q4_K_M quantized build</a>. I also tried using <code>llama-server</code> directly on the Spark.</p>
<h4>The default of extra high results in spectacular over-thinking <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2026/Aug/16/qwen-38-27b/#the-default-of-extra-high-results-in-spectacular-over-thinking">#</a></h4>
<p>Qwen’s documentation describes the model as defaulting to <code>xhigh</code> for the reasoning effort, and the LM Studio GGUF I’ve been trying preserves that default:</p>
<blockquote> <p>Qwen3.8 comes with official support for <code>reasoning_effort</code>, which can be used to adjust reasoning depth and control cost:</p> <ul> <li> <code>xhigh</code> (default): for complex tasks demanding thorough analysis</li> <li> <code>medium</code>: balancing accuracy and speed</li> <li> <code>low</code>: efficient reasoning optimizing for speed and cost</li> </ul> </blockquote>
<p>This is a <em>hilarious</em> default. It’s absolutely not a good way to run the model, especially on consumer hardware. I’ve been finding the results extremely entertaining.</p>
<p>I quickly ran into problems with LM Studio’s default context limit of 8,192 tokens—Qwen was using them all up thinking about even the most mundane of problems. I loaded the model with the full 262,144 maximum context length and that problem went away.</p>
<p>Here’s <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/markdown-svg-renderer#url=https%3A%2F%2Fgist.github.com%2Fsimonw%2Ffc909bea4fecf752c7bf9bad0e9dbf2a">the pelican riding a bicycle</a> SVG I got from my first attempt with that increased context length. It took <strong>21 minutes</strong> to generate, using 22,276 reasoning tokens to produce 3,223 tokens of output. You can read <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/markdown-svg-renderer#url=https%3A%2F%2Fgist.github.com%2Fsimonw%2Ffc909bea4fecf752c7bf9bad0e9dbf2a">the reasoning trace here</a>.</p>
<figure><img alt="A very pleasing image of a pelican riding a bicycle. The bicycle is red and has the correct frame shape. The pelican looks like a pelican and has its wing extended to the handlebars." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/qwen-thinking-bicycle-27b.jpg"/></figure>
<p>This is by far the best pelican SVG I’ve been able to generate with a model that runs on a local machine—and this Qwen is pretty small, just a 17GB file on disk. There’s a lot to like about this:</p>
<ol> <li>The bicycle frame is the right shape</li> <li>It has legs on each side of the bike—that’s <em>very</em> rare</li> <li>Good, clear pelican pouch</li> <li>The wings extend to touch the handlebars!</li> <li>The motion lines are behind, not in front</li> <li>It has a tasteful background—nice sun, clouds, hill, flowers and grass.</li> </ol>
<p>Was that worth waiting 21 minutes for? Absolutely not.</p>
<p>Here’s that same prompt run with reasoning turned off—<a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/markdown-svg-renderer#url=https%3A%2F%2Fgist.github.com%2Fsimonw%2F1265cfa8dce2f9ad5eb160792ff45a49">transcript here</a>. This one produced <strong>3,715 tokens</strong> and took 137s—just over two minutes.</p>
<figure><img alt="The bicycle frame is a bad shape now. The pelican remains recognizable but has a less obvious pouch. The feet miss the pedal, there is no attempt to hold the handlebars." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/qwen-3.8-27b-no-reasoning-pelican-2.png"/></figure>
<p>And just for completeness, I used OpenRouter to run the same prompt through the much larger Qwen 3.8 2.4T-A95B (released <a href="https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3.8-2.4T-A95B">last week</a>) and got this snazzy <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/markdown-svg-renderer#url=https%3A%2F%2Fgist.github.com%2Fsimonw%2F557016f0895b2abb4b9957caec781734">animated SVG</a>:</p>

<p>I said Qwen at xhigh has a tendency to over-think things, but how bad really is it?</p>
<p>I tried a much simpler prompt, again with that default extra high setting:</p>
<blockquote> <p><code>draw an svg of a circle</code></p> </blockquote>
<p>Qwen’s reasoning trace started like this:</p>
<blockquote> <p>The user is asking for an SVG drawing of a circle. Simple request — but I want it to be a carefully crafted piece. Let me make something that goes beyond just <code>&lt;circle&gt;</code>: a single self-contained SVG file with character — maybe a geometric “circle study,” with subtle animation, layered rings, and a distinctive palette.</p> <p>Keep the scope right: they asked for an SVG of a circle. So the core is a circle. But I can add craft: concentric guide circles (like a compass/geometry drawing), tick marks, a soft gradient fill on the main circle, restrained ambient motion (a slowly rotating dashed ring, pulsing glow). Respect prefers-reduced-motion? That’s more for CSS; SVG SMIL or CSS inside SVG will do.</p> <p>Palette options: deep teal ink on warm paper? Or bold vermilion circle on off-white with navy construction lines — Bauhaus/compass-drawing vibe. Let me go with a “geometric study” look: cool slate background, or bright paper white? Paper white is fine if it’s not the cream-and-terracotta combo. [...]</p> </blockquote>
<p>Several minutes later it <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/markdown-svg-renderer#url=https%3A%2F%2Fgist.github.com%2Fsimonw%2F6f9e48293be5c916652d29f0dc0b0657">produced</a> this <em>absolutely beautiful</em> animated circle, which was entirely not what I had asked for!</p>
<figure><video controls="controls" height="1080" loop="loop" width="1078"> <source src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/circle-web.mp4" type="video/mp4"/> Your browser does not support HTML5 video. </video></figure>
<p>My strong recommendation: ignore that default. Run Qwen 3.8 27B on low or even no reasoning levels at first. It’s a great model, but wow that default setting is a bad place to start.</p>
<h4>It’s very good at bounding boxes <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2026/Aug/16/qwen-38-27b/#it-s-very-good-at-bounding-boxes">#</a></h4>
<p>A fun way to test a vision model is to see how well it can return bounding boxes around items in a photograph. I’ve seen previous Qwen models deal well with this, so I decided to put it to the test drawing bounding boxes around some pelicans.</p>
<p>I’ve seen asking for 0-1000 scale produce good results in the past. I tried this:</p>
<pre>llm -a https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/714731804/large.jpg \
  -m lmstudio/qwen/qwen3.8-27b \
  'Return JSON bounding boxes for the pelicans in this photo, 0-1000 scale for each dimension'</pre>
<p>Here’s <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/a05cc78b2061555bd61d3bb9686e689f">the reasoning trace</a>, which produced this:</p>
<pre>[
  {"bbox_2d": [195, 290, 370, 780], "label": "pelicans"},
  {"bbox_2d": [445, 320, 675, 850], "label": "pelicans"}
]</pre>
<p>This is <em>such a good match</em>. Here are those boxes rendered on top of the photo:</p>
<figure><img alt="A photograph of two pelicans on a rocky outcrop, with three other smaller birds. The pelicans both have bounding boxes exactly surrounding them, each with a label that says pelican." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/qwen-over-engineered-bbox.webp"/></figure>
<h4>Building a tool to label bounding boxes <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2026/Aug/16/qwen-38-27b/#building-a-tool-to-label-bounding-boxes">#</a></h4>
<p>That visualization of the bounding boxes was taken using a new custom tool that I had Qwen 3.8 27B build for me, running offline on my laptop.</p>
<p>I forgot to dial down the thinking effort so it was <em>massively over-engineered</em>, but it did manage to produce <a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/qwen-over-thinking-bbox.html">this full interface</a> from <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/121ad098860028b2fab603fa12da1fd9">this single prompt</a>:</p>
<blockquote> <pre><code>[
   {"bbox_2d": [195, 290, 370, 780], "label": "pelicans"},
   {"bbox_2d": [445, 320, 675, 850], "label": "pelicans"}
]
</code></pre> <p><code>Build an HTML page which has an input box for accepting the URL to an image and a textarea for accepting the above style of JSON.</code></p> <p><code>It appends the image to the page, measures its width and height, then treats the coords in the bbox_2d as scaled from 0-1000 and scales them against the actual width and height, then it renders labelled boxes over the image.</code></p> </blockquote>
<p>This screenshot shows one of the features I did <em>not</em> ask for—a demo scene, for if you don’t have a photograph to test the tool with:</p>
<figure><img alt='Screenshot of bbox·lab, a dark-themed web tool that overlays object-detection bounding boxes on an image, with an input panel on the left and a stage on the right showing two labeled boxes around stylized pelicans in a sunset illustration. Header: bbox·lab — normalized 0–1000 coords → pixel overlay; status indicator: RENDERED · 2 BOXES. Panel 01 INPUT (URL + detections) contains an IMAGE URL field reading data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAA+, a DETECTIONS — JSON textarea reading {"bbox_2d": 195, 290, 370, 780, "label": "pelicans"}, {"bbox_2d": 445, 320, 675, 850, "label": "pelicans"} , an orange RENDER BOXES button, and dashed boxes labeled DEMO SCENE and CLEAR. Panel 03 STAGE header: display 661 × 661 px · 1 unit = 0.661px x 0.661px · nat 1000×1000. The stage shows a flat-style illustration of two dark pelican silhouettes with orange beaks standing in calm water against an orange-to-purple sunset sky with a pale yellow sun and distant birds; an orange bounding box labeled 1 · pelicans surrounds the left pelican and a cyan bounding box labeled 2 · pelicans surrounds the right pelican. Footer: move the cursor over the image to read grid coords; boxes map 0–1000 → displayed px.' src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/qwen-full-ui-with-pelicans.webp"/></figure>
<p>Here’s the relevant segment of the thinking trace, where it decided to draw its own pelicans purely because I had used the label “pelicans” in the example JSON I gave it in the prompt:</p>
<blockquote> <p>Also a “load sample” that uses a known image? Can’t depend on external images, but… the image URL input is user-provided; I could add a “try with sample” button [...] Hmm, I can draw a simple scene on canvas, export it as a data URL, and load it into the image — that’s self-contained and demo-able! [...] But the user’s coords are for an actual pelican image; a generated placeholder can still demo the scaling. Generate a 1000x1000 placeholder: gradient water + two blob-like “pelican” silhouettes placed at the given bboxes (using the same scale — cute: silhouettes at the exact 0-1000 positions, showing the boxes align). This makes for a fun, self-contained demo. Keep it simple: sky gradient, sun, water, two pelican-ish shapes (ellipse body, circle head, beak). Place at bbox centers.</p> </blockquote>
<p>(I’m slightly nervous that models around the world might have a bias towards drawing pelicans at any chance they can get, brought on by nearly two years of exposure to my own stupid benchmark.)</p>
<p>Is all that over-thinking necessary? Maybe it is, at least a bit. I tried with reasoning turned off and got <a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/qwen-no-thinking-bbox.html">this version</a>, (<a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/8e78b1c64d9a56d08eedb954aa9445ee">transcript here</a>), which nearly works but shows the boxes in the wrong place:</p>
<figure><img alt="BBox Studio screenshot - a solid UI but the yellow and green boxes do not cover the pelicans." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/qwen-no-reasoning-bug.webp"/></figure>
<p>So without reasoning it didn’t quite one-shot a working tool. I’m sure it could get there with some follow-up prompts, but this is a good example of how reasoning can make a difference.</p>
<h4>Yes, it can drive coding agents <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2026/Aug/16/qwen-38-27b/#yes-it-can-drive-coding-agents">#</a></h4>
<p>One of the biggest questions around local models is whether or not they have enough horsepower to successfully run a coding agent loop. Coding agents require long context, strong code generation support and reliable tool-calling. On paper Qwen 3.8 27B has all three of these, so is it up to the task?</p>
<p>My initial experiments with <a href="https://pi.dev/">Pi</a> have been very promising. I chose Pi because it has a shorter system prompt than most other options, making it a better fit for trying out smaller models.</p>
<p>I configured Pi to use Qwen 3.8 27B running in LM Studio on the Spark (shared via <code>tailscale serve</code>) by adding this to <code>~/.pi/agent/models.json</code>:</p>
<pre>{
  "providers": {
    "spark": {
      "baseUrl": "https://spark-18b3.tail68a31.ts.net/v1",
      "api": "openai-responses",
      "apiKey": "dummy",
      "models": [
        {
          "id": "qwen3.8-27b",
          "reasoning": true
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}</pre>
<p>Then ran <code>pi --provider spark --model qwen3.8-27b</code> in my <code>~/dev/datasette</code> folder and prompted:</p>
<blockquote> <p><code>how does auth work?</code></p> </blockquote>
<p>After a sequence of reasoning and tool calls that accessed a bunch of different files it produced <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/6693d74a6bd45f641d43ceb9961dd95f#core-idea-actors--plugins-no-built-in-user-accounts">this reply</a>, which is very solid.</p>
<p>Just one problem: I wanted to share that transcript. So I pointed Pi and Qwen 3.8 27B at the JSONL transcript file in <code>~/.pi/agent/sessions/--Users-simon-Dropbox-dev-datasette--</code> and prompted:</p>
<blockquote> <p><code>Write Python code to convert this jsonl to markdown</code></p> </blockquote>
<p>And it built and tested this <a href="https://github.com/simonw/tools/blob/main/python/pi_jsonl_to_md.py">pi_jsonl_to_md.py</a>, which did exactly what I needed. Here’s <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/491e55ac9d741202ea0af5d9d93775d4">that session transcript</a>, published using the tool that it created.</p>
<h4>The quest for speed <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2026/Aug/16/qwen-38-27b/#the-quest-for-speed">#</a></h4>
<p>So far this is all looking <em>very</em> promising. We have a 17GB model that runs on high-end consumer hardware and can write code, drive tools, annotate images and generally do everything that I need from an LLM for getting real work done.</p>
<p>There’s one very significant catch: it feels slow—especially when it starts over-thinking, but even without that it’s not particularly sprightly.</p>
<p>I’ve been getting around 15-30 tokens a second from LM Studio. That’s not terrible, but it’s slow enough that it’s going to be hard to win me away from hosted API models, which can return results a whole lot faster. Artificial Analysis <a href="https://artificialanalysis.ai/models#speed">track token speed</a> and show OpenAI 5.6 Sol at 74 tokens/second and 5.6 Luna at an impressive 184/second.</p>
<p>The good news is that the community have been exploring ways to speed things up since the model was first released two days ago.</p>
<p>One of the most promising optimizations is baked into the model itself. Qwen supports <a href="https://sebastianraschka.com/llm-architecture-gallery/mtp/">Multi-Token Prediction</a>, an architecture trick where a cheaper mechanism guesses several tokens ahead and the main model can then quickly verify if the guesses were correct. This can have quite a dramatic effect on inference performance.</p>
<p>Based on <a href="https://twitter.com/ggerganov/status/2088340681701925253">this tweet</a> from <code>llama.cpp</code> creator Georgi Gerganov I tried running the model with MTP like this on the Spark:</p>
<pre>llama serve \
 -hf  ggml-org/Qwen3.8-27B-GGUF:Q4_K_M \
 -hfd ggml-org/Qwen3.8-27B-GGUF:Q4_0 \
 --spec-default \
 --spec-type draft-mtp \
 --reasoning-preserve</pre>
<p>And sure enough, this gave me a significant boost. I had GPT-5.6 in Codex run <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/b08c7eb9c126c806ba8987e269ea736b">a comparative benchmark on the Spark</a> and the <code>--spec-type draft-mtp</code> server outperformed the LM Studio default GGUF by around 72%.</p>
<p>I expect we’ll see a whole lot more innovation around serving this model faster over the next few weeks. The MLX community likely have some tricks brewing as well.</p>
<h4>Some observations <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2026/Aug/16/qwen-38-27b/#some-observations">#</a></h4>
<p>The fact that a 17GB file can do all of this stuff on my home machines is a <em>miracle</em>. Once again, I’m delighted and amazed at how much progress local models have made this year. A year ago this would have been competitive with the best and most expensive of the proprietary models—today it can run on a capable laptop.</p>
<p>The only thing holding this back from being a daily driver is performance. It feels pretty slow on both the M5 Mac and the DGX Spark. That’s the catch with these dense (non-Mixture-of-Experts) models—they require a whole lot of memory bandwidth to perform well, and neither of the machines I have access to are top performers in that regard.</p>
<p>The most important thing about Qwen 3.8 27B is <strong>what it demonstrates</strong>. We can have an open weights general purpose model with a long context, effective tool calling, strong vision ability, and competent code generation, and we can fit the whole thing in just a 17GB file.</p>
<p>The models at this size continue to get better at an impressive rate. We don’t need to spend half a million dollars on datacenter-class hardware just to run a competent model.</p>
