  Tiles ([[tiles]]) are intended for use in a diversity of
  environements.         Depending on the environment that they find themselves
  embedded in, they         will have access to different capabilities that
  expose various features         and communicate with the host environment.
  Tiles Protocols are the         mechanisms through which these integrations
  are made available.

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Tiles are intended to be embedded in many different contexts, but also to be strongly sandboxed to keep them from exfiltrating data. This means that features like passing data to and from a tile need specific handling. That's what Tiles Protocols are for.</p>
<p>Because a tile does not necessarily know what environment it's embedded in, it's up to the embedding environment to provide the implementation for a given protocol. The tile simply loads it according to a shared convention and then uses the documented interface to use the protocol implementation it has loaded as a black box.</p>
<h2>Protocol Loading</h2>
<p>All protocols are loaded from resources under <code>/.well-known/web-tiles/</code>. Note that this path is reserved and that trying to include content under it in a tile will almost certainly fail. An imaginary Cat tiles protocol could be loaded for instance from <code>/.well-known/web-tiles/cats.js</code>. If the embeddeding environment supports cats, that resource will resolve, if it doesn't the load will error.</p>
<p>The JavaScript loading pattern for a protocol is always the same:</p>
<pre><code data-highlighted="yes">try {
  const protocolApi = await import('/.well-known/web-tiles/some-protocol.js');
  // Use protocolApi like the JS object it is.
}
catch (err) {
  // Handle whatever the tile does when this protocol isn't available.
  // If it's essential, at least show the user a message.
}
      </code></pre>
<h2>Registered Protocols</h2>
<p>This table lists all the currently registered resource name under <code>/.well-known/web-tiles/</code>. Note that some cannot be usefully loaded as protocols and just act as reserved paths that may be present in some environments.</p>
<table> <tr> <th>name</th> <th>source</th> <th>notes</th> </tr> <tbody> <tr> <td><code>index.html</code></td> <td>reserved</td> <td>Loader in web contexts.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><code>shuttle.js</code></td> <td>reserved</td> <td>Code for loader in web contexts.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><code>worker.js</code></td> <td>reserved</td> <td>Service Worker in web contexts.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><code>data.js</code></td> <td>[<a href="https://dasl.ing/tiles-protocols.html#ref-tp-data">tp-data</a>]</td> <td>Data passing to and from tiles.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><code>store.js</code></td> <td>[<a href="https://dasl.ing/tiles-protocols.html#ref-tp-editable">tp-editable</a>]</td> <td>Self-editing tiles, the protocol can read and write from the tile's store.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table>
<h2>Usage Notes</h2>
<p>Tiles can be hosted in a great variety of environments, and each of these environments may have different technical ways of establishing communication between host and tile. That is why it is important for tiles to create this communication by loading from the <code>/.well-known/web-tiles/some-protocol.js</code> resource rather than include a specific protocol implementation because they may be getting different implementations in different environments.</p>
<p>It's worth noting however that in most cases the communication will go through <code>postMessage</code> across the tile boundary, and in all cases the expectation is that the data passed over the boundary should transfer according to the behaviour of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Structured_clone_algorithm">structured clones</a>.</p>
<p>In web contexts, the communication will therefore be <code>postMessage</code> content. By convention, the data passed via <code>postMessage</code> will have an <code>action</code> field prefixed with <code>tiles-protocol-up-</code> if it's going from the tile to the host and with <code>tiles-protocol-down-</code> if it's going from the host to the tile. It will be accompanied by a <code>payload</code> field that contains the data being passed.</p>
