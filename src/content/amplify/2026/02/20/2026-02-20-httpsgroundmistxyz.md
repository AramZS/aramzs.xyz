<h2>AT Protocol meets local-first software</h2>
<p>Groundmist is a series of progressive experiments exploring the possibilities enabled by connecting the <a href="https://atproto.com">AT Protocol</a> and the <a href="https://inkandswitch.com/local-first">local-first software</a> paradigm.</p>
<h2>Experiment 1: Distribution</h2>
<p>This project reuses <a href="https://atproto.com/guides/identity">AT Protocol's identity system</a> to create a connection between private and public data known only to the user, adding a distribution layer to the local-first software ecosystem with the following benefits:</p>
<ul><li>1-click publishing for local-first data</li><li>data that originates in disparate local-first contexts is unified when published, without manual intervention</li><li>published local-first data can be displayed and viewed flexibly according to user or viewer preference using atproto AppViews</li></ul>

<p>Groundmist Library is an example application where you can privately curate personal content and selectively publish a subset to your atproto PDS. It demonstrates how local-first data can be seamlessly distributed through the AT Protocol while maintaining privacy and user control.</p>
<h2>Experiment 2: Legibility</h2>
<p>This project applies <a href="https://atproto.com/specs/lexicon">AT Protocol's Lexicon schema system</a> to local-first software and data. This adds a legibility layer that enables flexible interfaces for interacting with local-first data, without duplicating data or causing issues with consistency and incompatibility.</p>
<ul><li>atproto applications can use local-first AppViews for managing private data before it gets published to the protocol</li><li>local-first data from one app can be read or updated from a different local-first app preferred by the user for a specific task or context</li><li>local-first data from multiple local-first applications can be composed within an entirely new application</li></ul>

<p>Groundmist Editor is a local-first collaborative editor for writing and editing markdown documents and then publishing them to atproto. For its data schema, it uses the <a href="https://whtwnd.com">WhiteWind</a> blog entry lexicon (<em>com.whtwnd.blog.entry</em>), which means it offers a private environment for drafting (and publishing) WhiteWind blog posts. It's accompanied by Groundmist Notebook, an alternative AppView for reading published work that uses the <em>com.whtwnd.blog.entry</em> lexicon. It can be used to read any posts published from WhiteWind or Groundmist Editor.</p>
<h2>Experiment 3: Interoperability &amp; Composability</h2>
<p>This project explores a lightweight way to create a unified personal data store for local-first data that is analagous to the <a href="https://atproto.com/guides/glossary#pds-personal-data-server">atproto PDS</a> but private by default. It achieves this by switching from the app-specific sync server architecture common to local-first software to a personal sync server architecture (PSS).</p>
<ul><li>when logged in with atproto id, local-first app data is automatically synced to the user's PSS, unifying it into a personal data store</li><li>PSS data is structured, making it discoverable and composable (with permission), like data in a user's atproto PDS</li><li>the local-first data store on the PSS is portable, like a user's atproto identity or PDS</li></ul>

<p>Groundmist Sync is a self-hosted personal sync server which is owned by your atproto identity. When you log in to other Groundmist applications (Library or Notebook), data will automatically sync to this server, unifying your local-first data into a personal data store that is analogous to your atproto PDS, but private.</p>
<h2>Interesting Future Directions</h2>
<p>While these experiments show interesting potential in connecting AT Protocol with local-first software, there are also a number of challenges and opportunities for future exploration and development.</p>
<ul><li>Data schemas change over time and needs differ by context (e.g. public vs. private). Ink &amp; Switch has done interesting work in this area with the <a href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/cambria/">Cambria project</a> for "data lenses". Creating a global lens network on top of Lexicon's global schema network would be a powerful addition to this model, and <a href="https://github.com/lexicon-community/governance/issues/14">community discussion</a> has recently begun.</li><li>Safely allowing data interoperability and composability to enable flexible application interfaces requires sophisticated authorization and granular access control mechanisms. Capability-based authorization projects like <a href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/keyhive/notebook/">Keyhive</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ucan-wg/ucan">UCAN</a> are interesting to consider.</li><li>The personal sync server architecture doesn't support collaboration on its own. One interesting exploration would be to extend AT Protocol's federation model to personal sync servers, enabling selective sharing of local-first data.</li><li>Personal data stores of structured local-first data present interesting possibilities for social applications based around private data using cryptographic tools such as Private Set Intersection, similar to or expanding on explorations done by the <a href="https://www.cursive.team/">Cursive team.</a> </li><li>AT Protocol provides data verifiability. It would be interesting to explore verifiable change histories for composable local-first data. This could enable users to review the history of which applications changed their data. It could also enable importing data with a verifiable provenance (e.g. a digitally signed photograph), making verifiable changes, and then publishing the modified data alongside a zero knowledge proof of its origin and change history.</li></ul>
