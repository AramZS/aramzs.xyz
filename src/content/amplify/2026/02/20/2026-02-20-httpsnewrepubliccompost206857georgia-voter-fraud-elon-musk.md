<p>If Donald Trump’s administration really wants to find evidence of foreign interference in Georgia’s elections, then they need look no further than the president’s old friend Elon Musk and his shady super PAC.</p>
<p>Members of the Georgia State Elections Board <a href="https://www.11alive.com/article/news/politics/georgia-state-election-board-letter-of-reprimand-america-pac-pre-filled-absentee-ballot-applications/85-ddb4f02a-a78a-4931-80e7-0fab668727c4">voted</a> Wednesday to issue a formal letter of reprimand to Musk’s America PAC over the billionaire technocrat’s illegal scheme to get Trump elected. Georgia, a key battleground state in 2024, was the target of aggressive campaigning by Trump’s team.</p>
<p>In October 2024, the Georgia secretary of state’s office launched an investigation after receiving numerous reports from residents across several counties saying they’d received partially prefilled absentee ballot applications from Musk’s America PAC, according to John Fervier, the State Elections Board’s chairman.</p>
<p>There was evidence to suggest America PAC had violated a <a href="https://law.justia.com/codes/georgia/title-21/chapter-2/article-10/section-21-2-381/">state law</a> that prohibits any person or entity, other than an authorized relative, to send an elector an absentee ballot application prefilled with the elector’s required information, according to Janice Johnston, the SEB’s vice chairman.</p>
<p>America PAC had also failed to display in a conspicuous location that this was not an official government publication, was not provided by the government, and was not a ballot, Johnston added.</p>
<p>The board swiftly voted to issue a letter of reprimand to America PAC.</p>
<p>This letter comes weeks after Trump <a href="https://newrepublic.com/post/206177/donald-trump-tulsi-gabbard-georgia-raid">suggested</a> that his Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard was <a href="https://newrepublic.com/post/205852/tulsi-gabbard-fbi-raid-georgia-election-office">spotted lurking around</a> a federal raid at the election office in Fulton County, Georgia, because she was investigating foreign interference in elections.</p>
<p>It should come as no surprise that the only evidence of meddling with people’s votes came from Trump’s own camp—<a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/177026/voter-fraud-myth-fake-electors">the same thing happened in the 2020 election too</a>.</p>
