<p>Milo went missing.</p>
<p>Yet it wasn’t the lost puppy that gave people the jitters — it was the promise behind the story: That a communitywide web of home security systems could transform a neighborhood into a “Search Party.”</p>
<p>The Super Bowl commercial <a data-ylk="slk:set off public backlash;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/14/business/amazon-ring-flock-partnership-super-bowl.html">set off public backlash</a> against two leading surveillance companies, Amazon, which owns Ring doorbell cameras, and Flock Safety, which makes license plate reader cameras. Within days, the e-commerce giant announced it was ditching a planned partnership with Atlanta-based Flock.</p>
<p>Privacy advocates said the breakup represented a rare, high-profile retreat from the expansion of surveillance-driven policing — and that school leaders should take note.</p>

<p>“The fact that Amazon is reconsidering their relationship with Flock should be a very large and glaring sign that schools should also perhaps reconsider that relationship,” said Kristin Woelfel, policy counsel for equity in civic technology at the nonprofit Center for Democracy and Technology.</p>
<p>In an investigation last week, The 74 revealed that <a data-ylk="slk:police nationwide routinely tapped into school district Flock cameras;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://www.the74million.org/article/ice-taps-into-school-security-cameras-to-aid-trumps-immigration-crackdown-74-investigation-shows/">police nationwide routinely tapped into school district Flock cameras</a> to assist President Donald Trump’s mass immigration crackdown, which has also led to public outcry and protest over the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s <a data-ylk="slk:unprecedented surveillance tactics.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/department-of-homeland-security-intensifies-surveillance-in-immigration-raids-sweeping-in-citizens">unprecedented surveillance tactics.</a></p>

<h4>ICE Taps into School Security Cameras to Aid Trump’s Immigration Crackdown</h4>
<p>Ring’s planned integration with Flock Safety would have allowed homeowners to share their camera feeds with the police. The company said the collaboration was never launched but it still plans to roll out “Search Party” to homeowners, first for “finding dogs” <a data-ylk="slk:and soon to “zero out crime.”;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://www.404media.co/leaked-email-suggests-ring-plans-to-expand-search-party-surveillance-beyond-dogs/?ref=daily-stories-newsletter">and soon to “zero out crime.”</a></p>
<p>Some 100 school districts across the country have contracted with Flock, according to government procurement records. Their cameras are designed to capture license plate numbers, timestamps and other identifying details, which are uploaded to a cloud server. Flock customers, including schools, can decide whether to share their information with other police agencies in the company’s national network.</p>

<p>Woelfel’s warning lands amid <a data-ylk="slk:growing scrutiny of that sprawling nationwide system;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://www.404media.co/ice-taps-into-nationwide-ai-enabled-camera-network-data-shows/">growing scrutiny of that sprawling nationwide system </a>of automated license plate readers and their use by federal immigration agents to track down targets. Flock audit logs obtained by The 74 and interviews reveal local police departments nationwide are searching school district-run surveillance networks to aid the DHS in immigration enforcement cases.</p>
<p>The logs were from Texas school districts that contract with Flock and showed that law enforcement agencies far beyond their borders — including in Florida, Georgia, Indiana and Tennessee — routinely conducted searches on the districts’ campus feeds, tagging reasons such as “Immigration (criminal)” and “Immigration (civil/administrative).” Multiple law enforcement officials acknowledged the searches were done at the request of federal immigration agents, with one saying the local assist was given without hesitation.</p>
<p>Ring spokesperson Emma Daniels said the company doesn’t contract with school districts directly. The company’s “terminated integration with Flock” is specific to a tool that allows local police “to request video footage from Ring users in a specific area during a defined time period” to help in investigations related to “a car theft, a burglary or other local safety concerns.”</p>
<p>Flock spokesperson Holly Beilin said the Ring partnership “had nothing to do with any of our school customers,” which rely on the automated license plate readers to navigate parent custody logistics and in parking lots where “most incidents of violence at schools take place.” In December, district <a data-ylk="slk:officials in Cleveland leveraged Flock camera;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://www.ideastream.org/education/2025-12-15/cleveland-schools-teachers-ask-for-help-after-more-than-100-cars-broken-into-in-recent-weeks">officials in Cleveland leveraged Flock camera</a>s to investigate a rash of car break-ins in school parking lots. Immigration and Customs enforcement agents have <a data-ylk="slk:shown up at parking lots;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://www.k12dive.com/news/ice-activity-on-k-12-school-grounds/810648/">shown up at parking lots</a> during school pick-up and drop-off to target immigrant families.</p>

<p>Beilin said she didn’t know how frequently school-owned Flock networks were being queried on behalf of ICE, but that the company had rolled out <a data-ylk="slk:a search filter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://www.flocksafety.com/blog/does-flock-share-data-with-ice">a search filter</a> that allows customers to disable immigration-related searches on their devices.</p>
<figure><img alt="Kristin Woelfel" data-nimg="1" src="https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/vlPsJ7MWWv.lsrqLFXsP1g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTQyMDtoPTQyMDtjZj13ZWJw/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_74_articles_792/73be0c3399840b82b506087703baffc0"/><figcaption>Kristin Woelfel</figcaption></figure>
<p>“If school district police, or, frankly any police, decides that that is against their policy, they can turn that search filter on,” Beilin told The 74. “So any of those searches would be filtered out.”</p>
<p>There is no evidence from The 74’s analysis that the Texas school districts use the devices for their own immigration-related investigations, but the audit logs raise questions about how broadly school safety data are being fed into the far-reaching surveillance tool.</p>
<p>That school Flock cameras are being accessed by out-of-state police officers for immigration enforcement is “a really serious privacy issue for children and families” Woelfel said.</p>
<p>“You have to think about what effect it’s ultimately going to have on the community,” she continued. “Even in places without Flock cameras, people are afraid to drop their kids off at school,” because of heightened immigration enforcement and the Trump administration’s policy change that lifted longstanding restrictions against immigration enforcement in or around schools and other “sensitive locations.”</p>

<h3>‘Can’t believe we have that here’</h3>
<p>For 16-year-old Zachary Schwartz, a high schooler from San Francisco, backlash to the Ring ad validated something he’s been telling people for months: Flock’s presence in communities nationwide has grown far too vast and most Americans don’t even realize it.</p>
<p>“You hear about tracking systems in other countries, like China, which are more authoritarian,” Schwartz said. “And it’s like, ‘Whoa, I can’t believe we have that here.”</p>
<p><a data-ylk="slk:Related;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://www.the74million.org/article/meet-the-gatekeepers-of-students-private-lives/">Related</a></p>
<h4>Meet the Gatekeepers of Students’ Private Lives</h4>
<p>Schwartz said he fell down the Flock rabbit hole after watching <a data-ylk="slk:YouTube videos about the technology;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp9MwZkHiMQ">YouTube videos about the technology</a>, which sent him digging into its widespread use in his own city. He learned the San Francisco Police Department shared its feeds with law enforcement officers nationwide, including for immigration enforcement, in apparent <a data-ylk="slk:violation of several California laws;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://sfstandard.com/2025/09/08/sfpd-flock-alpr-ice-data-sharing/">violation of several California laws</a>. Activists have also elevated concerns about weak cybersecurity safeguards and faulty findings that <a data-ylk="slk:put “innocent citizens in danger.” ;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://deflocksf.org">put “innocent citizens in danger.” </a></p>
<p>Schwartz built a website, <a data-ylk="slk:DeFlockSF.org;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="http://deflocksf.org">DeFlockSF.org</a>, to drive attention to Flock’s presence. He also circulated posters across San Francisco urging residents to learn about the cameras constantly watching them.</p>
<p>“If you’re driving on a major roadway, you’re being tracked in the city,” Schwartz said. “It would be pretty hard to avoid it while going to school if you’re going by car or by a bus.”</p>

<p>The 74 reached out to 30 districts to learn more about how they use Flock and whether they’ve assessed how their data are shared. Few responded and almost all declined to comment. Several, including Indiana’s Center Grove Community School Corporation, said they ended their contracts with Flock without providing details about why.</p>
<p>One district that did respond was Minnetonka Public Schools, 12 miles southwest of Minneapolis, where the Trump administration’s mass deployment of immigration agents last month resulted in the fatal shooting of two citizens, closed Minneapolis Public Schools for two days and forced multiple districts in the Twin Cities area to offer remote learning for students too afraid to come to school.</p>

<h4>As ICE Targets Twin Cities Schools &amp; Bus Stops, Even Citizens Keep Kids Home</h4>
<p>District spokesperson JacQueline Getty said Minnetonka school officials use Flock license plate readers primarily to ensure people who have been banned from campus don’t trespass on school property. She didn’t elaborate on whether district Flock data are shared directly with outside law enforcement agencies or if their data have been leveraged to assist federal immigration agents.</p>
<p>“We cooperate with our local law enforcement department when there is a need to do so, such as if our reader pings a stolen vehicle entering our lot,” Getty said in an email. “Our primary goal is campus safety, and the district has benefited from identifying people who should not be on district property.”</p>
<p>At Indiana University in Bloomington, <a data-ylk="slk:some 400 demonstrators participated;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://www.idsnews.com/article/2026/01/bloomington-protest-ice-immigration-flock-cameras">some 400 demonstrators participated</a> in a January protest criticizing the city’s use of Flock license plate readers.

<h3>‘The future that we really want?’</h3>
<p>The controversy comes on the heels of efforts at Flock to<a data-ylk="slk:more fully integrate its services into K-12 school;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://therecord.media/flock-safety-raptor-technologies-schools-surveillance"> more fully integrate its services into K-12 school</a> security. Security vendor Raptor Technologies announced last year an initiative to implement Flock cameras into a product designed to enhance safety during afternoon dismissal.</p>
<p>Raptor Technologies, which counts roughly 40% of U.S. school districts as its customers, offers software that screens school visitors.</p>
<p>“By working with both schools and local law enforcement, Flock helps create safe corridors for student travel — whether that’s monitoring activity along walking routes, at bus stops or on nearby roads,” Flock said in <a data-ylk="slk:a blog post touting the partnership;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://www.flocksafety.com/blog/5-ways-flock-safety-is-transforming-school-campus-safety----starting-with-a-smarter-dismissal-line">a blog post touting the partnership</a>.</p>

<h4>Leaked Active School Shooter Plans Revive Scrutiny of Ed Tech Privacy Pledge</h4>
<p>In 2024, <a data-ylk="slk:Raptor suffered a cybersecurity lapse;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://www.the74million.org/article/leaked-active-school-shooter-plans-revive-scrutiny-of-ed-tech-privacy-pledge-2/">Raptor suffered a cybersecurity lapse</a> that exposed millions of sensitive records — including districts’ active-shooter plans and students’ medical records — to the internet. The company didn’t respond to requests for comment.</p>
<p>Schwartz, the San Francisco high schooler, said students learn about mass surveillance at school by reading books like George Orwell’s classic <em>1984. </em>Yet when government overreach “happens right in front of us,” he said, “many people don’t see it.”</p>
<p>In a place where Bay Area technology companies routinely roll out their latest wares, people are starting to wake up, he said.</p>
<p>“It also means that we see the future before it happens sometimes,” Schwartz said, “and we can decide ‘Oh, is this the future that we really want?’”</p>
