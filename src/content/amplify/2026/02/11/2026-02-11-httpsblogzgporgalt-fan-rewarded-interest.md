title: Rewarded Interest fan post
---
<p>I said I was going to write a <a href="https://www.rewardedinterest.com/">Rewarded Interest</a> fan post, so here it is. Rewarded Interest is a Google Chrome extension that does some useful stuff.</p>
<ul> <li><p>Automate consent preferences</p></li> <li><p>Earn rewards</p></li> <li><p>Get personalized ads</p></li> </ul>
<p>Personalized ads? Yes. Privacy nerds and adtech people have strong opinions about whether people prefer personalized ads to purely contextual ads, and most of those opinions are wrong. There is no one “what the users want” on this issue. Research consistently shows that <a href="https://blog.zgp.org/30-40-30/">some people want personalized ads, and are willing to share personal info to get them, while other people don’t</a>. A single satisfactory default is impossible. It’s like <a href="https://tedium.co/2021/12/29/natural-scrolling-history/">“Natural Scrolling”</a> on a touchpad. Some people expect it to work one direction, some people expect it to work the other direction, and even though developers would certainly want to make it work just one way and only have to maintain one version, they have to offer a choice.</p>
<p>I’m a Rewarded Interest fan even though I’m not their target user. Personally, I have done enough overthinking of the issue that I now consider personalized advertising to be a <a href="https://blog.zgp.org/advertising-personalization-good-for-you/">risk to individuals and a blight on the economy</a>, and I think we’d be better off on average if personalizing ads was just <a href="https://blog.zgp.org/banning-surveillance-advertising/">banned</a>. But not everyone thinks like I do. If you post about these issues often enough there will always be some guy in the comment section who is all like, <em>if the ads weren’t accurately personalized to me I would get maxipad ads</em> <em>and I really don’t want that.</em> There is a subset of people who actually want whatever ads they get to be personalized. The challenge is how to give those people what they want while imposing as little cost and risk on everybody else.</p>
<p>And Rewarded Interest has figured it out. Rewarded Interest enables Google Chrome users to pass an identifier, using the <a href="https://www.iab.com/guidelines/openrtb/">OpenRTB</a> industry standard, in a way that works like an old-fashioned third-party cookie, but is stable and doesn’t require <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cookie_syncing">“cookie syncs”</a> and other overhead. And because Rewarded Interest is compatible with all the adtech companies already using OpenRTB, it enables web publishers to get better remuneration for the ads on their sites and doesn’t raise antitrust issues. Best of all, a person who doesn’t deliberately install Rewarded Interest isn’t affected, and a person who changes their mind (like if they think they’re getting <a href="https://blog.zgp.org/price-of-price-discrimination/">higher prices</a> along with the higher-end ads) can remove Rewarded Interest easily.</p>
<p>Rewarded Interest may be the first example of cross-context ad personalization that isn’t based on hiding or misrepresenting the tracking system, or badgering people into it. In a way, it’s a thing of beauty. People who want it can install it and, in effect, say, “here’s my code, scan me!” I used to ask adtech fans, if people like personalized ads so much, why are there so many privacy extensions and no extensions to make you <em>more</em> trackable online? And now I can stop asking that, because here it is.</p>
<p>One piece of customer research that doesn’t get done enough is trying to figure out if your target customers are privacy people or personalizers. As more brands figure it out, some marketers will likely decide to use Rewarded Interest as the right tool for reaching their intended audience, and some won’t. If we learned anything from the whole <a href="https://blog.zgp.org/google-privacy-sandbox-timeline/">Google “Privacy Sandbox” saga</a> it’s that trying to come up with one system for everyone will turn out too creepy for the privacy people and too noisy for the personalizers.</p>
<p>Anyway, I’m probably not going to be a regular user of Rewarded Interest, but I will keep in a Google Chrome profile to play around with. Sometimes you need a cigar bar for the the cigar aficionados and a no-smoking area for those who don’t want the smoke—trying to get both groups to start vaping will make nobody happy.</p>

According to analysis from HimTheDev, developers cite performance issues, workflow friction, and the growing dominance of cloud-native development as primary drivers. The article documents how Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), initially created as a bridge to keep developers on Windows, has paradoxically become a gateway drug to full Linux adoption.</p>
