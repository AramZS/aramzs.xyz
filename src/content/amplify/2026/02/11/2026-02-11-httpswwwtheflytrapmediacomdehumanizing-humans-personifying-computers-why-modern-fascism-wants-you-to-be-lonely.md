<p>I keep thinking about the ICE agent who was <a href="https://youtu.be/W1dyNcRGRXY?si=Z0mt1Qlbs8CS2R06&amp;t=89&amp;ref=theflytrapmedia.com"><u>caught on tape</u></a> last month wondering aloud to a horde of his fellow goons: “It’s just like ‘Call of Duty.’” He says this almost cheerily, while wielding a weapon of war in the streets of Minneapolis. This odious and cowardly fucko, gunned up and masked, terrorizing the people of Minnesota—though, I guess in his view, Minnesotans aren’t people at all. Just a bunch of random NPCs. Fodder for the fascist high score.</p>
<p>I also keep thinking about the Nvidia shill—sorry, <em>ahemm</em>, the company’s ”global head of generative AI for automotive”—<a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91470644/ces-2026-cars-companions-nvidia-bosch?ref=theflytrapmedia.com"><u>inviting attendees</u></a> of the CES 2026 tech conference to “think of the car as having a soul and being an extension of your family.” Souls for cars with computers! Am I losing my mind? Do I even have one? Am I committing automotive abuse if I don’t tuck mine in each night and read it a bedtime story?</p>
<p><em>And</em> I keep thinking of the growing anti-abortion efforts to <a href="https://www.rounds.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/rounds-introduces-the-life-at-conception-act?ref=theflytrapmedia.com"><u>grant constitutional rights</u></a> to zygotes, embryos, and fetuses. Such proposals pave the way for the prosecution of people who have abortions—an explicit policy goal of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2025/apr/23/anti-abortion-fetal-personhood?ref=theflytrapmedia.com"><u>anti-abortion “abolitionist” faction</u></a> and one that’s becoming increasingly palatable <a href="https://reproaction.org/mainstream-pro-life-leaders-admit-pro-criminalization/?ref=theflytrapmedia.com"><u>among mainline “pro-life” leaders</u></a>. The anti-abortion lobby calls this “equal protection” or “fetal personhood,” and it demands that pregnant people relinquish their own human right to reproductive self-determination.</p>
