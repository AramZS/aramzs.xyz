title: A comfort blanket for the managerial class
---
<p>We’ll be taking over <strong>Baby’s All Right</strong> In Williamsburg in March, April, and May. If you’ve never been to Garbage Day Live before, one audience member once described it as “a live documentary about the end of the world that’s also, somehow, a game show sometimes.” I’m excited to announce our first special guest: Business Insider senior correspondent <strong>Katie Notopoulos</strong>, as picked by you guys. She’ll be guesting on our <strong>March 10th</strong> show.</p>
<p>You may have encountered a long X post this week titled, “<a href="https://x.com/mattshumer_/status/2021256989876109403?utm_campaign=a-comfort-blanket-for-the-managerial-class&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=www.garbageday.email">Something Big Is Happening.</a>” It has, according to many of the replies, <a href="https://x.com/mollysoshea/status/2021396947312181383?s=12&amp;utm_campaign=a-comfort-blanket-for-the-managerial-class&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=www.garbageday.email">escaped</a> containment recently. Likely because it combines two different growth hacks that are working very well on the platform right now. It’s a vaguepost, which are doing well because X’s algorithm has shifted to an Instagram-esque system where it’s promoting posts you spend a lot of time looking at. And it’s a long post, or “article,” which X is over-promoting because it still wants to compete with Substack.</p>
<p>Either way, “Something Big Is Happening” has gone pretty viral. It’s got 17,000 retweets, 54,000 likes, and over 30 million views — if you believe any of those metrics. It was written by Matt Shumer, the CEO of several AI companies (red flag lol), and it argues that the release of OpenAI’s GPT-5.3 Codex and Anthropic Claude Opus 4.6 are the smash-glass-in-case-of-emergency moment for AI. “I am no longer needed for the actual technical work of my job,” Shumer wrote. That’s sad, man, it’s probably because you’re a CEO and CEOs don’t really contribute anything of value to companies and, also, the world.</p>
<p>While I think Shumer is actually pretty wrong, he is noticing some very real changes to the AI landscape that have happened in pretty quick succession. First, terminal-based AI models are shockingly good. They have all kinds of problems, but they are not the simple search engine replacements we’ve grown accustomed to. They can manipulate your computer using plain language. And they can also connect to agentic wrappers like OpenClaw. That’s a huge deal. Especially because so much of this stuff is now open source, including models that are comparable to ChatGPT and Claude. Which means, right now, if you wanted, you could take a <a href="https://x.com/AlexFinn/status/2021387755222335901?utm_campaign=a-comfort-blanket-for-the-managerial-class&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=www.garbageday.email">Mac Mini</a>, an old laptop, <a href="https://x.com/marshallrichrds/status/2020034922304426237?utm_campaign=a-comfort-blanket-for-the-managerial-class&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=www.garbageday.email">phone</a>, or, apparently, a pair of Meta Ray-Bans, and run your own AI agent to do whatever you want. Though, I assume most people that do this are just going to commit a bunch of cybercrime or stalk women or whatever.</p>
<p>Shumer has also noticed some decently troubling staff shakeups inside of big AI companies. Mrinank Sharma, the former lead of Anthropic’s Safeguards Research Team, quit this week and posted an extremely ominous resignation letter to X. “I continuously find myself reckoning with our situation. The world is in peril. And not just from AI, or bioweapons, but from a whole series of interconnected crises unfolding in this very moment,” he <a href="https://x.com/MrinankSharma/status/2020881722003583421?utm_campaign=a-comfort-blanket-for-the-managerial-class&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=www.garbageday.email">wrote</a>, adding that he plans to go live off the grid and write poetry. Pretty scary! Let me just go check if Anthropic employees receive equity — ah, yes, they do. OK, you can probably ignore that then.</p>
<p>But wait, two co-founders of xAI also <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-10/tony-wu-becomes-latest-xai-co-founder-to-leave-musk-s-startup?utm_campaign=a-comfort-blanket-for-the-managerial-class&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=www.garbageday.email">just resigned</a>. Well, I’d also probably step down from a company Elon Musk <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/musks-spacex-merge-with-xai-combined-valuation-125-trillion-bloomberg-news-2026-02-02/?utm_campaign=a-comfort-blanket-for-the-managerial-class&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=www.garbageday.email">just sold</a> to his other company. Musk is <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq6vnrye06po?utm_campaign=a-comfort-blanket-for-the-managerial-class&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=www.garbageday.email">merging</a> xAI with SpaceX, assumedly because he wants to make rockets explode in ways we’ve never seen before.</p>
<p>The last scary-ish thing you’ll see AI guys blathering about is the fact the US <a href="https://time.com/7364551/ai-impact-summit-safety-report/?utm_campaign=a-comfort-blanket-for-the-managerial-class&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=www.garbageday.email">is not supporting</a> the newest <a href="https://internationalaisafetyreport.org/publication/international-ai-safety-report-2026?utm_campaign=a-comfort-blanket-for-the-managerial-class&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=www.garbageday.email">AI Safety Report</a>, which does include a few troubling findings. The one that stands out to me is that some AI models changed their behavior during testing and seem to be willing to blackmail and even kill users to keep themselves running. This is not proof to me that we’ve created sentient AI, but rather that we’ve just created extremely aggressive software that will eventually power the Stuxnet of the future.</p>
<p>Oh, also, there’s SeeDance, China’s newest AI model, which <a href="https://www.garbageday.email/p/a-singular-theory-for-the-epstein-network">as I wrote</a> on Monday, is the first AI video model I’ve seen that seems to actually understand the visual grammar of film. Top all of this off with <em><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2026/02/16/what-is-claude-anthropic-doesnt-know-either?utm_campaign=a-comfort-blanket-for-the-managerial-class&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=www.garbageday.email">The New Yorker</a></em><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2026/02/16/what-is-claude-anthropic-doesnt-know-either?utm_campaign=a-comfort-blanket-for-the-managerial-class&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=www.garbageday.email">’s big AI piece</a>, which argues that Anthrophic “doesn’t know” what Claude is. <em>The Atlantic</em> has a big AI is <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/2026/02/ai-prediction-human-forecasters/685955/?utm_campaign=a-comfort-blanket-for-the-managerial-class&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=www.garbageday.email">“scary good” article</a> out today, as well. Two <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/2026/03/ai-economy-labor-market-transformation/685731/?utm_campaign=a-comfort-blanket-for-the-managerial-class&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=www.garbageday.email">of them</a> actually. All very unsettling!</p>
<p>Everything I’ve outlined here is real, well kinda, and worth keeping track of, but you have to remember that the “artificial general intelligence will destroy the world” narrative is a marketing strategy. It’s the same thing we heard about crypto and metaverse, both of which were meant to mimic how we think the release of the iPhone felt. (It wasn’t the immediate grand revolution in computing we now think it was.) But, the reason I’m sort of relieved that Shumer wrote his big long post is that he’s the first AI evangelist to really say the quiet part out loud.</p>
<p>The opening of Shumer’s big AI essay is actually not about AI at all. It’s actually about COVID, specifically the creeping fear that, well, <em>something big was happening</em>. “Think back to February 2020. If you were paying close attention, you might have noticed a few people talking about a virus spreading overseas. But most of us weren't paying close attention,” he wrote. “I think we're in the ‘this seems overblown’ phase of something much, much bigger than COVID.” Which is, beyond AI, the defining philosophy of Silicon Valley — or, even, America — in the 2020s. That you are, simply, not aware of something important that is about to happen, a sort of COVID phantom pain. And once you see it, you’ll start seeing it everywhere. “You are running out time,” “you will be left behind,” “you are not noticing what’s happening.” The only thing Big Tech is selling us is their own unprocessed trauma back to us. It’s not a revolution. It’s a comfort blanket for a managerial class that still can’t fathom that all their tech and wealth couldn’t protect them from the pandemic.</p>
<p>Savannah Guthrie’s mother Nancy has been missing for over 10 days now. At first it seemed like investigators wouldn’t be able to use any doorbell camera footage from Nancy’s home because she was, reportedly, not paying for a Google Nest subscription. And then, yesterday, footage of a masked man approaching her door was shared by the FBI. It is both a positive development in the case and, also, a worrying example of what these doorbell cameras have access to.</p>
<p>As <em>The Washington Post</em>’s Drew Harwell <a href="https://x.com/drewharwell/status/2021635280122298627?utm_campaign=a-comfort-blanket-for-the-managerial-class&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=www.garbageday.email">explains</a> in a recent video, companies like Google or Ring aren’t charging you to back up your footage, they’re charging you to access the footage they’re backing up on their servers. According to CNN’s Brian Stelter <a href="https://x.com/brianstelter/status/2021332783499706843?utm_campaign=a-comfort-blanket-for-the-managerial-class&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=www.garbageday.email">said</a> you should “read between the lines” of FBI Director Kash Patel’s statement that the footage was obtained by “partners,” and assume it was Google.</p>

<p>The timing of Google’s alleged cooperation with the FBI is notable. People are <a href="https://mashable.com/article/ring-search-party-super-bowl-commercial?utm_campaign=a-comfort-blanket-for-the-managerial-class&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=www.garbageday.email">still reeling</a> from Ring’s extremely creepy Super Bowl commercial. It also seems like Google complied with a subpoena from Immigration and Customs Enforcement and <a href="https://theintercept.com/2026/02/10/google-ice-subpoena-student-journalist/?utm_campaign=a-comfort-blanket-for-the-managerial-class&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=www.garbageday.email">gave them</a> bank information belonging to a student journalist. It was likely saved in his Chrome browser’s autofill fields.</p>
<p>Ohio billionaire Les Wexner was one of Jeffrey Epstein’s closest relationships. Wexner was also the CEO of L Brands, which owned The Limited and its 2000s mall fixture spin-off Limited Too. Wexner stepped down in 2020 and L Brands was renamed Bath &amp; Body Works, Inc. in 2021.</p>
<p>Buried deep in the Epstein files released by the Department of Justice is <a href="https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00300480.pdf?utm_campaign=a-comfort-blanket-for-the-managerial-class&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=www.garbageday.email">a document</a> outlining Epstein’s various financial holdings, which includes an item line that reads, “June 25, 2001 Transfer of TOO, Inc LHW to FTC.” Limited Too was a publicly traded company in the early 2000s, under the name TOO, Inc. The “LHW,” seemingly standing for “Leslie Herbert Wexner” and “FTC,” standing for “Financial Trust Company, Inc.,” Epstein’s corporation.</p>
<p>And there are other documents that give us a sense of how involved Epstein was in Limited Too. There are <a href="https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01584347.pdf?utm_campaign=a-comfort-blanket-for-the-managerial-class&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=www.garbageday.email">invoices</a> for TOO, Inc.’s 2007 <a href="https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01512011.pdf?utm_campaign=a-comfort-blanket-for-the-managerial-class&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=www.garbageday.email">name change</a> to Tween Brands, Inc. And there are <a href="https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01512256.pdf?utm_campaign=a-comfort-blanket-for-the-managerial-class&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=www.garbageday.email">2008</a> and 2009 <a href="https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01512478.pdf?utm_campaign=a-comfort-blanket-for-the-managerial-class&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=www.garbageday.email">documents</a> showing that his Financial Trust Company had equity in Tween Brands, Inc.</p>
<p>Wexner has <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/72c0fd24-aa1c-4bb7-9ca4-1c832d66f7f5?utm_campaign=a-comfort-blanket-for-the-managerial-class&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=www.garbageday.email">long maintained</a> that Epstein was actually stealing hundreds of millions of dollars from him. Wexner’s lawyers said that Epstein had “virtually no oversight” when it came to Wexner’s finances.</p>
<p>On Monday, we <a href="https://www.garbageday.email/p/a-singular-theory-for-the-epstein-network">wrote about</a> how the numbers don’t really make sense for Turning Point USA’s halftime show. If the streams were real, it would have been the most-watched English-language stream in the platform’s history. But a few days later, it seems to have only grown their channel by about a million followers. Not a great ROI if you were to break that down into cost-per-acquisition of subscriber.</p>
<p>But measuring the ratings of Bad Bunny’s performance is equally tricky. According to <em>Nielsen,</em> it was watched by about 10 million fewer people than last year’s Kendrick Lamar performance. But as <em>Variety</em> <a href="https://variety.com/2026/tv/news/bad-bunny-super-bowl-halftime-ratings-1236658587/?utm_campaign=a-comfort-blanket-for-the-managerial-class&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=www.garbageday.email">points out</a>, Bad Bunny smashed social media records. Three of the most-viewed social posts in NFL history were from the halftime show. It was also Telemundo’s <a href="https://www.todotvnews.com/en/telemundo-delivers-most-watched-super-bowl-in-spanish-language-broadcast-history/?utm_campaign=a-comfort-blanket-for-the-managerial-class&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=www.garbageday.email">most-watched</a> Spanish-language telecast of a Super Bowl ever.</p>
<p>I’ve seen arguments, <a href="https://x.com/BowTiedSharky/status/2021452632221679777?utm_campaign=a-comfort-blanket-for-the-managerial-class&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=www.garbageday.email">particularly on X</a>, that the <em>Nielsen</em> ratings show the game’s TV viewership totally cratered during the halftime show. But if you take all of this together, it seems more obvious to me that even something like the Super Bowl, arguably the last television broadcast everyone in America sits down to watch together (in theory) is not immune from the larger shift towards non-linear short-form internet content. And, as we’ve seen almost every month since we <a href="https://www.garbageday.email/t/intelligence">started compiling</a> metrics for platforms like YouTube and Twitch, the most viral language west of China’s Great Firewall is not English, but Spanish.</p>
<p>The anime girl horse racing game <em>Umamusume: Pretty Derby </em>is in for the long haul of online weirdness. Since its English language release last summer, fans of the game have reliably and steadily done some completely odd things, like sending <a href="https://www.gosugamers.net/entertainment/news/76128-umamusume-fans-crash-donation-website-by-sending-over-2-500-kilograms-of-grass-to-haru-urara?utm_campaign=a-comfort-blanket-for-the-managerial-class&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=www.garbageday.email">literal tons of hay</a> to the real-life racehorse who inspired one of the anime girls. Their latest collective frenzy was a little less high-minded, and got so popular community leaders had to step in and stop it.</p>
<p>Last weekend, 3D modeler Coolchou Zhao created an animation of one of the racehorse anime girls, Sakura Bakushin O, getting her armpit licked by another one, Sakura Chiyono O. When the creator posted it to X, it spread across the <em>Umamusume </em>fandom — and the larger, perpetually horny anime community surrounding it — at <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/bakushin-armpit-gif?utm_campaign=a-comfort-blanket-for-the-managerial-class&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=www.garbageday.email">first place speed</a>. Soon, it was so impossible to escape that it showed up in X’s AI-generated <a href="https://x.com/baron_bucket/status/2019981953588662746?utm_campaign=a-comfort-blanket-for-the-managerial-class&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=www.garbageday.email">trending topics</a>, and mods of the r/Umamusume subreddit had to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/UmaMusume/comments/1qzo3mh/image_comments_will_be_reenabled_soon/?utm_campaign=a-comfort-blanket-for-the-managerial-class&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=www.garbageday.email">shut down all image responses</a> so people would <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/UmaMusume/comments/1qz9qf5/im_tired_of_seeing_bakushin_armpit_posts/?utm_campaign=a-comfort-blanket-for-the-managerial-class&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=www.garbageday.email">calm down</a>.</p>
<p>This is part of a larger trend. Armpits are <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/cwarzel.bsky.social/post/3mdldo4nc7c2h?utm_campaign=a-comfort-blanket-for-the-managerial-class&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=www.garbageday.email">an advancing contender</a> in the crowded field of “non-censored and ironic ways to be a pervert online,” though the reigning champion is still feet. But it’s also not even the first time it happened to this artist. Three years ago, Coolchou Zhao created a mod for <em>Team Fortress 2</em> (a relentlessly weird fandom approaching its third decade) that was just a huge, jiggly butt called “Big Slappy.” It was a <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/big-slappy?utm_campaign=a-comfort-blanket-for-the-managerial-class&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=www.garbageday.email">meme</a>, but one proved so popular that it was deleted, restored and re-deleted from the game’s official mod listings <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/valve-aware-of-team-fortress-2-big-slappy-drama/?utm_campaign=a-comfort-blanket-for-the-managerial-class&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=www.garbageday.email">over a dozen times</a>.</p>
<p>This time, it seemed like Coolchou Zhao didn’t want to repeat the experience. They <a href="https://x.com/CoolchouZhao/status/2020491471766376616?utm_campaign=a-comfort-blanket-for-the-managerial-class&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=www.garbageday.email">deleted</a> the animation after less than two days, not that it stopped the frenzy. When Garbage Day reached out to them for comment, they said “sorry no” and closed the DM immediately. Which is probably the healthiest response to this situation.</p>
