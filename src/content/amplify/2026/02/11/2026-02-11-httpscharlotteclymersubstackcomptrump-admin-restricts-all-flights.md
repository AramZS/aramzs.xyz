<p>Late last night, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued a restriction on all air travel over El Paso, Texas for the next ten days, citing “special security reasons” but no further explanation.</p>
<p>The notice went into effect at 11:30pm local time and will expire at 11:30pm on Feb. 20th.</p>
<p>The air restriction extends out in a ten mile radius from El Paso, the nation’s 22nd-largest city by population and home to El Paso International Airport, which handles about four million travelers annually.</p>
<p>No flights going in or out for ten days. There has not been an air space restriction of this magnitude in the United States since 9/11.</p>
<p>Local officials were reportedly not notified beforehand.</p>
<p>El Paso City Councilmember Chris Canales wrote this from his Reddit account about four hours ago:</p>
<blockquote><p>Hi y’all. This is real, but [no] reason at all to panic. We’re all trying to work out why this crazy NOTAM was issued by the FAA. What I know so far (as of 12:56 AM local time Wednesday):</p><p>• It isn’t a typo or an error. FAA issued this NOTAM intentionally as written.</p><p>• Nobody local got advance notice — neither civilian nor military leadership.</p><p>• Military does not have carte blanche exemption. Army seems to be fretting about their flights tomorrow just as much as everyone else.</p><p>• Local air traffic controllers didn’t get advance notice.</p><p>• Albuquerque Center (regional air traffic controllers) also did not get advance notice.</p><p>I’ll share more updates here as I’m able.</p></blockquote>
<p>Folks, I don’t need to tell y’all this is extremely rare and definitely cause for concern.</p>
<p>Shutting down a major airport with no notice to local civilian and military leadership for an extended period is a flashing red light that something ridiculous from the Trump administration is about to happen.</p>
<p>At this hour, I don’t pretend to be 100% certain what that is, but my best guess is that Trump is about to announce major military operations against Mexican drug cartels on Mexican soil.</p>
<p>El Paso is also home to Fort Bliss, the U.S. Army base that serves as the headquarters for the 1st Armored Division and Joint Task Force North (or JTF-North).</p>
<p>JFT-North is the Department of Defense organization “tasked to support our nation’s federal law enforcement agencies in the identification and interdiction of suspected criminal activities conducted within and along the approaches to the continental United States.”</p>
<p>In other words, the focus of JTF-North in this moment is focussed on assisting in operations against drug cartels and terrorism.</p>
<p>Just across the border from El Paso is Juárez, one of the biggest cities in Mexico, which has been the source of cartel activity for decades. At least three major criminal organizations are associated with the city: the Juárez Cartel, the Sinaloa Cartel, and the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (JNGC).</p>
<p>While Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has offered limited and conditional cooperation with Trump since he took office (including extradition of cartel leaders to the U.S. for prosecution, which, in itself, was a major concession), she has flatly (and rightly) rejected U.S. military intervention on Mexican soil.</p>
<p>About a month ago, President Sheinbaum <strong><a href="https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260112-us-troops-mexico-not-on-the-table-sheinbaum-trump">confirmed</a></strong> she had a conversation with Trump in which she told him that deployment of the U.S. military is “not on the table” despite him repeatedly pushing her to allow operations.</p>
<p>President Sheinbaum also pointed out the significant progress that has been made in curbing cartel activity, noting that fentanyl trafficking from Mexico to the U.S. has fallen by 50 percent in the past year.</p>
<p>So, what is this all about? Why close down a major American airport with no warning?</p>
<p>It’s about the Epstein Files. It’s a distraction. The information coming out of the 3.5 million pages released by Trump’s DOJ two weeks ago gets more horrific by the day, even with all of the (illegal) redactions ordered by Trump and Pam Bondi.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Rep. Jamie Raskin raised eyebrows when he said that while being permitted to review the un-redacted version of the Files that have already been released, Trump’s name was mentioned “more than a million times.”</p>
<p>To put that in better context, the figure that’s been cited for the redacted version of the Files has been about 38,000 mentions of Trump’s name. If Congressman Raskin is right, that would mean his name is found 26x more in the un-redaction version of the released files.</p>
<p>Mind you, that’s only the 3.5 million pages released, so far. That doesn’t include the other three million pages still being held by Trump’s DOJ.</p>
<p>Trump’s ongoing and frantic shield strategy against the public outrage over his connection with Epstein has not worked. He’s completely failing to get the country to move on from this.</p>
<p>So, what better distraction when the water is at its hottest than to rally his base with military operations that violate Mexican sovereignty?</p>
<p>The El Paso story is still developing, but I believe that’s where this is going. I believe that’s the play Trump is making.</p>
<p>He is so desperate and mentally unstable right now that he would risk a war with Mexico in order to distract all of us from his role in a massive sex trafficking operation that targeted children.</p>
<p>God help us.</p>
