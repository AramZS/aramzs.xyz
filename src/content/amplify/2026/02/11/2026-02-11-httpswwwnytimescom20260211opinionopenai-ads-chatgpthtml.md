<p><i><p><i>By </i>Zoë Hitzig</p><blockquote><p>Ms. Hitzig is a former researcher at OpenAI.</p></blockquote></i></p>
<p>This week, OpenAI started testing ads on <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/09/sam-altman-touts-chatgpt-growth-as-openai-nears-100-billion-funding.html">ChatGPT</a>. I also resigned from the company after spending two years as a researcher helping to shape how A.I. models were built and priced, and guiding early safety policies before standards were set in stone.</p>
<p>I once believed I could help the people building A.I. get ahead of the problems it would create. This week confirmed my slow realization that OpenAI seems to have stopped asking the questions I’d joined to help answer.</p>
<p>I don’t believe ads are immoral or unethical. A.I. is expensive to run, and ads can be a critical source of revenue. But I have deep reservations about OpenAI’s strategy.</p>
<p>For several years, ChatGPT users have generated an archive of human candor that has no precedent, in part because people believed they were talking to something that had no ulterior agenda. Users are interacting with an adaptive, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-025-02194-6">conversational voice</a> to which they have revealed their most private thoughts. People tell chatbots about their medical fears, their relationship problems, their beliefs about God and the afterlife. Advertising built on that archive creates a potential for manipulating users in ways we don’t have the tools to understand, let alone prevent.</p>
<p>Many people frame the problem of funding A.I. as choosing the lesser of two evils: restrict access to transformative technology to a select group of people wealthy enough to pay for it, or accept advertisements even if it means exploiting users’ deepest fears and desires to sell them a product. I believe that’s a false choice. Tech companies can pursue options that could keep these tools broadly available while limiting any company’s incentives to surveil, profile and manipulate its users.</p>
<p>OpenAI says it will adhere to <a href="https://openai.com/index/our-approach-to-advertising-and-expanding-access/">principles</a> for running ads on ChatGPT: The ads will be clearly labeled, appear at the bottom of answers and will not influence responses. I believe the first iteration of ads will probably follow those principles. But I’m worried subsequent iterations won’t, because the company is building an economic engine that creates strong incentives to override its own rules. (The New York Times has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/27/business/media/new-york-times-open-ai-microsoft-lawsuit.html">sued</a> OpenAI for copyright infringement of news content related to A.I. systems. OpenAI has denied those claims.)</p>
