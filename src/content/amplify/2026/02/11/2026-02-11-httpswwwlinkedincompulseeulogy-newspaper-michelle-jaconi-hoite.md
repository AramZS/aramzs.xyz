<p>Washington has not felt this sad since Tim Russert’s funeral.</p>
<p>The mix of shock and grief that segues into fear that an entire country has lost its mooring.</p>
<p>I remember looking around Tim’s funeral feeling the change palpitate through the city: there was a new license to behave badly since the nation’s singular symbol of goodness was gone. Tim was a lot like The Washington Post – a convening agent, a lovable storyteller who always remembered the little guy – especially as Tim himself rose in power.</p>
<p>In fact, Tim nurtured a small staff that he trained and encouraged to remember the vulnerable and voiceless. Not because he was told to, but because he never wanted to lose his compass. I was part of that compass, always helping him use a “Big Russ Test” – a rubric for every decision and every word Tim used to make sure it made sense to Tim’s dad in Buffalo -- a veteran, a patriot, and a trash man.</p>
<p>I thought about Big Russ Wednesday morning as I and hundreds of public servants dutifully waited by our laptops to get an email with a subject line, “Eliminated.” In a company built around diction, the word stung with callousness. It also marked another tectonic shift in the DNA of Washington, D.C. – the home to more wealth, education, and possibility than perhaps any city in the world. How would I explain that to Big Russ? Or my own dad, Big Joe?</p>
<p>I would have to tell them the day's headline in simple terms:</p>
<p>The singular family-owned institution in America’s capital with the mission to care about people and serve its community had stopped doing both.</p>
<p>One spring I took my family to Universal in Orlando and made a game of counting newspapers: the Daily Prophet, the Daily Planet, the Daily Bugle; they were everywhere. The central glue in decades of stories. When I asked my son why there were so many newspapers in an amusement park, he answered simply, “it’s where superheroes work.”</p>
<p>I laughed. I told him that I did in fact work with a lot of superheroes at The Post, and that they were mostly like the Avengers, a bunch of misfits with superhuman strengths who didn’t belong anywhere else because their sense of justice was too strong for any other business to tolerate. I painted a picture for him of our newsroom – with its wide open-seating plan that bred both competition and collective excellence. I told him that just like Iron Man watches out for Spider-Man in Infinity War, Karen Tumulty watched out for me, Ashley Parker and Hannah Natanson in our own times of trial.</p>
<p>What I didn’t tell my son was that he would most likely grow up without a Hall of Justice – destined to be raised on the isolated narcissism of the creator economy instead of living with a congealing agent of shared public good.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Zoeann Murphy was on the National Mall on January 6th, 2021. I was in the control room at the Post with her camera piped into my headset. “Are you safe?” I asked in her earpiece as she walked through the mob to get a better shot of the U.S. Capitol. Zoeann was walking backwards and simultaneously narrating to us what was happening (newspaper people are a scrappy bunch). All of the sudden, Zoeann stopped mid-sentence and addressed us and the millions of viewers watching live on the homepage of the Washington Post and YouTube, “Guys – Guys I am so sorry I am going to have to go, we are being arrested.”</p>
<p>I, aghast, jumped back in Zoe’s ear and said, “Stay on air. Ask the officer what are the charges.” Whitney Leaming re-focused the camera on Zoeann, who was calmly looking at the police officer, who somehow was ignoring the violent mob and concentrating his authority on two female Post reporters. Zoe asked him politely, “Excuse me, can you please tell me the charges you are arresting me with?” The police officer clenched his jaw. He conferred with another officer. Seconds ticked. The control room was silent.</p>
<p>Whitney and Zoe were detained and put in “the kettle” – where the police had roped up some armed protesters. My colleagues were patted down and about to be cuffed when Marty Baron called the Chief of Police on their behalf. They were released and they came back to the Post and walked into the control room. We stood up, headsets still on, hands still typing, but verbally cheering for the First Amendment. A nice win on a heart-breaking day.</p>
<p>This week we are witnessing the opposite. A slow-motion retreat from even attempting to raise an engaged citizenry. Newspapers have never been just about the “news” – they have been a soulful product that ties you with your neighbor – whether that be the arts, sports, weather, horoscopes, the crossword or a comic strip. They gave you that moment in the day that reminded you of something other than yourself. A shared habit around something bigger; a binding agent that pulled disparate people into a shared story.</p>
<p>In Washington, D.C., a place that attracts ego and mission in equal ferocity, a sublimation of one’s self is a necessary function.</p>
<p>In a world where fewer people go to religious services of any kind, newspapers are one of the only ways we can teach people to care about their impact on nature and on each other.</p>
<p>My favorite part of Tim’s office was a sign that read, “Thou Shalt Not Whine.” I am not here to lament a business decision. I am here to ask for help in building a better one.</p>
