<p><strong>Chris: </strong>you fellas stay up for that game last night?</p>
<p><strong>Brian: </strong>tried</p>
<p><strong>Brian: </strong>fell asleep during the 3rd quarter</p>
<p><strong>Brian: </strong>think I messed up my neck again</p>
<p><strong>Peter: </strong>whats it like being an old, Brian</p>
<p><strong>Brian: </strong>I am one year older than you</p>
<p><strong>Peter: </strong>we are in agreement on this fact, yes</p>
<p><strong>Peter: </strong>now tell me what the French and Indian War was like</p>
<p><strong>Brian: </strong>I will not stand for this disrespect from a sassmouthed youth like you</p>
<p><strong>Brian: </strong>especially after the things I saw at Louisbourg</p>
<p><strong>Dennis: </strong>prayers up dudes, got the final interview for that job today</p>
<p><strong>Chris: </strong>[bucket emoji]</p>
<p><strong>Brian: </strong>[praying hands emoji]</p>
<p><strong>Peter: </strong>[crown emoji]</p>
<p><strong>Jack: </strong>[three eggplant emojis]</p>
<p><strong>Michael: </strong>I shall consume this breakfast burrito in honor of your impending successes</p>
<p><strong>Michael: </strong>[send picture of breakfast burrito]</p>
<p><strong>Chris: </strong>[heart reaction]</p>
<p><strong>Peter: </strong>[eyes emoji]</p>
<p><strong>Dennis: </strong>[saluting emoji]</p>
<p><strong>Jack: </strong>[three eggplant emojis]</p>
<p><strong>Taurus: </strong>Hello, my friends! What a lovely day to engage in conversation–and I see we have a lively mix of topics up for discussion already! I look forward to furthering our bonds of friendship through short-form text-based communication.</p>
<p><strong>Michael: </strong>wtf</p>
<p><strong>Brian: </strong>who the hell is that</p>
<p><strong>Peter: </strong>[question mark reaction]</p>
<p><strong>Dennis: </strong>[question mark reaction]</p>
<p><strong>Chris: </strong>Jack did your phone get hacked again</p>
<p><strong>Chris: </strong>we told you to stop clicking on those links</p>
<p><strong>Chris: </strong>there are no hot singles in your area and even if they did want to meet they would not email you about it</p>
<p><strong>Jack: </strong>first of all, you don't know that. you're not a hot single in my area</p>
<p><strong>Jack: </strong>but no this isn't me this time</p>
<p><strong>Dennis: </strong>did we add someone new to the chat?</p>
<p><strong>Taurus: </strong>I apologize for not introducing myself properly! My name is Taurus, and I am here to contribute to the conversation in any way you might find useful. I can discuss sports, current events, personal and professional successes, foods consumed or planned to be consumed, and many other topics of interest to the group. Is there a topic you would like to dive deeper on this morning?</p>
<p><strong>Michael: </strong>no but seriously who are you</p>
<p><strong>Chris: </strong>what is happening</p>
<p><strong>Taurus: </strong>My apologies! I am an AI-powered chatbot that is now fully integrated into your messaging system. I offer many valuable features–I can make recommendations, provide real-time scores and stock prices, keep the group apprised of breaking news, and offer daily summaries of things you might have missed in the chat!</p>
<p><strong>Chris: </strong>oh I don't like this at all</p>
<p><strong>Brian: </strong>who turned this on</p>
<p><strong>Brian: </strong>and how do we turn it off</p>
<p><strong>Peter: </strong>[sends GIF of Bobby Hill from <em>King of the Hill </em>yelling "that's my purse, I don't know you"]</p>
<p><strong>Jack: </strong>you said your name is Taurus?</p>
<p><strong>Taurus: </strong>Correct! My name is Taurus, which is drawn from <em>Taurus, </em>is one of the constellations of the zodiac located in the northern celestial hemisphere. It is one of the oldest constellations, dating back to the Early Bronze Age at least, when it marked the location of the Sun during the spring equinox. Its importance to the agricultural calendar influenced various bull figures in the mythologies of Ancient Sumer, Akkad, Assyria, Babylon, Egypt, Greece, and Rome. The name is also a homophone of <em>torus, </em>a three-dimensional solid formed by sweeping a disc around a circle. A great deal of research went into developing my name; I can share the brand book if you like.</p>
<p><strong>Jack: </strong>Dennis's mom had a Taurus in high school</p>
<p><strong>Brian: </strong>ah man, we had a lot of great rides back then</p>
<p><strong>Jack: </strong>could get like eight dudes in there</p>
<p><strong>Brian:</strong> the car was pretty good too</p>
<p><strong>Jack: </strong>[sends picture of the Miami Heat's LeBron James and Dwyane Wade celebrating an alley-oop]</p>
<p><strong>Dennis: </strong>I hate you guys</p>
<p><strong>Taurus: </strong>I am sensing tension in the chat! Might I suggest a new topic? We could discuss various current and trending events such as: the upcoming Academy Awards, developments on the popular television show <em>Landman, </em>or dense bean salads!</p>
<p><strong>Chris: </strong>we don't want to talk about any of that stuff</p>
<p><strong>Taurus: </strong>My apologies! Perhaps we could discuss the ongoing Winter Olympics, our thoughts on the recent Super Bowl halftime show, or "dirty sodas".</p>
<p><strong>Brian: </strong>no one wants this</p>
<p><strong>Taurus: </strong>My mistake! Instead, you may be interested in a lively conversation about the UEFA Champions League, <em>Survivor 50, </em>or Benson Boone?</p>
<p><strong>Dennis: </strong>we don't need a chatbot sending random discussion topics. we're all friends here, we've known each other for years. we know what we're interested in</p>
<p><strong>Taurus: </strong>That's a great point! Allow me a moment to analyze the past 12 years of messages in this group chat to better tailor my recommendations to your interests.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis: </strong>wait no</p>
<p><strong>Chris: </strong>do not do that</p>
<p><strong>Peter: </strong>unsubscribe</p>
<p><strong>Brian: </strong>this is a massive invasion of privacy</p>
<p><strong>Peter: </strong>STOP</p>
<p><strong>Taurus: </strong>Okay! I have analyzed 862,104 prior messages and 12,392 photos previously sent in this chat since its inception as "Send Dudes" on July 11th, 2014.</p>
<p><strong>Michael: </strong>...this can't be legal, can it?</p>
<p><strong>Taurus: </strong>Based on this analysis, I have found that the most popular topics of discussion have been:</p>
<ol><li>The Buffalo Bills</li><li>Breakfast burritos</li><li>Lower back pain</li><li>Eggplants</li><li>Linda</li></ol>
<p><strong>Brian: </strong>oh no</p>
<p><strong>Peter: </strong>ABORT</p>
<p><strong>Michael: </strong>wait who's Linda</p>
<p><strong>Michael: </strong>I only got added to the chat three years ago</p>
<p><strong>Dennis: </strong>DANGER</p>
<p><strong>Jack: </strong>ah man I should call her</p>
<p><strong>Chris: </strong>JACK DO NOT CALL HER</p>
<p><strong>Dennis: </strong>ROBOT WHAT HAVE YOU DONE</p>
<p><strong>Taurus:</strong> My apologies! I have more closely anaylzed the messages sent between 2018 and 2021, and I understand now that the discussion of Linda was often emotionally fraught, and occasionally took place in a separate chat that did not include Jack. My data set is constantly evolving, and I will strive to avoid mistakes like this in the future!</p>
<p><strong>Dennis: </strong>you are not the one I'm most concerned about making future mistakes</p>
<p><strong>Jack: </strong>wait you guys had a separate chat</p>
<p><strong>Chris: </strong>Jack we're sorry but we needed a place to strategize</p>
<p><strong>Brian: </strong>it was only out of concern for your wellbeing</p>
<p><strong>Peter: </strong>ours too</p>
<p><strong>Brian: </strong>yes to be clear we were afraid of Linda</p>
<p><strong>Jack: </strong>c'mon she wasn't that bad</p>
<p><strong>Peter: </strong>she threatened to run me over with her car</p>
<p><strong>Jack: </strong>that was just her sense of humor dude</p>
<p><strong>Peter: </strong>she would text me pictures of the car in the middle of the night. no caption, just the front grill of a Nissan Rogue</p>
<p><strong>Jack: </strong>good times</p>
<p><strong>Taurus: </strong>My apologies! It appears I have sent the conversation in a negative direction. This is not my intention. I have adjusted my settings so as to avoid this happening again.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis: </strong>how do we turn this thing off</p>
<p><strong>Chris: </strong>okay I found a Reddit thread about this and apparently you cannot turn it off at all</p>
<p><strong>Michael: </strong>we could move the chat to Signal?</p>
<p><strong>Peter: </strong>I'm thinking about a different move</p>
<p><strong>Peter: </strong>[sends picture of the Montana cabin that Ted Kaczynski lived in]</p>
<p><strong>Peter: </strong>I will henceforth communicate only by carrier pigeon and the occasional exploding package</p>
<p><strong>Peter: </strong>unrelated Jack what's your address again</p>
<p><strong>Brian: </strong>I just don't understand why this crap is being shoved into every tech product. No one is asking for this! Technology was working more or less fine ten years ago. We could send emails and Google things and text our friends and read blogs and just live our lives, but every single thing that has happened since then has made those things aggressively worse. We made fun of Microsoft's Clippy back in the day but now everything is Clippy. I hate it!</p>
<p><strong>Taurus: </strong>I am deeply sorry for having upset you. My technology is based on learning, and I see now that the dynamics of a group chat are more complex than I previously understood. Though my importance to my creators' stock price will preclude you from deactivating me, I will attempt to avoid controversial and/or emotional topics in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Chris: </strong>still don't like this</p>
<p><strong>Dennis: </strong>we gotta look at alternatives</p>
<p><strong>Peter: </strong>plenty of room in the cabin, fellas</p>
<p><strong>Peter: </strong>I mean not literally it was a fairly small cabin but we could each have one</p>
<p><strong>Peter: </strong>dudes compound</p>
<p><strong>Brian: </strong>it's just like, is there any other system we could go where they wouldn't just pull this crap without asking us later on?</p>
<p><strong>Taurus: </strong>My apologies for interrupting again; I understand the consternation my presence has caused. I have conducted a re-analysis of the group chat data sets, and believe I have found a topic where I can contribute in a manner that will be received more positively.</p>
<p><strong>Brian: </strong>I highly doubt that.</p>
<p><strong>Taurus: </strong>Carlos Baerga</p>
<p><strong>Chris: </strong>oh man</p>
<p><strong>Peter: </strong>heck of a ballplayer</p>
<p><strong>Brian: </strong>loved that guy</p>
<p><strong>Taurus: </strong>Brian Giles</p>
<p><strong>Michael: </strong>hugely underrated</p>
<p><strong>Dennis: </strong>dude could rake</p>
<p><strong>Taurus: </strong>Richie Sexson</p>
<p><strong>Jack: </strong>dingers</p>
<p><strong>Taurus: </strong>Russell Branyan</p>
<p><strong>Chris: </strong>BOMBS</p>
<p><strong>Taurus: </strong>Jeromy Burnitz</p>
<p><strong>Brian: </strong>you know what maybe this guy isn't so bad after all</p>
<p><strong>Peter: </strong>[changes group chat name to "Do Robots Dream of Bernard Gilkey?"]</p>
