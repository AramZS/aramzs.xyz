<p>The federal government has filed a motion seeking to end asylum claims for the family of Liam Conejo Ramos, according to the lawyer representing the family. The 5-year-old <a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2026/02/01/liam-conejo-ramos-5-returned-to-minnesota-following-judges-order">returned home</a> this week after he was detained with his father on Jan. 20 and sent to a detention center in Texas.</p>
<p>The Department of Homeland Security filed a motion Wednesday to expedite deportation proceedings in the family’s case, said immigration attorney Danielle Molliver with Nwokocha &amp; Operana Law Offices.</p>
<p>A hearing is scheduled for Friday, although Molliver is requesting more time to respond. She said she thought the motion was "retaliatory."</p>
<p>"It's really frustrating as an attorney, because they keep throwing new obstacles in our way. There's absolutely no reason that this should be expedited. It's not very common," Molliver said.</p>
<p>Molliver said the federal government may not deport them to Ecuador, their home country. Instead, the family could apply for asylum in a third country.</p>
<p>Liam’s father, Adrian Conejo Arias, said they don’t know what will happen to them.</p>
<p>"The government is moving many pieces, it's doing everything possible to do us harm, so that they’ll probably deport us. We live with that fear too,” Conejo Arias said. The interview was conducted in Spanish and translated by MPR News.</p>
<p>DHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
