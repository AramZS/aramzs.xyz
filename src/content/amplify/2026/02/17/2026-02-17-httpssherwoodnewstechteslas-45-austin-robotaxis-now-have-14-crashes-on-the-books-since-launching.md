<p>Since launching in June 2025, <a href="https://robinhood.com/us/en/stocks/TSLA/?source=sherwood">Tesla’sTSLA $409.11 (-1.62%)</a> <a href="https://robotaxitracker.com/vehicles?area=austin">45</a> Austin Robotaxis have been involved in 14 crashes, per Electrek reporting citing National Highway Traffic Safety Administration data.</p>
<p>Electrek analysis found that the vehicles have traveled roughly 800,000 paid miles in that time period, amounting to a crash every 57,000 miles. According to the NHTSA, US drivers crash once every 500,000 miles on average.</p>
<p>The article says Tesla submitted five new crash reports in January of this year that happened in December and January. Electrek wrote:</p>
<p>Tesla updated a previously reported crash that was originally filed as only having damaged property to include a passenger’s hospitalization.</p>
<p>Last month, Tesla shares climbed after CEO Elon Musk <a href="https://sherwood.news/tech/elon-musk-says-tesla-robotaxis-are-operating-without-drivers-sending-stock/">said</a> in a post on X that the company’s Austin Robotaxis had begun operating without a safety monitor.</p>
