  ANNANDALE-ON-HUDSON — Two weeks after newly released emails revealed that Bard
  College President Leon Botstein was closer to Jeffrey Epstein than he
  previously admitted, the college’s leadership has not publicly addressed the
  matter nor responded to student calls for Botstein’s resignation.

<p>ANNANDALE-ON-HUDSON — Two weeks after <a href="https://www.timesunion.com/hudsonvalley/news/article/bard-college-leon-botstein-epstein-emails-21335389.php">newly released emails</a> revealed that Bard College President Leon Botstein was <a href="https://www.timesunion.com/hudsonvalley/news/article/leon-botstein-bard-college-epstein-prince-andrew-21349501.php">closer to Jeffrey Epstein than he previously admitted</a>, the college’s leadership has not publicly addressed the matter nor responded to student calls for Botstein’s resignation.</p>

<p>The college’s Board of Trustees met on Monday as students circulated a letter calling for the longtime president to step down. The 35-member board has not publicly responded to the latest trove of emails detailing Botstein’s cozy relationship with the convicted sex offender, released last month by the U.S. Department of Justice.</p>

<p>On a recent weeknight, students packed into the college president’s sprawling Victorian house in the center of campus for a question-and-answer session. Students told the Times Union that Botstein spent several hours speaking with students about the widening Epstein scandal.</p>
<p>“It was a s__ show,” one student said, on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation. “By the end, people were shouting ‘resign.’”</p>
<p>The student said some who attended were “disgusted” by the fact that the meeting was held in Botstein’s house, where he had entertained Epstein.</p>

<p>“I don’t think they get just how furious people are,” the student said.</p>

<p>Students had planned another protest on campus at 2 p.m. on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Trustees have not censured Botstein for the relationship, which the president has characterized as an unpleasant and ultimately unsuccessful attempt at raising money for the college. None of the trustees contacted by the Times Union responded to questions.</p>
<p>Their silence has spawned rumors and at least one fake press release that duped a local news outlet into falsely announcing Botstein’s resignation over the weekend. The phony announcement was sent to reporters from an address that mimicked the name of Bard Communications Director Jennifer Strodl. It remains unclear who sent the email, and the college quickly clarified that Botstein was not stepping down.</p>

<p>But students, alumni and parents are calling for his ouster as details continue to emerge about his relationship with the disgraced financier. An anonymous group calling itself “Concerned Students of Bard College” has in recent days condemned Botstein’s “association with Epstein’s heinous crimes” and called for his removal. In a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/accountabilityforbard/">letter posted to Instagram</a>, the group described the situation as an “institutional failure” and called for Botstein to resign. It was unclear whether they had sent the letter to administrators.</p>
<p>“Botstein’s relationship with Epstein is not just an embarrassing moment in the college’s history; it is a symptom of the culture of sexual misconduct plaguing this institute,” the letter reads. “We demand Botstein’s immediate resignation.”</p>
<p>Tallulah Woitach, a 2024 Bard graduate who has a disability, has been calling for Botstein’s resignation for years. Woitach’s advocacy started due to a lack of accessibility on campus, but she later began speaking out on the school’s handling of sexual assault allegations and Botstein’s ties with Epstein, which started to become publicly known in 2023.</p>
<p>Botstein previously came under fire in 2015 for <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/bard-college-president-sexual-assault_n_56703ac2e4b0e292150f3db3/amp">comparing a drunken woman going to a party</a> to him “walking into a Nuremberg Rally while wearing the yellow badge.” The college has also <a href="https://www.highereddive.com/news/bard-college-faces-3-federal-complaints-over-handling-of-sexual-assault-all/412403/">faced several federal lawsuits</a> in the past decade over its handling of sexual assault allegations.</p>

<p>Leon Botstein, right, Jeffrey Epstein, center, and two unknown women tour Bard College’s campus in Annandale-on-Hudson in May 2013. This image was included in an email sent to Epstein on May 14, 2013, and released as part of the Justice Department’s disclosure of files related to the convicted sex offender.</p>
<p>U.S. Department of Justice</p>
<p>While Bostein has maintained that his relationship with Epstein was solely to secure donations for Bard, his story has shifted over the years in response to new revelations. In 2023, he told the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/05/us/jeffrey-epstein-leon-botstein-bard-college.html">New York Times</a> he never witnessed young female assistants around Epstein, wasn’t present when Epstein’s helicopter arrived at Bard’s campus for visits in 2013, and did not remember whether he had met Epstein during those visits.</p>
<p>But photos from the Justice Department’s Epstein files reveal all of those things to be untrue. And in an open letter to the Bard community last week, Botstein wrote openly about hosting Epstein as a “prospective major donor” on campus as part of a six-year “development prospect” he pursued.</p>
<p>Private correspondence between the two men reveals a more intimate relationship, including some messages that directly contradict Botstein’s characterizations.</p>

<p>Woitach said she tried to organize a protest at her graduation, “but no one wanted to participate” for fear the administration would retaliate. So she wore a white gown painted red with the words “Botstein lies” on the front and “Botstein loves murderers, rapists and pedophiles” on the back. After accepting her diploma — without shaking Botstein’s hand — she sat down in the president’s throne-like chair on stage and <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/tallulah-con-105160218">ripped her diploma to shreds</a>.</p>
<p>A few months later, when doing a stand-up routine at the college’s annual music festival, Woitach’s mic was cut when she began making jokes about Botstein and Epstein, she said. Woitach tried to organize another protest at alumni weekend in October 2024, but was unsuccessful.</p>
<p>“It was very lonely and really difficult to try to stand up to this when you’re the only one,” Woitach said. “It feels like you’re going to get easily snuffed out.”</p>
<p>The recent momentum has been encouraging, Woitach said, but long overdue. Defensive and dismissive responses — or no response at all — by leadership and faculty have particularly troubled her.</p>

<p>“It’s heartbreaking on a deeper level of not knowing who is going to stand up for what’s right at this college that’s supposed to be teaching us to do just that,” she said. “He’s been there for so long and has this talent for cultivating an unwavering sort of loyalty. No matter what happens, they will accept, excuse and explain it away.”</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Strodl, Bard’s director of communications, sent the Times Union the first on-the-record statement from the college. It did not address questions about the trustees’ meeting, the various petitions and protests, or how the college is responding to the fallout from the Epstein emails.</p>
<p>“The president is listening and engaging,” the statement read.</p>

<p>An hour later, the college’s communications department sent out a press release announcing the lineup for Spiegeltent at Bard SummerScape, one of Botstein’s key initiatives. The president, who is also the director of the American Symphony Orchestra, is scheduled to conduct an opera in late July.</p>
