<p><em>Welcome to Late Night Roundup, a rundown of the previous night’s highlights that lets you sleep — and lets us get paid to watch comedy. Here are the </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/arts/television/best-movies-on-netflix.html"><em>50 best movies on Netflix right now</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<h2>‘FCC You’</h2>
<p>Texas State Representative James Talarico did not appear as scheduled on “The Late Show” on Monday, and Stephen Colbert addressed his absence in a segment he was strongly advised against.</p>
<p>“He was supposed to be here, but we were told in no uncertain terms by our network’s lawyers, who called us directly, that we could not have him on the broadcast,” Colbert said of Talarico, a Democrat.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Then I was told, in some uncertain terms, that not only could I not have him on, I could not mention me not having him on. And because my network clearly doesn’t want us to talk about this, let’s talk about this.” <em>— STEPHEN COLBERT</em></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>“You might have heard of this thing called the ‘equal time rule,’ OK? It’s an old FCC rule that applies only to radio and broadcast television — not cable or streaming — that says if a show has a candidate on during an election, they have to have all that candidate’s opponents on as well. It’s the FCC’s most time-honored rule, right after ‘No nipples at the Super Bowl.’” <em>— STEPHEN COLBERT</em></p><p>“There’s long been an exemption for this rule, an exception for news interviews and talk show interviews with politicians. Now, that’s crucial. How else were voters supposed to know back in ’92 that Bill Clinton sucked at saxophone?” <em>— STEPHEN COLBERT</em></p><p>“But on Jan. 21 of this year, a letter was released by FCC chairman and smug bowling pin, Brendan Carr. In this letter, Carr said he was thinking about dropping the exception for talk shows because he said some of them were ‘motivated by partisan purposes.’ Well, sir, you’re chairman of the FCC, so FCC you. Because I think you are motivated by partisan purposes yourself. Sir, ya smelt it ’cause ya dealt it. You are Dutch-ovening America’s airwaves.” — <em>STEPHEN COLBERT</em></p><p>“Let’s just call this what it is: Donald Trump’s administration wants to silence anyone who says anything bad about Trump on TV, because all Trump does is watch TV, OK? He’s like a toddler with too much screen time. He gets cranky and then drops a load in his diaper.” <em>— STEPHEN COLBERT</em></p></blockquote>

He’s going to honor it Monday by posting pictures of all the presidents, some of them not as apes.” <em>— BILL MAHER</em></p><p>“It’s Presidents’ Day, or, as I like to say, Washington and Lincoln’s Birthday.” <em>— TOM SHILLUE, guest hosting ‘Gutfeld’</em></p><p>“Joe Biden celebrated the same way he always does: by setting his clocks back an hour.” <em>— TOM SHILLUE</em></p><p>“Kamala Harris, every time someone said Washington or Lincoln, she did a shot.
