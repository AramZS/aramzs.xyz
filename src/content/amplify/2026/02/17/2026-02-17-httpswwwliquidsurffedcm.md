<p>In the a few minutes, the video shows what FedCM is, how it changes sign‑in on the web, and why <strong>IdP registration</strong> could improve the Sign-In flow in decentralized ecosystem</p>
<h2>Watch the demo</h2>

<h2>What can you do?</h2>
<h3>1) Talk about it and Share the video</h3>
<p>Post it where your community already is: Mastodon, Matrix rooms, academic mailing lists, internal IT channels, or your federation’s working groups.</p>
<h3>2) Submit a real-world use case</h3>
<p>This is the most valuable: concrete examples help justify why IdP registration should exist. Who are the users? What’s painful today? What would improve?</p>
<p>Send us an email, a few word is enough :)</p>
<p><a href="mailto:thhck@proton.me">thhck@proton.me</a></p>
<h3>3) Implement FedCM </h3>
<p>If you’re a dev and work on structure acting as IdP, implement FedCM to your IdP.</p>
<p>This would help us proove real interest on this feature. Implementing a Proof of Concept is a proof of interest !</p>
