I should know, I’ve finished this thing nine times like it’s a peer-reviewed study and I’m up for tenure.</p><p>It doesn’t mean the game is an unassailable masterpiece. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2021/05/07/every-resident-evil-game-ranked/" target="_blank">Like much of the series,</a> it loses its footing in the back half, while its opening stretch does the heavy lifting and lingers longest in memory. But what an opening stretch! The Rhodes Hill Chronic Care Center is the strongest level the series has produced since the original trilogy at the turn of the century.</p><p>Its layout isn’t radical on paper: a two-winged structure anchored by a central hall, with symmetrical staircases fanning outward like a rib cage. The architecture leans hard into gothic Victorian excess and institutional dread. But what makes it special is how completely it commits to being a puzzle box. Every room feeds the same oppressive purpose, every locked door and looping corridor reinforcing the sense that this place was designed to keep people inside.</p><p>Released Friday on PC and console platforms including the Nintendo Switch 2, “Requiem” is the continuation of the longest-running horror series in video games. Resident Evil occupies a unique space in pop culture. Creator Shinji Mikami was famously assigned the project because he was a big scaredy cat. Unburdened by genre clichés, he had a fresh perspective that helped resurrect the zombie genre in the early 2000s, dragging it out of cult obscurity and back into the mainstream by turning shambling horror into a global, interactive obsession. Mikami has since retired, but Capcom still has enough yellow-bellied people working on the game to secure the series legacy.</p><p class="rw-outer-content"><span>Some content could not be imported from the original document.</span> <a href="https://washingtonpost.com/entertainment/video-games/2026/02/25/resident-evil-requiem-video-game-review/">View content ↗ </a></p><p>“In Japan, although it’s less common now, there was a time when so-called supernatural phenomenon TV shows were very popular,” says Masato Kumazawa, the game’s producer. “I wasn’t particularly good with that kind of content myself.”</p><p>The zombies bring this chapter to life. Earlier games flirted with this idea, but in “Requiem,” many of the undead retain the faint outlines of the people they once were. The care center is staffed by the dead: doctors, nurses, janitors, kitchen workers — familiar roles turned hostile. These zombies are smarter than ever, able to move between rooms, follow sounds and reappear where you least expect them.</p><p>Rather than relying on a single towering pursuer — marquee monsters like Mr. X of “RE2,” built to stalk you across entire maps — “Requiem” disperses that tension across its entire cast. Groups converge. Stragglers wander in at the wrong moment. Here, the connection between monsters and environment is at its most unsettling: creatures fumble with light switches, clamber over furniture with grim familiarity and rely on quiet digital sleight of hand that convinces you they know exactly where they are, and where you are, too. Blood splatters from your past fights stain the walls and ceilings of the care center in probably the most visually impressive recreation of gore ever committed to a game. Larger threats will often pin you against smaller mobs of foes, resulting in constant, low-grade panic attacks.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/wapo/QMTGWHHHEBH2JLAF5KHHSUT7VY.png"/><figcaption>The zombies that appear early in “Resident Evil Requiem” retain vestiges of their past lives, which creates a spooky, many-layered funhouse of job archetypes. (Capcom)</figcaption></figure><p>As “Requiem” opens, the FBI assigns analyst Grace Ashcroft to investigate a homicide at the same hotel where her mother was murdered, a tragedy that left her traumatized and prone to panic attacks. She makes an impressive debut leading the slower-paced puzzle box segments, drawing blood from corpses and bloodied floors to concoct helpful items, another example of how this game deepens environmental interaction. While investigating linked deaths tied to survivors of the doomed 1998 Raccoon City zombie outbreak, she heads to the care center and bumps into fellow federal agent Leon Kennedy, the series’ long-running heartthrob and Raccoon City’s most famous survivor, now older, broader and inexplicably hotter for having endured hell.</p><p>Resident Evil has centered on multiple protagonists since its 1996 debut, sometimes to its detriment as with the much-maligned sixth game. Leon’s first game, “Resident Evil 2,” which offered two different game scenarios in one story, remains the series highlight. “Requiem” is another highlight, a showcase of what developer Capcom has learned since revitalizing the series, pairing Grace’s arc with 2017′s slow-burn seventh game, “Biohazard,” and updating Leon’s action gameplay.</p><p>The new game benefits from the franchise’s most costly misstep. “Resident Evil 6” tried to tell a single, sweeping story across wildly different play styles, forcing players through rigid funnels and wrecking its own pacing in the process. “Requiem” takes the opposite approach under director Koshi Nakanishi, who sets a pace that serves the game’s demands.</p><p>“By having the two characters specialize separately in horror and action, the balance between the two creates an unprecedented rhythm of tension and release,” Nakanishi says. “If the action becomes too prominent, the sense of horror fades. If the horror is too intense, the game can become exhausting to play. We always strive for the right balance between the two.”</p><p>Through his stewardship of past games in the series, including the milestone “Biohazard,” which rejuvenated the franchise in recent years, Nakanishi has become an expert on different styles of horror. He describes Eastern horror as beholden to grudges and curses, while the West prefers creature features.</p><p>“That said, isn’t the fear of death at its core something shared by all humanity?” he says, adding that a lack of information or limited means to fight back heightens awareness of one’s fragility. “Even if the object of fear differs, as long as it evokes the idea of death, people will fear. Incidentally, I think that since around the 2000s, horror films have increasingly blended Eastern and Western approaches.”</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/wapo/3V3FYHBLM5FEVE74CB4D7W3JEA.png"/><figcaption>The Rhodes Hill Chronic Care Center is a classic “Resident Evil” location; its architecture leans hard into gothic Victorian excess and institutional dread. (Capcom)</figcaption></figure><p>“Resident Evil” may be drenched in gore, but much of its creative team are devotees of detective fiction, including Kumazawa. That blend of influences shapes the best moments of “Requiem,” where fresh horrors are filtered through Grace’s curious, searching eye.</p><p>“It’s scary but you’re also left wanting to know what happens next,” Kumazawa said. “There’s a sense of mystery, and there is also a strong sense of accomplishment when you overcome that fear.”</p><p>Unfortunately, the game falters once Leon takes center stage and returns to Raccoon City, which was reduced to rubble by a nuclear strike in 1998. The series has long thrived on visually distinctive spaces, but Capcom does surprisingly little with the idea of nuclear fallout. Leon’s sections are dominated by dusty, bombed-out buildings stripped of personality and surprise. This is a familiar problem for every game in the series, as each opens with remarkable confidence only to have the level of design and encounter quality taper off as it goes on.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/wapo/IQJZIH67FVGDVLJHSG5UW3EGIU.png"/><figcaption>Longtime “Resident Evil” hero Leon Kennedy returns to Raccoon City for the first time since the first zombie outbreak and subsequent nuclear bombing. (Capcom)</figcaption></figure><p>Yes, the city was erased by a bomb, but this is a series defined by ornamented excess. In a world so comfortable with the fantastical, Raccoon City could have been reimagined as something stranger, more grotesque. Even the zombies feel diminished, drained of all personality and reduced to familiar targets. They remain satisfying to dispatch — Leon’s melee flourishes, now freely executable with the R trigger and his hatchet, see to that. But the encounters lack the texture and tension that made the care center feel so alive.</p><p>The puzzle-box design is also unwound dramatically for action funnels that at least offer some interesting scenarios, including Leon and his enemies fighting atop glass ceilings that crack under their weight for vertical action. It’s not that Leon’s segments are bad; this game’s weaker second half is stronger than most in the series. But the writing never fully conveys the narrative weight of Leon’s return. There are hints of a deeper character arc, but as so often with this franchise, those ideas stop at suggestion, never pushing far enough to feel truly consequential.</p><p>This is where it matters that I’ve played the game nine times. “Resident Evil” games are built for replay, a series tradition that rewards familiarity as much as fear. I beat this game in many of the traditional ways I’ve done over the last 30 years. I did a run without healing or crafting. I did a run on the hardest difficulty setting. I even shaved my original completion time of 12 hours down to 2½. I can confirm that “Requiem” is as great as any Resident Evil game can be.</p><p>Even with my reservations about Leon’s section and an ending that doesn’t quite stick the landing, I always find myself drifting back to Grace and the extraordinary care center, now forearmed with knowledge, shortcuts, and hard-earned instincts. At that point, finishing the game becomes less about survival than ritual. The tension softens into rhythm. Routes are memorized, dangers anticipated, mistakes managed instead of feared. It’s the same cognitive satisfaction as solving a Rubik’s Cube that you already understand, the comfort of mastery, achieved again and again.</p><p>The game’s replayability is amplified by the choice between first- and third-person perspectives for both characters. Each perspective comes with its own animation set, giving fights and movement a distinct sense of weight. Playing Grace in the third person evokes the feel of a long-lost classic, while experiencing Leon in first person transforms the game into a strange hybrid, part “Call of Duty”-style shooter, part punchy, kinetic melee system. “Requiem” almost feels like four games in one, so why not play it at least four times — or nine?</p><p>“Requiem” isn’t flawless, but it doesn’t need to be. Its levels breathe, its mechanics reward mastery and like good zombies, its creatures never stop moving. Fear, strategy and ritual coexist here in a way few games achieve, and even after nine playthroughs, it continues to surprise, challenge and delight. For a series built on tension and curiosity, this is a return that feels alive and impossible to put down.</p></body></html>
