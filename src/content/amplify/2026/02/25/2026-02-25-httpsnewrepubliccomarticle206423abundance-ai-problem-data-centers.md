<p>In early February, Axios <a href="https://www.axios.com/2026/02/08/centrist-democrats-new-group-abundance">reported</a> that “Ezra Klein’s Abundance movement is getting some backup” in the form of a new group: Next American Era, headed by former Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee head, Illinois congresswoman, and longtime Washington insider Cheri Bustos. Bustos’s group, per the report, would be committed to “‘pro-growth,’ deregulatory policies.” This is hardly surprising; for the past several years Bustos has been a literal corporate lobbyist at the <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/politico-influence/2026/01/21/trump-2-0-unleashes-a-gusher-on-k-street-00740391">extremely Trump-connected outfit</a> Mercury Partners. Mercury saw its profits more than double in 2025 as it sold access to the Trump throne room.</p>
<p>Over the course of the three years for which we have <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/federal-lobbying/lobbyists/summary?cycle=2025&amp;id=Y0000061999L">lobbying disclosures</a>, Bustos branched out from lobbying overwhelmingly on behalf of agriculture firms and municipal governments to <a href="https://therevolvingdoorproject.org/new-abundance-group-ai-lobbysits/">work</a> for energy firms and software behemoths, as well. In particular, Bustos registered as a lobbyist for OpenAI and Larry Ellison’s Oracle, two of the most central companies in the bubblish AI industry that is becoming increasingly omnipresent in our politics, economy, and daily lives. The two firms were also the biggest clients in Bustos’s portfolio; Oracle’s 2025 lobbying expenditures totaled over $11 million, while OpenAI’s were just under $3 million. Bustos’s next-largest clients in 2025 were Korea Zinc and battery manufacturer Gotion, both with around $2.5 million in total lobbying.</p>
<p>Facially, it seems odd for someone like Bustos, fresh off a stint of AI lobbying, to launch a centrist 501c(4) and immediately align with the abundance agenda, which generally represents itself as a movement focused on housing and utility transmission permitting. In reality, it’s of a kind with a <a href="https://therevolvingdoorproject.org/abundance-tech-ai-optimism-next-american-era/">deep techno-optimist</a>, pro-AI undercurrent that has permeated abundance thought since before Derek Thompson <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/01/scarcity-crisis-college-housing-health-care/621221/">coined</a> the phrase “abundance agenda” in 2022.</p>
<figure></figure><p>In the spring of 2025, Thompson and Klein’s tome, <i>Abundance,</i> launched to a firestorm of discourse, both praise and criticism. Nearly a year later, the blaze has lessened—Trumpian destruction of the economy and democracy tends to take the wind out of the sails of cockeyed optimists, after all—but tensions in what writers on both sides (namely, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/05/abundance-democrats-political-power/682929/">Jonathan Chait</a> and <a href="https://www.levernews.com/how-to-end-democrats-civil-war/">David Sirota</a>) have called the “Democrats’ Civil War” continue to simmer.</p>
<p>The abundance ecosystem has <a href="https://www.niskanencenter.org/the-rise-of-the-abundance-faction/">tried to develop</a> a “grass-tops” movement, which parlays an elite influence campaign into building a mass constituency. Abundance world has certainly been successful at the first part; with hundreds of millions of dollars (this figure is meant literally, not figuratively) flowing into abundance organizations and Klein playing an <a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/08/18/2024/the-new-york-times-ezra-klein-problem">intellectual power-broker role</a> within Democratic politics—to the point that it raised eyebrows internally at <i>The New York Times</i>, according to <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/11/16/ezra-klein-power-play-democrats">reporting</a> from Axios. But with sitting mayors and governors explicitly name-checking the book and its authors, abundance has thoroughly permeated the political class. It has not, however, been as successful at building a broad-base constituency. (It is perhaps difficult to focus on a gauzy future of plenty when fascist shock troops are loose on the streets, acting with impunity.)</p>
<p>Despite <i>Abundance</i> making the<i> New York Times</i> bestseller list (tech tycoon Reid Hoffman <a href="https://x.com/teddyschleifer/status/1950280434455122022">sending copies</a> to everyone he knows probably didn’t hurt), Democratic voters have been notably leery about the abundance framework. <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/04/democratic-research-finds-voters-prefer-populism-over-abundance-00543188">Polling</a> <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/05/28/democratic-voters-polling-populism-abundance">has</a> shown that the base is far more interested in tackling corporate greed than it is in municipal red tape, and Klein’s attempts to cast himself as a bipartisan mediator in the wake of the Charlie Kirk assassination have <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/charlie-kirk-ezra-klein-tanehisi-coates">undermined</a> his status as a leading light on the left.</p>
<p>At the Abundance 2025 conference, prominent abundance think tanker Alex Trembath of the Breakthrough Institute stood up to forcefully decry any allegations that the movement had been organized by elites, <a href="https://thebreakthrough.org/articles/bottom-up-abundance">claiming</a> that “abundance is not this astroturfed conspiracy. In fact, just the opposite: Abundance is emergent. Abundance is bottom-up.” He followed this declaration with the romantic sentiment that it was not donors who brought this movement together but fate, saying, “We were not herded and orchestrated: We found each other. The people and ideas in this ballroom pull on strands from multiple fields—think tanks, activists, organizers, elected officials, journalists, philanthropists, technologists, and entrepreneurs and investors.”</p>
<p>That is, notably, not what a bottom-up movement is. Grassroots movements are built on a foundation of organizing and mobilizing a mass membership. What Trembath actually described is very clearly a grass-tops strategy. Many people within abundance circles recognize, sometimes <a href="https://therevolvingdoorproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Grasstops-pt.1.png">even</a> <a href="https://therevolvingdoorproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Grasstops-pt.2.png">celebrate</a>, this dynamic. It was this very strategy that the Niskanen Center spelled out in its June 2024 <a href="https://www.niskanencenter.org/the-rise-of-the-abundance-faction/">manifesto</a> charting how to build a so-called “abundance faction.”</p>
<p>The push for a bipartisan grand coalition, also laid out in Niskanen’s manifesto, has not succeeded either. The right flank of the abundance ecosystem has openly embraced some of the most vile parts of Trumpism. In the lead-up to Abundance 2025, the Manhattan Institute’s Charles Lehman, one of the speakers at the conference, <a href="https://www.city-journal.org/multimedia/elons-america-can-the-billionaire-reboot-the-right">called</a> <a href="https://x.com/CharlesFLehman/status/1930393510814883873">for</a> “deportation abundance.”</p>
<p>Even Spencer Cox, who headlined alongside Klein and Thompson, and has a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/06/29/spencer-cox-trump-skeptic-far-right-challenge-00165866">long-standing reputation</a> as a (relatively) compassionate moderate who wants us all to “disagree better,” has <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2025/12/spencer-cox-trump-support.html">veered toward</a> rank partisanship and <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/09/gov-spencer-cox-has-been-preaching-calm-in-a-violent-moment-but-whats-missing/">entrenching the power</a> of an ever more authoritarian Republican Party. Cox moved to pack the Utah Supreme Court in order to gerrymander Salt Lake City, in what was an awfully aggressive approach for anyone who isn’t dead set on preserving the MAGA regime. The gerrymander would have only picked up one seat. But Cox has embraced a cosmic view of politics, where Donald Trump’s survival from an assassination attempt in 2024 was “miraculous,” spinning a borderline messianic interpretation of Trump’s candidacy and <a href="https://x.com/SpencerJCox/status/1814349166719709270">saying</a> to Trump, “You, and only you, can be [the] kind of leader” it will take to repair the country.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Trump officials who were praised by abundance advocates as sage and reasonable, <a href="https://therevolvingdoorproject.org/abundance-praise-for-trump-appointees/">particularly</a> Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, have been anything but. Wright has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/us-senator-says-he-is-concerned-energy-secretary-acting-nuclear-firms-interest-2025-09-23/">raised concerns</a> that he is using his post to advance the business interests of the nuclear energy firm Oklo, where he was previously a board member, and is <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/us-led-oil-sales-venezuela-bring-5-billion-months-energy-chief-wright-tells-nbc-2026-02-12/">taking point</a> on the American colonial takeover of the Venezuelan oil industry. Burgum is <a href="https://prospect.org/2026/02/13/doug-burgum-interior-department-regime-toady-of-our-time/">keeping busy</a> cheerleading threats to annex Greenland, ignoring natural disasters in the actual interior, explicitly serving the oil and gas industry, and whitewashing American history by scrubbing any discussion of climate change, colonial violence toward Native Americans, and other stains on our heritage from national parks and monuments. Oh, lest we forget, he also oversaw the removal of the word “transgender” from the Stonewall monument, where his Interior Department <a href="http://advocate.com/politics/stonewall-monument-pride-flag">recently</a> <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/5736941-pride-flag-returns-stonewall-national-monument/">abortively removed</a> the Pride flag itself.</p>
<p>Curtis Yarvin, whom prominent abundance intellectual Steve Teles links to in <a href="https://www.niskanencenter.org/abundance-varieties/#dark-abundance">this piece</a> as the far-right edge of abundance, is considered central to the “new right,” which James Pogue <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2022/04/inside-the-new-right-where-peter-thiel-is-placing-his-biggest-bets">described</a> as “a project to overthrow the thrust of progress, at least such as liberals understand the word.” Yarvin, an antidemocracy nutball who wants to replace the republican system of government with a dictatorship or monarchy, also believes white people are innately more intelligent than other races, and has minimized slavery.</p>
<p>Despite this movement being studded by such miscreants and autocratic enablers, abundance is poised to exert significant influence in the near term, especially through a donor class that absolutely loves it and inside organizing like Ezra Klein’s appearance at a major Senate Democratic retreat. But if abundance liberals are to avoid missing the moment and find durable standing within center-left politics, they have to confront a glaring contradiction: their relationship to the AI industry.</p>
<p>AI skepticism and populist anger at data centers are surging. But abundance groups are increasingly aligning with deeply unpopular tech-titan pet projects like California Forever, an attempt by Silicon Valley bigwigs to build their own city from scratch between Sacramento and San Francisco. Housing policy group California YIMBY <a href="https://sfstandard.com/2024/06/21/california-forever-east-solano-plan-yimby/">endorsed</a> the plan, which led to California state Senator Christopher Cabaldon expressing confusion at a recent conference. California Forever also <a href="https://progressiveabundance.com/">sponsored</a> a recent “Festival of Progressive Abundance” in Los Angeles. The Charter Cities Institute, which advocates for the creation of autonomous cities unbound by existing legal code and envisioned as techno-optimist Meccas, sent an <a href="https://www.aei.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Homesteading-2.0-and-Freedom-Cities-Open-Letter.pdf">open letter</a> to the Trump administration in support of Freedom Cities, alongside researchers at the American Enterprise Institute, or AEI, which is considered an abundance organization in the <a href="https://www.inclusiveabundance.org/abundance-in-action/abundance-landscape/">list</a> maintained by Inclusive Abundance, the ecosystem’s main organizing arm.</p>
<p>On top of AEI, there is a host of other broadly pro-tech libertarian think tanks included in the Inclusive Abundance list, such as the (Koch-aligned) Cato Institute, the Cicero Institute (chaired by Palantir co-founder Joe Lonsdale), primary Charles Koch influence operation Americans for Prosperity, and the Federation for American Innovation. FAI alum Michael Kratsios, now the head of the White House Office of Science and Technology, has been an <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/08/remarks-by-director-kratsios-at-the-apec-digital-and-ai-ministerial-meeting/">aggressive AI booster</a> and <a href="https://prospect.org/2025/09/23/2025-09-23-ted-cruz-attempts-to-exempt-big-tech-from-law/">was central</a> to Texas Senator Ted Cruz’s legislation that attempted to create a mechanism to functionally exempt the AI industry from any and all federal regulation.</p>
<p>Don’t just take it from me that abundance sometimes is awfully close to tech-libertarians; the Cato Institute itself has <a href="https://www.cato.org/free-society/fall-2025/unplanned-path-abundance">said so</a>, and it is generally expert at what libertarianism means.</p>
<figure></figure><p>Abundance has been marketed as a movement focused on solving the crisis of housing affordability, but there has always been a distinct techno-optimist bent to the movement that looks favorably on AI and Silicon Valley. In the opening utopian vignette of <i>Abundance,</i> Klein and Thompson identify widely distributed wealth from artificial intelligence as the internal mechanism that enables our supposedly impending sci-fi-flavored future. Klein, in particular, was quite <a href="https://therevolvingdoorproject.org/dont-listen-to-ezra-klein-annul-the-bigtech-democrats-marriage/">vocal</a> that a major driver of his side of the project was about repairing the frayed relationship between progressives and technology—both the concept itself and the tech industry centered around Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>The Abundance 2025 conference, judging by its <a href="https://www.abundancedc.org/eventagenda">schedule</a>, had as much programming around AI as it did around housing (there was more directly focusing on energy policy than either, though energy and AI are deeply interconnected). The author of President Trump’s AI Action Plan, Dean Ball (now at FAI), was a <a href="https://www.levernews.com/trump-abundance-and-dark-money-a-trio-made-in-ai-heaven/">featured speaker</a> at the conference, as was NVIDIA’s director of infrastructure policy and multiple other champions of AI.</p>
<p>Moreover, much, if not most, of the <a href="https://prospect.org/2024/11/26/2024-11-26-abundance-agenda-neoliberalisms-rebrand/">funding</a> <a href="https://therevolvingdoorproject.org/who-is-behind-the-growing-abundance-movement/">flowing</a> into <a href="https://theabundantfuture.substack.com/p/how-we-make-abundance-a-lasting-movement">abundance organizing</a> is closely linked to powerful Silicon Valley figures. Following the release of Klein and Thompson’s book, Open Philanthropy (another sponsor of the abundance conferences, since rechristened Coefficient Giving), which was launched by Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz, <a href="https://coefficientgiving.org/research/announcing-our-new-120m-abundance-and-growth-fund/">unveiled</a> a $120 million fund focused on advancing abundance ideas. Half of the fund—$60 million—came from Stripe’s Patrick Collison. Arnold Ventures is a frequent abundance funder, which launched the Abundance Academic Network and a <a href="https://therealnews.com/vox-silicon-valley-funded-abundance-vertical-political-priorities">new abundance-flavored Vox vertical</a>, among others. John Arnold made his fortune in energy trading and more recently joined the board of Meta specifically to serve as an energy adviser for data-center buildout. When welcoming Arnold to the board, Mark Zuckerberg <a href="https://investor.atmeta.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2024/Hock-E.-Tan-and-John-Arnold-to-Join-Meta-Board-of-Directors/default.aspx">said</a> that, “as we focus on building AGI,” Arnold’s “deep experience” in “energy infrastructure will help us execute our long-term vision.”</p>
<p>Ever wonder why AI advocates downplay the climate implications of natural gas–fueled AI data centers? Consider Renaissance Philanthropy, an early pro-abundance foundation, which was created with money from former Google CEO Eric Schmidt. Schmidt has publicly stated that humans will never manage to control climate change, and that our best bet is to pour near-unlimited resources into developing an AI that can solve the issue for us. And Schmidt’s views are hardly niche within the realm of our would-be <a href="https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/adam-becker/more-everything-forever/9781541619593/">AI oligarchs</a>.</p>
<p>In the most on-the-nose example, Abundance 2025 also had two literal trade associations that represent major tech firms among its sponsors: Chamber of Progress and the New American Industrial Alliance. The former of these is funded by literally every prominent AI firm in the game, from Marc Andreessen’s a16z to Amazon, Apple, Google, OpenAI, NVIDIA, Midjourney, and others.</p>
<p>None of this is an aberration: Silicon Valley has been at the forefront of developing abundance thought since its inception. Among the earliest proto-abundance treatises was an <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/07/we-need-new-science-progress/594946/">essay</a> in <i>The Atlantic</i> co-authored by Patrick Collison and Tyler Cowen that called for the launch of a new science dedicated to studying how to achieve progress, which they creatively dubbed “progress studies.” In the seven years since their essay, progress studies has intermingled with other movements, such as effective altruism and rationalism, mainline Koch-style libertarianism, and supply-side progressivism, with a dash of technofascism comprising what Steve Teles has <a href="https://www.niskanencenter.org/abundance-varieties/#dark-abundance">christened</a> the “Dark Abundance” subfaction. The amalgamation of all these strands led to what we now would call the abundance movement (or ecosystem).</p>
<p>Cowen, in turn, runs key abundance funder Emergent Ventures, which was launched with a grant from Palantir’s Peter Thiel. Patrick Collison has marshaled part of his fortune to organize an <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/patrick-collison-dreams-abundance-verse">annual retreat</a> for abundance diehards in Sevastopol, California, where those invested in the success of the movement can gather, commiserate, and plan future efforts. Venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, whose a16z invests heavily in AI, fintech, and crypto, wrote his own <a href="https://a16z.com/the-techno-optimist-manifesto/">call</a> for abundance in 2023, titled “The Techno Optimist Manifesto,” with a whole chapter on “abundance.” Notably, one of Ezra Klein’s early <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/4/22/21228469/marc-andreessen-build-government-coronavirus">proto-abundance columns</a> built on another <a href="https://a16z.com/2020/04/18/its-time-to-build/">viral Andreessen essay</a>.</p>
<p>Now, it should be noted that there are some in the abundance ecosystem who have been critical of AI in recent years. Thompson, while an enthusiastic fan of AI, who has been explicit about wanting to convince skeptics, has <a href="https://www.derekthompson.org/p/artificial-intelligence-could-be">written</a> <a href="https://www.derekthompson.org/p/the-ai-hypocrisy-at-the-heart-of">about</a> the technology’s downsides; fledgling abundance magazine The Argument (itself frequently <a href="https://www.theargumentmag.com/p/why-women-should-be-tech-optimists">techno-optimist</a> and <a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/08/17/2025/with-the-argument-the-left-gets-a-new-publication">replete</a> with Silicon Valley funding from Arnold, Collison, Open Philanthropy, and Emergent Ventures) has published <a href="https://www.theargumentmag.com/p/we-need-to-be-able-to-sue-ai-companies">several</a> <a href="https://www.theargumentmag.com/p/chatgpt-and-the-end-of-learning">good</a> <a href="https://www.theargumentmag.com/p/you-have-18-months">articles</a> that scrutinize the more boondogglish side of Silicon Valley’s latest obsession.</p>
<p>Even beyond the array of pro-AI interests lining up behind the abundance agenda, though, the AI industry and the data-center construction boom raise what should be uncomfortable questions for abundance advocates.</p>
<p>The movement’s central premise is that we can’t build and that we have created too many veto points that let parochial interests block important construction projects. But the data-center boom clearly shows that we can build. Or at least that mega corporations can when they put their minds to it. Granted, the sets of restrictions that apply to multifamily housing, energy transmission infrastructure, and industrial-scale data centers are all different, but frequently abundance proponents target the exact types of procedural bottlenecks that communities that don’t want data centers are using to block or delay tens of billions of dollars’ worth of them from popping up. In particular, community input meetings, <a href="https://www.promarket.org/2025/07/30/how-abundance-amplifies-the-doge-narrative/">air quality standards</a>, and <a href="https://www.commondreams.org/opinion/musk-xai-public-interest-suit">public interest lawsuits</a> are frequent boogeymen of the abundance framework. But they are now the chief means by which communities are fighting back.</p>
<p>The data-center buildout also creates acute examples of why the types of bottlenecks that abundists decry are both absolutely necessary and, sometimes, still too weak. Examples of massive data-center projects being built against the wishes of their neighbors have become commonplace, to the point that foisting <a href="https://www.commercialappeal.com/story/opinion/contributors/2025/06/19/musk-xai-memphis-trump-spat/84246539007/?gnt-cfr=1&amp;gca-cat=p&amp;gca-uir=false&amp;gca-epti=z11xx28p001650c001650u117028v11xx28&amp;gca-ft=400&amp;gca-ds=sophi">nondisclosure agreements</a> upon elected officials <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2025/04/30/data-centers-non-disclosure-agreements-and-democracy/">over the details</a> of the terms local government is giving to AI companies to build in their communities for economic development is becoming something of an <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/data-center-ai-google-amazon-nda-non-disclosure-agreement-colossus-rcna236423">industry standard</a>.</p>
<p>Abundance tells us that we struggle to build and that procedural measures like public interest lawsuits, zoning restrictions, and community input meetings are blocking essential public goods. But then, at the same time, it has so far offered no comment on the reality that we are building plenty of data centers, often even while overcoming those democratic processes.</p>
<p>In Memphis, when Elon Musk’s xAI started operating without going through the permitting process—<a href="https://www.selc.org/news/resistance-against-elon-musks-xai-facility-in-south-memphis-gets-stronger/">potentially illegally</a>—we got a taste of how things work without the “bottlenecks” that figures like Thompson and Klein decry. The data center <a href="https://prospect.org/2025/07/09/2025-07-09-ai-cancer-cost-trump-fossil-fuels/">spewed toxic gas</a> over a community that already bore significant air pollution, and did it without the public even knowing about it; more than a dozen local officials signed NDAs, which led to even some City Council members being completely in the dark about xAI’s operations in the city.</p>
<p>Perhaps Musk’s “Colossus” data center couldn’t have been built or would have taken much longer if it hadn’t pulled the wool over the eyes of residents and their government and had actually followed the law. But the flip side is that the progress that those costs have borne is a chatbot that, while it does sometimes fact-check kooky conspiracy claims, declared itself “MechaHitler,” provided planning assistance for a home invasion, removed clothes from people’s pictures on X without their consent, and generated thousands upon thousands of images of child pornography. Thankfully, the only cost for creating such an innovative piece of technology was an entire community being bombarded with toxic emissions that cause cancer and respiratory disease. Data-center expansion is already causing tens of billions of dollars in additional public health costs annually, disproportionately in poor, minority-majority areas like South Memphis.</p>
<p>Moreover this type of “behind-the-meter” energy supply is <a href="https://cleanview.co/content/power-strategies-report">extremely common</a> and trending up. More than three-fourths of the on-site power currently being brought online at data centers is natural gas, which, while its fumes are less toxic than coal’s, still <a href="https://cdn.catf.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/14175846/fossil-fumes-report-2022.pdf?_gl=1*i6z3vd*_gcl_au*Mzc1OTkzNTU2LjE3NzA5MTg0Njk.*_ga*R0ExLjEuMjkxMTk5MDIyLjE3NzA5MTg0Njg.*_ga_88025VJ2M0*czE3NzA5MTg0NjckbzEkZzEkdDE3NzA5MTg0NzkkajQ5JGwwJGgw">emits large amounts</a> of carcinogenic and <a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/climate-health-c-change/news/negative-impacts-of-burning-natural-gas-and-biomass-have-surpassed-coal-generation-in-many-states/">toxic pollutants</a>. Even worse, many data centers have diesel backup generators, which are far more <a href="https://prospect.org/2025/07/09/2025-07-09-ai-cancer-cost-trump-fossil-fuels/">detrimental</a> to the health of people living nearby, particularly because of higher levels of nitrogen oxide and PM2.5 particles.</p>
<figure></figure><p>Public sentiment is also clearly turning against data centers. While polling indicates that voters are largely agnostic on data-center buildout as a hypothetical, there is a large body of evidence on the underlying elements that shows deep hostility toward the AI industry.</p>
<p>Politico and Public First recently <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/06/tech-industry-ai-data-centers-politics-00762348?utm_source=firefox-newtab-en-us">found</a> that 37 percent of respondents supported data centers to 28 percent opposed, with another 28 percent neither supporting or opposing, though with a major split along party lines; Democrats narrowly opposed, 36 percent to 33 (27 percent for neither), while Republicans had fairly strong support, 45 percent to 26 (24 percent for neither). This is similar to what NBC <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/nbc-news-polls/poll-americans-form-views-ai-divided-role-school-everyday-life-rcna212782">found</a> in the summer of 2025, with 44 percent of respondents thinking AI would improve their family’s future versus 42 percent who thought it would make it worse. News site Heatmap <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/data-center-survey">found</a> that only 44 percent of respondents supported a data center being built, even less than other types of energy infrastructure, including gas-fired power plants and nuclear reactors. There is also a <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/01/15/americans-use-ai-products-poll">substantial</a> <a href="https://today.yougov.com/technology/articles/51803-americans-increasingly-skeptical-about-ai-artificial-intelligence-effects-poll">polling</a> <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3923">literature</a> that shows Americans are deeply apprehensive of AI generally, although with very different views along gender lines—men tend to be positive about AI, while women are skeptical.</p>
<p>While apathy may be the prevailing mood nationally, with most voters <a href="https://www.dataforprogress.org/blog/2025/9/8/most-voters-are-unaware-of-construction-of-data-centers-in-their-state-and-the-environmental-impacts-they-cause">having heard nothing</a> at all about data-center construction, nearly every state or county-level case study available shows massive backlash brewing. Most tellingly, in the places where people have heard about data centers, they detest them. Virginia Democrats vocally ran against data centers last year and scored impressive wins. The 30th district, which includes data-center capital of the world Loudoun County, saw the incumbent Republican ousted by John McAuliff, who worked overtime to tie his opponent to the data centers. Similarly, 2025 saw two statewide spots on the Georgia Public Service Commission flip to Democrats over anger about data-center-fueled energy price hikes, the first statewide races the party had won in decades. State-level polling has shown antipathy in the ever-crucial swing states of <a href="https://emersoncollegepolling.com/pennsylvania-survey-on-data-centers-artificial-intelligence/">Pennsylvania</a>, <a href="https://www.thecentersquare.com/wisconsin/article_1c34bdeb-9597-4b51-8b26-b7159b487bc5.html">Wisconsin</a>, and <a href="https://progressmichigan.org/2025/12/new-poll-majority-of-michiganders-opposed-to-controversial-data-centers/">Michigan</a>.</p>
<p>A growing number of localities have also instituted a pause on new data-center construction, including <a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/prince-georges-county-to-pause-data-center-development/3988847/">Prince George’s County</a> in Maryland; <a href="https://www.ksdk.com/article/news/local/st-charles-ai-data-center-ban-first-in-nation/63-2c50fbcf-fcad-4b8d-bbcb-3711f6c2d29d">St. Charles</a>, Missouri; <a href="https://www.gpb.org/news/2025/10/22/wave-of-data-center-ordinances-sweep-through-ga-counties-how-strict-are-they">several Atlanta-area counties</a>; and <a href="https://dailyjournal.net/2025/11/24/3-counties-put-moratoriums-on-data-center-projects/">several counties in Indiana</a>. State-level restrictions and moratoria are being debated across the country, from <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/06/new-york-democrats-propose-sweeping-pause-on-data-center-construction-00768090">New York</a> to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2026/jan/26/georgia-datacenters-ai-ban">Georgia</a> to <a href="https://calmatters.org/economy/technology/2025/02/data-center-crackdown-to-protect-california-electricity-rates/">California</a>. Given all of that, it’s hardly surprising that Morning Consult has <a href="https://pro.morningconsult.com/analysis/ai-data-center-energy-prices-november-2025">shown</a> that support for banning data-center construction has been surging; just between October and November 2025, the policy went from down by two points to up by five. It is becoming increasingly clear that this <a href="https://prospect.org/2025/09/05/2025-09-05-democrats-must-oppose-ai-industry/">moment</a> <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/202878/ai-data-centers-democrats-election-wedge-issue">calls</a> for <a href="https://libertyandpower.substack.com/p/7-hard-lessons-democrats-must-learn">campaigning</a> on AI skepticism.</p>
<p>Abundance proponents, however, seem determined to swim against the current of public opinion. For some, as Eric Levitz <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/473715/ai-data-center-chatgpt-electricity-polls">implies</a> in Vox, it’s a matter of the muddled picture of public opinion we have. For others, though, abandoning data centers would be like surrendering their raison d’être. Particularly for the groups that emerged out of the “progress studies” movement kick-started by Collison and Cowen’s <i>Atlantic</i> essay, part of the point of abundance has always been to foster a sense of techno-optimism.</p>
<p>There is nothing inherent to abundance thought that necessitates AI boosterism. Indeed on a <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/593-austin-ahlman-and-ben-winsor-seven-hard-lessons/id1474687988?i=1000749405346">recent podcast</a>, Marshall Kosloff, who emceed Abundance 2025, recalled responding to a question about what the abundance line on AI is: “We want nothing to do with that.” As Austin Ahlman of the Open Markets Institute, one of Kosloff’s guests for the episode, pointed out, such sentiment is “nowhere close to where the status quo is,” where Silicon Valley elites clearly “view this as an easy vehicle for the regulatory structures that they need to very quickly do the AI buildout without any democratic discipline or oversight.”</p>
<p>In fact, in its “Abundance Landscape” <a href="https://iai-website-storage-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/upload/abundance_landscape/pdf/Abundance%20Landscape%20Analysis.pdf">report</a>, Inclusive Abundance identifies artificial intelligence as one of the five core policy areas. Notably, transit, one of the most common talking points for abundance punditry, is excluded, though IA said it would include it in its 2026 report. Even outside of AI’s own dedicated policy area, the report also includes AI as one of the “opportunities” for abundance energy policy, saying “AI industry leaders and experts agree that this technology will need a tremendous amount of energy going forward. AI and energy experts must collaborate in order to meet the need for more energy.” A similar argument was made by Trembath in an <a href="https://heatmap.news/ideas/abundance-additionality-permitting-reform">article</a> with Josh Smith of the Abundance Institute. The Abundance Institute itself has also pushed AI very aggressively, including <a href="https://abundance.institute/our-work/development-of-an-ai-action-plan">encouraging</a> the White House to attempt to preempt all state-level regulation via executive order.</p>
<p>In a bit of profound irony, data-center construction has broken free of the choke points decried by abundance to the point that it is now bidding up land value and resulting in further constraints on the supply of housing, according to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/real-estate/data-center-land-deals-housing-shortage-81ea6e09?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqewmcsa4OgpjQRE2xG1Qw-EbdjhbyGU7DROExTrOCwL04tp4P9Mdf73hqXahN4%3D&amp;gaa_ts=6995f9fd&amp;gaa_sig=y68H3hELvx_enwyjYedK18J6O9dTreOOHMVke43-VUjk0FwGI1eylpMt-b-EEhp0Cn936iXh66N1t0C0t1vMzg%3D%3D">reporting</a> from <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>. Now the data-center buildout, as well as being deeply unpopular and undermining the intellectual case for abundance, is directly jeopardizing what is supposed to be the movement’s central animating goal.</p>
<p>Elements of abundance raise important questions, particularly about how to build state capacity and the importance of government efficiency to public buy-in for ambitious governance (articulated well in <a href="https://www.theringer.com/podcasts/plain-english-with-derek-thompson/2025/06/23/nyc-mayoral-candidate-zohran-mamdani-on-abundance-socialism-and-how-to-change-a-mind">this podcast</a> by Mayor Zohran Mamdani speaking to Derek Thompson). But the framing of these questions is also saddled with an association with the excesses of ambition of Silicon Valley moguls—and their dark, antidemocratic leanings. If it’s hard to get people to say yes to an apartment building in their backyard, it’s doubly so to convince them to site a giant warehouse spewing toxic emissions and spiking their electrical bills in their backyard—especially if the best non-bubblish case for the data center is that it will increase the odds they will be unemployed.</p>
