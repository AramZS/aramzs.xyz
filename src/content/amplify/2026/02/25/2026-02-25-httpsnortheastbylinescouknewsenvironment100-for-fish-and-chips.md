<p><strong>On a cold Friday evening, the queue snakes out of the chip shop and onto the pavement. Vinegar in the air. Salt shaken generously. A ritual as much as rain is British.</strong></p>
<p>Fish and chips have always felt permanent; reliable; ours.</p>
<p>But what happens when the humble cod in that paper wrapping is quietly becoming a luxury item? What if the £10 takeaway we barely think about becomes £20… £40… £100? It sounds ridiculous. It isn’t.</p>
<h2><strong>The fish we don’t catch anymore</strong></h2>
<p>Britain no longer feeds itself from its own seas.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.seafish.org/insight-and-research/seafood-trade-data/">The UK is now heavily dependent on imported seafood, with official trade statistics showing imports far exceed domestic landings,</a> according to Seafish trade data. The cod that defines the nation’s favourite dish now largely comes from Norway, Iceland and the Barents Sea – not the North Sea.</p>
<p>The reason is simple and uncomfortable. We fished our own waters down.</p>
<p>Atlantic cod stocks in the North Sea collapsed in the late 20th century after decades of heavy exploitation. International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) assessments show <a href="https://www.ices.dk/advice">dramatic declines</a> in spawning biomass through the 1980s and 1990s. While strict quotas have stabilised some stocks, they remain a shadow of its historic abundance.</p>
<p>The North Sea, once one of the richest fishing grounds in the world, can no longer reliably supply Britain’s appetite.</p>
<h2><strong>The diesel beneath the batter</strong></h2>
<p>Fish is not just a product of the sea. It is a product of fuel. Fishing vessels are diesel-powered vehicles. <a href="https://www.oecd.org/agriculture/topics/fisheries-and-aquaculture/">Fuel is widely recognised</a> as one of the largest operating cost components in commercial fishing fleets.</p>
<p>When stocks thin out, boats travel further offshore. They spend longer at sea. They burn more fuel for every tonne landed. That cost doesn’t disappear. It moves through the system- from vessel, to wholesaler, to fryer, to you. Between 2021 and 2023, fish and chip shops across the UK reported significant <a href="https://www.nfff.co.uk/">increases in input costs</a> driven by energy spikes, diesel inflation and cooking oil shortages. The price board crept up.</p>
<p>Most customers blamed inflation. Few connected it to ecology.</p>

<h2><strong>The sea Is warming and fish are moving</strong></h2>
<p>The North Sea has warmed over recent decades. The Marine Climate Change Impacts Partnership (MCCIP) reports <a href="https://www.mccip.org.uk/sites/default/files/2021-07/mccip-report-card-2020_webversion.pdf">increasing sea surface temperatures</a> across UK shelf seas including the North Sea.</p>
<p>MCCIP also documents <a href="https://www.mccip.org.uk/sites/default/files/2021-07/16_fish_2020.pdf">changes in fish populations and distribution</a> linked to warming waters. Species such as cod, mackerel and herring appear to be shifting northwards as waters heat up.</p>
<p>As fish follow warmer temperatures, boats must follow the fish. This creates a cycle of rising fuel costs, unpredictable fishing grounds and higher risks.</p>
<h2><strong>A globalised plate</strong></h2>
<p>The fish on your plate may have travelled thousands of miles.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.seafish.org/insight-and-research/seafood-trade-data/">Seafish trade data</a>, the UK imported over 1.1 million tonnes of seafood in 2023 with China supplying 171,311 tonnes, followed by Norway and Iceland. <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11160-025-09942-x">Long-term trade analysis</a> shows substantial regional diversification in UK seafood sourcing over the past century. Seafood is now part of a global commodity system. When exchange rates swing, shipping routes clog; geopolitical tensions flare up; energy prices spike; food prices respond quickly.</p>
<h2><strong>How scarcity creeps up on us</strong></h2>
<p>Scarcity doesn’t arrive with a trumpet. It arrives quietly through smaller catches, longer trips, thinner margins, higher insurance costs and tighter quotas. Then one day the price board jumps.</p>
<p>History shows this pattern clearly. Lobster was once so abundant it was fed to prisoners and servants. Today it is a luxury item. Abundance makes food ordinary.</p>
<p>Scarcity makes it premium. Fish and chips only felt permanent because fish once felt endless. It isn’t.</p>
<h2><strong>Could it really hit £100?</strong></h2>
<p>Not next year.</p>
<p>But imagine this chain of events:</p>
<p>• Cod stocks remain fragile<br/>
• Carbon pricing increases fuel costs<br/>
• Climate shifts intensify<br/>
• Imports face geopolitical disruption<br/>
• Sustainability quotas tighten further</p>
<p>Wholesale prices spike. Retail margins stretch. Compliance costs rise. Suddenly fish is no longer the cheapest protein on the menu.A £100 portion is not tomorrow’s forecast. It is a stress test of a system under strain. When ecosystems degrade faster than they recover, the market eventually reflects that reality.</p>
<h2><strong>The real shock</strong></h2>
<p>The true shock isn’t a three-digit price tag; it’s this: by the time fish costs £100, the collapse will already have happened. Seabeds will have been scraped for decades, hollowing out coastal communities.</p>
<p>Fish and chips survived war and rationing, but it cannot survive ecological exhaustion. If we continue treating the sea as an infinite warehouse rather than a living system, the market will do what policy has avoided. It will ration by price, and when that happens, we will finally realise something simple: the sea was never guaranteed. It was borrowed.</p>
