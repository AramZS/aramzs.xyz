<p>The health-conscious and sober-curious are cutting back on cocktails and beer, but one buzz-inducing beverage has been climbing the charts: THC drinks, in flavors ranging from ginger lemon grass to tangerine.</p>
<div>Consumers have flocked to drinks like   <a data-type="company" href="https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/AU/XASX/CAN">Cann</a>, Wynk and Nowadays since they started hitting liquor stores and gas stations in recent years, helping build a market that research firm Whitney Economics has estimated at $1 billion to $1.3 billion in annual sales. Unlike marijuana joints and edibles, THC beverages can be sold in most states because their THC content is derived from hemp. </div><p></p>
<div>Now they are in danger of going extinct. The federal spending law enacted in November included language effectively   <a data-type="link" href="https://www.wsj.com/business/congress-created-a-market-for-a-new-kind-of-cannabis-drink-now-it-wants-to-ban-it-db2f6e40?mod=article_inline">banning hemp-derived THC drinks</a> and other products later this year. </div><p></p>
<p>That has left entrepreneurs like Jake Bullock with months to save their businesses.</p>
<p>Bullock, who co-founded Cann from his parents’ basement seven years ago, has been making the rounds in Washington, lobbying lawmakers for an extension. Cann and other THC drink companies hope to set up a legal framework that would let them keep selling their drinks, including taxation and a federally established minimum purchasing age.</p>

<p>Since launching, Venice Beach, Calif.-based Cann has sold roughly 33.4 million of its beverages across more than 30 states, with sales growing by 46% last year. The federal clampdown means that hemp-based THC beverages have to be off shelves by Nov. 12, but without a solution in Washington, Bullock expects Cann’s sales to dry up after July, as buyers look to avoid amassing excess inventory ahead of the ban.</p>
<p>“Having built this category from the ground up it feels like extra pressure on us to keep it alive,” Bullock said. “We have to survive for these Cann drinkers.”</p>
<p>As he makes the rounds on Capitol Hill, Bullock is asking lawmakers to give the hemp-based products the chance to be regulated similarly to alcohol. If products like Cann’s are outlawed, he said, bad actors will find a way to keep selling them.</p>
<h3 data-type="hed">Buzz kill</h3>
<p>Cann and other hemp-derived THC companies were launched after the 2018 Farm Bill legalized commercial cultivation of hemp, a policy championed by Sen. Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.). The bill legalized all parts of the hemp plant, including derivatives and cannabinoids, allowing for the creation of hemp-derived THC products, including gummies and beverages.</p>
<div>That also meant they could be sold in most U.S. states, regardless of whether those states have legalized traditional marijuana—setting in motion what has become a   <a data-type="link" href="https://www.wsj.com/health/wellness/you-can-drink-your-weed-now-what-to-know-about-thc-beverages-e4def753?mod=article_inline">fast-growing industry</a>. While marijuana naturally has more of the intoxicating compound THC, hemp contains trace amounts that can be chemically concentrated into potent extracts. </div><p></p>
<p>Bullock is a former private-equity investor who became intrigued by THC beverages as an alcohol alternative. He decided to enter the business himself, initially moving into the basement of his parents’ home to help start Cann, which he calls a “social tonic” company. From Southern California, Cann expanded across the state and eventually to others, including Illinois and Nevada.</p>

<p>Opponents have decried what they say is a largely unchecked market that has allowed synthetically derived THC products to be widely sold. Parents’ groups and public health organizations warn that children could buy them, and some critics say hemp-derived THC beverages and gummies have been sold alongside candy in supermarkets.</p>
<p>Even in states that have strictly regulated the products, CADCA, previously known as Community Anti-Drug Coalitions of America, and other groups said they have found “youth access, misleading marketing, and persistent public health harms.”</p>
<p>Alcohol makers have pushed to ban the products, as hemp-derived THC beverages have dented already waning alcohol sales. Many legal marijuana businesses have also advocated for closing what they see as the Farm Bill loophole, saying hemp-derived THC companies need to start facing regulations.</p>
<p>Cory Harris, a lobbyist for regulated cannabis businesses, said that the hemp-derived THC industry “isn’t agreeing to play by the rules.”</p>
<p>The last-minute amendment to last fall’s spending bill was ushered through by McConnell, who has called the spread of hemp-derived THC products an unintended byproduct of the 2018 Farm Bill. The amendment rewrote the federal definition of hemp in a way that limits THC drinks and other hemp-derived products to contain significantly lower levels of THC.</p>
<h3 data-type="hed">Beltway blitz</h3>
<p>Bullock’s calendar is now packed back to back with Beltway meetings. Diana Eberlein, chair of the Coalition for Adult Beverage Alternatives, an advocacy group for THC beverages, said the ranks of lobbyists pushing for the industry have grown fivefold since November.</p>
<p>“A number of brands hired multiple lobbyists and we’ve been collaborating and making sure that we’re doing things complimentarily,” said Eberlein. She often lobbies alongside Bullock and executives from other THC beverage makers, including Climbing Kites and Nowadays.</p>

<p>Meetings with federal lawmakers and their staff have taken up some of Bullock’s time in recent months, along with members of the House of Representatives and their staff. Kentucky’s Sen. Rand Paul last fall proposed an amendment to the spending bill that would have blocked the ban on intoxicating hemp products, but it failed in a 76-24 vote.</p>
<p>Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have already proposed bills that would either extend the ban’s effective date or establish a federal framework for hemp-derived THC products. Bullock and other THC beverage executives are hunting for a legislative lifeline as their eight-month shot clock ticks down.</p>
<p>“With the rules the way they are right now, it’s a death sentence to move forward,” said Angus Rittenburg, CEO of THC beverage maker Wynk.</p>
