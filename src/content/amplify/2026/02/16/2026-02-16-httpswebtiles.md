<h2>What is this?</h2>
<p>Tiles are composable web docs and apps that can safely be used in arbitrary contexts and assembled from multiple sources to carry out complex user interface tasks. Their composability, security, and privacy properties make them ideal for use in social media, chat, agents, and malleable software.</p>
<p>Building on the <a href="https://dasl.ing/">DASL</a> specification toolbox brings the power of content addressing to tiles, and makes them excellent for use in contexts such as the <a href="https://atproto.com/">AT Protocol</a>.</p>
<p>For JS environments, there's a whole box of tools that you can use to support and manipulate tiles in the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dasl/tiles"><code>@dasl/tiles</code></a> package.</p>
<h2>Tell Me More!</h2>
<p>We don't have many demos ready just yet, but the easiest way to find out more is still to go load a tile in the <a href="https://webtil.es/browser/">tile browser</a> which we provide on this site. That page also offers <a href="https://webtil.es/browser/#tutorial">a very simple tutorial</a> that will get you to write and publish your first tile to the AT protocol in a matter of minutes.</p>
<p>For those who want to find out more about the nitty gritty, you can go read <a href="https://dasl.ing/tiles.html">the Web Tiles specification</a>. Like other DASL specs, it's intended to be simple and composed of basic components that are easy to understand and reuse.</p>
