<p>A couple of months ago, I had an idea: what if I built my own AT Protocol app?</p>
<p>I was browsing atproto app directories and thought: what if I made something like Hypothes.is, but more social and feature-rich?</p>
<p>That idea became Margin.</p>
<p>The initial design focused on annotating, highlighting, bookmarking, and collecting content.</p>
<p>I liked the concept, so I started building it.</p>
<p>Once the app was fairly usable, I announced it, and the word spread fast. People were excited about a new AT Protocol app, which gave me a huge motivation boost.</p>
<p>A few days later, I started invite-only pre-testing. Features were tested, bugs were found, and eventually, The first version of Margin was released.</p>
<h3 data-index="11">Browser Extension</h3>
<p>With support from the community, I was able to fund a Chrome Developer account and started working on the Margin browser extension.</p>
<p>It began as a simple, raw extension with no framework, but later we migrated to wxt.dev to make it more modular and maintainable.</p>
<p><a href="https://wxt.dev"><figure><img alt="Next-gen Web Extension Framework – WXT" src="https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:rjqn3agdb74cszhqcpii4sne/bafkreiaqmcz7svjmjmtjmflijcjql7vlzabks734362jqo3favusqqs73y@jpeg"/><figcaption><a href="https://wxt.dev">Next-gen Web Extension Framework – WXT</a></figcaption></figure></a></p>
<p>The AT Protocol has been really fun to work with, and interoperability with Semble showed how powerful it can be.</p>
<h3 data-index="16">Conclusion</h3>
<p>That’s how Margin came to life, through feedback, feature requests, and community support.</p>
<p>I’m excited to see where Margin goes next.</p>
