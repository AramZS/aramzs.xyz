<h1>Billionaires’ Low Taxes Are Becoming a Problem for the Economy</h1>
<h2>Tax avoidance by the superwealthy is an economic issue as well as a political one</h2>

<p>California’s plan to hit its richest residents with a one-off wealth tax is a long shot, and its design has problems. But a look at who picks up the tab when billionaires scrimp on taxes, and how wealth concentration is affecting the wider economy, shows why the issue isn’t going away.</p>
<p>The risk is that the U.S. economy becomes increasingly dependent on a narrow group of very rich households, whose spending is tied to the performance of the stock market. This could mean the entire economy pays a steep price in the next market correction.</p>
<p>California has the highest concentration of billionaires in the U.S. with 255 individuals, or slightly more than a fifth of <a href="https://www.wsj.com/finance/investing/what-we-know-about-americas-billionaires-1-135-and-counting-98d22268?mod=article_inline">the country’s billionaire population</a>, data from wealth-intelligence firm Altrata shows.</p>
<p>Federal cuts to the state’s Medicaid program will leave its health system short of billions of dollars. A California healthcare union wants an emergency, one-time 5% levy on the wealth of any resident worth over $1 billion to plug the hole.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/california-billionaire-wealth-tax-7f2f8f2e?mod=article_inline">The proposal</a> still needs to get enough signatures to qualify for a ballot in November, and a majority of voters would then need to approve it. Problems are already appearing with its design. The levy will be calculated based on whichever is the higher of a billionaire’s voting interest or economic interest in a company. The Tax Foundation says this could hurt tech founders, whose supervoting shares can be many multiples of their economic interest, resulting in outsize tax bills.</p>
<p>Wealth taxes are hard to administer, and the ultrarich can simply leave if they don’t like where a state’s tax policies are headed. Google co-founder Sergey Brin recently left California. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/PLTR">Palantir</a> co-founder Peter Thiel says he might follow. Worries about California’s billionaires leaving and taking jobs with them may be enough to turn voters against the initiative.</p>

<p>But debate about how much tax billionaires pay is likely to grow as America’s fiscal situation deteriorates and its wealth gap widens. Data from the Federal Reserve shows that only the richest 1% of households have grown their share of overall U.S. wealth since 1990. Their share hit a record 32% in the third quarter of 2025, equivalent to $54.8 trillion.</p>
<p>Gains made by the billionaire class, the very top 0.1% of households and a subset of the 1%, have eclipsed the merely extremely rich. This group’s share of U.S. net wealth has risen nearly 6 percentage points to 14.4% since 1990.</p>
<p>The impacts of this are visible in <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/retail/why-jewelry-is-outperforming-the-rest-of-the-luxury-world-4010930b?mod=article_inline">booming sales at businesses that cater to the ultrarich</a>. Wealth concentration is so intense that it is even causing a divergence among luxury-goods companies: Brands such as Cartier or <a href="https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/FR/XPAR/RMS">Hermès</a> that cater to the superwealthy are soaring, while sales at labels that rely on affluent middle-class consumers are slack.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the bottom half of American households have lost ground. Their 2.5% cut of the country’s wealth has slipped from 3.5% in 1990. Also striking: The share owned by the decile of wealthy households that rank just below the top 1% has shrunk slightly.</p>
<p>The tax code may be one reason why billionaire households have raced so far ahead of mere millionaires. One argument used to push back against calls for the rich to pay more into the system is that 1% of the highest earners pay 40% of income taxes, while 40% of Americans pay no income tax at all. This is true, but billionaires aren’t captured by this picture because most of their wealth lies outside the income-tax system.</p>
<p>Billionaires have ways to lower their tax bills that aren’t available to most Americans. A common strategy is to avoid salaries, which are heavily taxed. Ray Madoff, a law professor at Boston College and author of The Second Estate: How the Tax Code Made an American Aristocracy, points to Mark Zuckerberg’s dollar-a-year wage at Meta. Warren Buffett took an annual salary of $100,000 for decades.</p>
<p>Billionaires prefer to be paid in shares, which are subject to capital-gains taxes when sold. But they don’t need to sell to fund their lifestyles. Billionaires use borrowed money for living expenses, pledging their shares or other assets as collateral. The interest on the debt is much lower than a capital-gains tax bill would be, and their stock portfolios can continue accumulating paper gains.</p>
<p>One-third of America’s billionaires have inherited their wealth. The ultrarich can use structures such as dynasty trusts to shield their assets from estate taxes for generations, while the step-up provision adjusts the cost basis of an inherited asset to its fair market value.</p>
<p>Amassing assets like stocks, borrowing against them rather than selling during the owner’s lifetime, and passing them to the next generation after death is sometimes called the “buy borrow die” tax-avoidance strategy.</p>
<p>Billionaires put less into the tax pot as a percentage of their wealth than wage earners. One working paper by the National Bureau of Economic Research found that the effective tax rate for the U.S.’s 400 wealthiest individuals is 24%—compared with 45% for top labor income earners.</p>
<p>“Very well-off Americans with high incomes have come to see themselves in the same camp as the very rich, even though their interests align much more with the middle class,” says Boston College’s Madoff.</p>
<p>Wealth concentration is increasingly clear in economic data. The top fifth of wealthiest households now account for nearly 60% of personal outlays, up from 50% in the early 1990s, data from Moody’s shows.</p>
<p>Thiel sent a $3 million check to a lobbying group that is trying to defeat the California billionaire-tax initiative. This latest plan to soak the rich might not be too hard to beat.</p>
<p>But the very fact of the rising concentration of wealth in the hands of the superwealthy means the issue of how to tax it won’t be going away, and pressure could build for ever-more populist measures, including at the national level. In the meantime, expect businesses that cater to billionaires to outperform those aiming at everyone else.</p>
