<p>Iron Lung</p>
<p>Iron Lung</p>
<p><em>This article was written on 2/2 and republished on 2/4.</em></p>
<p>Whether it’s the triumphant return of Sam Raimi or the exceptionally divisive <em>Melania</em> documentary, there are multiple box office stories to cover this weekend, but the most impressive is what’s happened with <em>Iron Lung.</em></p>
<p>The movie, entirely self-financed by YouTube legend Mark “Markiplier” Fischbach, gave <em>Send Help</em> a run for its money, <a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl3918299137/?ref_=bo_hm_RECENT_WEEKEND_WIDGET_2">earning</a> $17.8 million to its $20 million, but <em>Iron Lung</em> also made $21.7 million in total worldwide ( <a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl4147019777/?ref_=bo_hm_RECENT_WEEKEND_WIDGET_1"><em>Send Help</em></a> <em>,</em> $28 million). But something strange happened when Markiplier noted that <em>Iron Lung</em> had been erased on a number of box office charts, which only showed <em>Send Help</em> and <em>Melania</em> instead:</p>
<p>Twitter Embed</p>
<p>Twitter Widget Iframe</p>
<p>PROMOTED</p>
<p>This quickly created a narrative of “the mainstream is trying to keep independent film/YouTubers down!” though it seems unlikely that was the case, and it was probably just a glitch. <em>Iron Lung</em> appears to be back in second place across all charts I can see, including the most widely cited one, <a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekend/2026W05/?ref_=bo_hm_rw">Box Office Mojo</a>, where I never saw it vanish in the first place as I tracked it over the weekend.</p>
<p>Even though <em>Send Help</em> took first at the box office, <em>Iron Lung,</em> at least so far, is technically the biggest success. <em>Iron Lung,</em> again, self-financed by Markiplier, reportedly did not cost more that $3 million. Making $21.7 million in its first weekend would be roughly seven times its budget. Low-budget horror has been known to break out and earn a lot of money for relatively little investment, but it’s far from a guarantee. <em>Send Help,</em> meanwhile, reportedly cost $40 million.</p>

<p>Iron Lung</p>
<p>Markiplier</p>
<p>It is a little ironic, as you can compare what’s happening here to the movie adaptation of a game that put Markiplier fully on the map, <em>Five Nights At Freddy’s.</em> That too was underestimated by box-office forecasters and ended up grossing $291 million worldwide on a reported $20 million budget. Almost a 15x multiplier. If <em>Iron Lung</em> is already at 7x in one weekend. This was originally planned as a fairly limited release, but “demand” expanded it to 3,000 theaters, where it was able to rack up these numbers.</p>

<p>Here’s the synopsis of <em>Iron Lung</em> if you’re not familiar:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“In a post-apocalyptic future after "The Quiet Rapture" event, a convict explores a blood ocean on a desolate moon using a submarine called the "Iron Lung" to search for missing stars/planets.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Depending on how the year pans out, it’s possible that at least in the context of its budget and exceptionally limited marketing, <em>Iron Lung</em> could be considered one of its biggest box office success stories. It also may represent a future of filmmaking where more creators dabble in the space and drag their fanbases along with them (see this already happening with Mr. Beast and his Amazon Game Show). Clearly, it has worked out fantastically for Markiplier so far.</p>
<p><strong>Update (2/4):</strong> Checking back in on Iron Lung, it has once again been removed from box office charts. But this time, not by accident.</p>
<p>Not everyone may realize this, but Iron Lung was only meant to be in theaters for this past weekend. While it was originally a limited release in terms of the number of theaters carrying it, which expanded to 3,000+, that did not extend to a long theatrical run. That’s a different level of release, and one that Iron Lung had not planned.</p>
<p>Buuuut, guess what? Markiplier has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFaihZ0f58w">announced</a> that Iron Lung, though not airing this week during the weekdays, will in fact return to theaters this coming Friday, allowing fans another chance to see it if they haven’t already, and it will be added to its box office total of $20.8 million. Iron Lung is already listed at my local theaters with three showtimes on Friday. It appears it will probably get fewer screens than before, but that’s unclear right now.</p>
<p>After this, there will also be PVOD, where Iron Lung will be able to make even more money. What its total will be at this point isn’t known, but it is already a huge success, and that will only snowball further this coming weekend.</p>
