<h1>Billionaires’ Low Taxes Are Becoming a Problem for the Economy</h1>
<h2>Tax avoidance by the superwealthy is an economic issue as well as a political one</h2>

<p>California’s plan to hit its richest residents with a one-off wealth tax is a long shot, and its design has problems. But a look at who picks up the tab when billionaires scrimp on taxes, and how wealth concentration is affecting the wider economy, shows why the issue isn’t going away.</p>
<p>The risk is that the U.S. economy becomes increasingly dependent on a narrow group of very rich households, whose spending is tied to the performance of the stock market. This could mean the entire economy pays a steep price in the next market correction.</p>
<p>California has the highest concentration of billionaires in the U.S. with 255 individuals, or slightly more than a fifth of <a href="https://www.wsj.com/finance/investing/what-we-know-about-americas-billionaires-1-135-and-counting-98d22268?mod=article_inline">the country’s billionaire population</a>, data from wealth-intelligence firm Altrata shows.</p>
<p>Federal cuts to the state’s Medicaid program will leave its health system short of billions of dollars. A California healthcare union wants an emergency, one-time 5% levy on the wealth of any resident worth over $1 billion to plug the hole.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/california-billionaire-wealth-tax-7f2f8f2e?mod=article_inline">proposal</a> still needs to get enough signatures to qualify for a ballot in November, and a majority of voters would then need to approve it. Problems are already appearing with its design. The levy will be calculated based on whichever is the higher of a billionaire’s voting interest or economic interest in a company. The Tax Foundation says this could hurt tech founders, whose supervoting shares can be many multiples of their economic interest, resulting in outsize tax bills.</p>
<p>Wealth taxes are hard to administer, and the ultrarich can simply leave if they don’t like where a state’s tax policies are headed. Google co-founder Sergey Brin recently left California. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/PLTR">Palantir</a> co-founder Peter Thiel says he might follow. Worries about California’s billionaires leaving and taking jobs with them may be enough to turn voters against the initiative.</p>
