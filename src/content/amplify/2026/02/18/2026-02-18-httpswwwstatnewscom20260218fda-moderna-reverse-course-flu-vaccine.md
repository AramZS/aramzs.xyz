<p>WASHINGTON — The Food and Drug Administration reversed course and told Moderna it would review its application for a new flu vaccine, the company announced Wednesday.</p>
<p>The agency told Moderna earlier this month that it would not review the submission because of a dispute over the design of a clinical trial. The decision was made by top FDA official Vinay Prasad, who STAT previously reported had <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2026/02/11/moderna-flu-vaccine-application-rejected-by-prasad-overruling-fda-staff/">overruled</a> career scientists in the vaccine center.</p>
<p>Moderna is trying to secure approval for an mRNA flu vaccine for adults 50 and older. The FDA will now review the product in adults 50 to 64 through a regular pathway, and adults over 65 via accelerated approval with a requirement to run a post-marketing study. The agency will aim to review the vaccine by Aug. 5.</p>
