<h2 data-gu-name="standfirst">String of embarrassing defeats for prosecutors as experts condemn DoJ effort to cast people as ‘violent perpetrators’</h2>
<p>Department of Justice prosecutors across the US have suffered a string of embarrassing defeats in their aggressive pursuit of criminal cases against people accused of “assaulting” and “impeding” federal officers.</p>
<p>In recent months, the federal government has relentlessly prosecuted protesters, government critics, immigrants and others arrested during immigration operations, often accusing them of physically attacking officers or interfering with their duties.</p>
<p>But many of those cases have recently been dismissed or ended in not guilty verdicts.</p>
<p>In several high-profile cases, the prosecutions fell apart because they relied on statements by Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officers that had no supporting evidence or in some instances were proven by video footage to be blatantly false.</p>
<p>Criminal defense lawyers said it was unusual for federal prosecutors to pursue a high volume of charges over minor clashes with law enforcement, and that it was extraordinary to see the DoJ lose case after case across jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Still, the costs for defendants, even if ultimately exonerated, have been enormous, with many having their mugshots blasted by the government and some forced to languish in jail or have criminal charges hang over them for weeks and months.</p>
<h2>‘Casting victims as perpetrators’</h2>
<p>The most recent significant fumble came from Minneapolis prosecutors, who last week <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/feb/13/justice-department-moves-to-drop-charges-alfredo-alejandro-aljorna-julio-cesar-sosa-celis-ice-minnesota">dismissed felony assault charges</a> they had filed against two Venezuelan men <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.dhs.gov/news/2026/01/15/dhs-releases-more-details-about-three-violent-criminal-illegal-aliens-who-violently">accused</a> of “violently beating” an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer “with weapons” on 14 January.</p>
<p>In a press release issued after their arrest, the DHS had described the men as “violent criminal illegal aliens”. The department said officers were conducting a targeted traffic stop to detain an undocumented man from Venezuela, and as he “began to resist and violently assault the officer”, two other men came out of a nearby apartment and “attacked the law enforcement officer with a snow shovel and broom handle”. The officer shot one of them in the leg.</p>
<p>Two of the men were arrested and charged, with a 16 January affidavit providing a vivid account of them attacking an officer identified as ERO 1, referring to ICE’s enforcement and removal operations. But on 12 February, prosecutors filed a motion to dismiss both men’s cases, saying: “Newly discovered evidence in this matter is materially inconsistent with the allegations in the complaint affidavit.”</p>
<p>The motion, which a judge granted, sought to have the cases dismissed “with prejudice”, meaning the government could not re-file charges.</p>
<p>ICE director Todd Lyons said ICE and the DoJ had <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/feb/13/ice-officers-minneapolis">opened an investigation</a> into the case after videos revealed “sworn testimony provided by two separate officers appears to have made untruthful statements”, marking a rare acknowledgement of possible wrongdoing by DHS officials.</p>
<p>“It is very unusual for the government to move to dismiss its own case with prejudice,” Frederick Goetz, a lawyer for one of the men, said in an interview. He praised the government for launching investigations: “If you make false statements to a federal agent, that is a crime.”</p>
<p>Goetz said there were other similar cases stemming from the DHS’s “<a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2026/jan/21/minneapolis-ice-surge-siege">Operation Metro Surge</a>” in the Minneapolis-St Paul region: “Anecdotally, you see a pattern: there are unreasonable uses of force by ICE agents and border patrol. You immediately have stories perpetuated to justify that force: ‘The officer was being attacked. This was an ambush.’ All of that spin is to cast the victims as violent perpetrators. Then the story falls apart once you get the facts.”</p>

<p>He said it would be difficult to undo the reputational harm done to his client: “The allegation that he was a violent criminal who attacked a federal officer with a broom – that image and association is going to live for ever on the internet. It traveled all the way to Venezuela. It’s absolutely not who he is.”</p>
<p>Goetz, a federal criminal defense lawyer in Minnesota for nearly 40 years, said the high volume of similar charges tied to Trump’s immigration crackdown had further consequences. It was <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/feb/04/ice-attorney-minnesota-removed-after-court-statement">overwhelming the federal courts</a> in the state, diverting resources from the traditional work of federal prosecutors, such as complex fraud, drug and gang matters: “Public safety has not been served by these rash of cases.”</p>
<p>The case is one of several in Minnesota that has fallen apart. Earlier this year, Minnesota federal prosecutors <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.fox21online.com/2026/01/26/case-dismissed-for-man-arrested-in-virginia-ice-operation/">dropped</a> assault charges against a man, who was accused of ramming his car into agents during an immigration operation. The DoJ <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/26/us/politics/justice-dept-drops-charges-assault-officer.html">presented no witnesses</a> to establish probable cause.</p>
<p>And on Tuesday, a judge dismissed with prejudice federal assault charges filed against a Minneapolis man <a data-link-name="in body link" href="http://google.com/url?q=https://www.fox9.com/news/minneapolis-man-accused-tackling-ice-agent-during-monday-protest&amp;sa=D&amp;source=docs&amp;ust=1771546813277069&amp;usg=AOvVaw0sLEDKgCyCgrBSk8321dDU">accused</a> of “tackling” an ICE agent on 15 December. The judge, Donovan Frank, noted the ICE officer was not injured and called the allegations “vague and contradictory”. Federal officers had reviewed multiple videos of the events, and, “None saw a ‘tackle’ or other kind of assault,” Frank said.</p>
<p>Prosecutors sought to have his case dismissed without prejudice, allowing them to later re-charge him. But the judge rejected that request, citing the defendant’s arguments that “future prosecution may be politically motivated” – a claim that, the judge noted, the government had not contested.</p>
<h2>‘A level of terror’</h2>
<p>US attorney’s offices across the country have faced similar obstacles and rebukes.</p>
<p>In Chicago, of 92 people arrested for assaulting or impeding officers last fall, 74 cases have resulted in no charges; in 13 cases, charges were filed and dismissed; and five charged cases were still pending, a <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.fox9.com/news/dhs-arrests-assaulting-ice-agents-rarely-charged-regularly-dismissed-jan-28">recent investigation</a> by Fox 9, a Minneapolis-based station, showed. As of the end of January, there have been no convictions.</p>
<p>In LA, the federal public defenders have won all six cases filed against ICE protesters that have gone to trial since June, the <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2026-02-06/federal-public-defenders-winning">LA Times recently reported</a>. Fewer than 1% of federal criminal defendants were acquitted across the US in fiscal year 2024, with US prosecutors traditionally having a roughly 90% conviction rate, the paper noted.</p>
<p>Juries have also issued not guilty verdicts for people accused of assaulting ICE or similar charges in <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/local/2026/02/06/louisville-man-not-guilty-assaulting-ice-officers/88534302007/?gnt-cfr=1&amp;gca-cat=p&amp;gca-uir=true&amp;gca-epti=z119353p118150c118150v119353d--xx--b--xx--&amp;gca-ft=34&amp;gca-ds=sophi">Louisville, Kentucky</a>, <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/law-justice/jury-acquits-stanwood-man-accused-of-assaulting-homeland-security-agents/">Seattle</a> and <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/06/man-threw-sandwich-agent-washington-not-guilty-verdict">Washington DC</a>.</p>
<p>“That losing streak is really unheard of,” said LA-based defense lawyer Katherine McBroom. She <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/feb/10/los-angeles-protester-jonathon-redondo-rosales">represented Jonathon Redondo-Rosales</a>, an LA protester who spent six months in jail until a federal judge dismissed his case with prejudice last week.</p>
<p>Redondo-Rosales was accused of assaulting an officer with a cloth hat. The judge noted discrepancies in the government’s account and that the alleged victim, an officer identified as ZC, had previously failed to disclose he was convicted of harassment. The DHS said last week the officer was under investigation.</p>
<p>McBroom said it appeared prosecutors were aware their case was weak as they downgraded charges from a felony to a misdemeanor, then repeatedly tried to negotiate pleas with increasingly favorable terms for her client: “The efforts to settle seemed desperate. It seemed like there was a concerted effort to prevent this from going to trial, because, while I can’t get into their heads, I don’t think they were confident in the case. It would take integrity to do the right thing and say we got this wrong. But they didn’t do that.”</p>
<p>After <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DU6jP7ckVCy/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1">footage was submitted in court</a> clearly demonstrating Redondo-Rosales had not hit the officer in the face with a “closed fist”, as the officer initially claimed, McBroom said she was shocked prosecutors continued to pursue a plea that would land her client a conviction: “We’re both looking at the video. How on earth are we interpreting it so differently?”</p>
<p>Ciaran McEvoy, a spokesperson for the US attorney’s office in Los Angeles, did not respond to questions about the specific cases, but shared data indicating that as of Friday, his office had filed charges against 103 people for assaulting or impeding federal officers or related allegations since last year. In addition to the six people acquitted at trial, 25 of those cases ended in dismissals and another 25 defendants pleaded guilty. The rest were pending.</p>
<p>Prosecutors have appealed against two of the dismissals, including in Redondo-Rosales’s case.</p>
<p>Representatives of the other US attorney’s offices and DoJ did not respond to detailed inquiries about the cases. Natalie Baldassarre, a DoJ spokesperson, said in an email the justice department would “continue to seek the most serious available charges against any individual who puts federal agents in harm’s way”.</p>
<p>“We will not tolerate any violence directed toward our brave law enforcement officials who are working tirelessly to keep Americans safe,” the statement continued. “Those who attack law enforcement will be held fully accountable for their actions, despite the best efforts of activist liberal judges who would rather see violent criminals walk free.”</p>
<p>The DHS did not respond to inquiries, and the White House declined to comment.</p>
<p>McBroom said the government was silencing free speech through a prosecution that depended on multiple officials repeating false statements. “There’s a level of terror to this, in that he was being held in jail for exercising his first amendment rights, and it was a collaborative effort to hide the truth that was keeping him in custody. It’s terrifying.”</p>
