<h2 data-gu-name="standfirst">Acting university president says agents misrepresented themselves to gain entry to the residential building </h2>
<p><a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/columbia-university">Columbia University</a> said on Thursday morning that one of its students was arrested by federal immigration officers who apparently misrepresented themselves to gain entry to a residential building to make the apprehension.</p>
<p>The acting president of the elite institution in <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-york">New York City</a>, Claire Shipman, wrote in a statement sent to the wider Columbia community on Thursday that the university was working to gather more information on the incident earlier that morning.</p>
<p>She did not identify the student or comment on their immigration status but said the university was working to reach the family and providing legal support.</p>
<p>However, the student in question was understood to be Ellie Aghayeva, an undergraduate student who <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.instagram.com/stories/ellharve/3841042582566939019/?hl=en">posted a photo</a> that appeared to show her own legs, possibly in a vehicle, in an Instagram story with the message: “Dhs illegally arrested me. Please help”.</p>
<p>Shipman’s statement continued: “Our understanding at this time is that the federal agents made misrepresentations to gain entry to the building to search for a ‘missing person’.”</p>
<p>She added: “It is important to reiterate that all law enforcement agents must have a judicial warrant or judicial subpoena to access non-public areas of the University. An administrative warrant is not sufficient.”</p>
<p>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) did not immediately respond to a request for comment, as <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/19/donald-trump-immigration-crackdown">the parent agency</a> of the main US federal immigration enforcement agencies Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and border patrol.</p>
<p>The arrest came nearly a year after upheaval on campus after immigration officials detained Columbia students <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/feb/12/mahmoud-khalil-deportation-fight">Mahmoud Khalil</a> and <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/feb/17/judge-mohsen-mahdawi">Mohsen Mahdawi</a>, both Palestinians with valid immigration status, in a crackdown on dissent against Israel’s military operations in <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza">Gaza</a>.</p>
<p>The <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> detained them and other foreign scholars whom it accused of no crimes but who had been outspoken in the cause of Palestinian rights. The government argued that their advocacy posed a threat to US national security and it would make efforts to deport such individuals<strong>.</strong></p>
<p>In a <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/30/trump-administration-immigration-palestine">blistering opinion</a> issued in September, a Boston federal judge found that their detention was unconstitutional and designed to chill speech.</p>
<p>Thursday’s incident sent fresh shock waves through the university’s campus and prompted plans for an emergency vigil on campus for noon.</p>
<p>In a joint <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://x.com/SpeakerMenin/status/2027043248724660436">statement</a>, New York city council speaker Julie Menin and council majority leader Shaun Abreu condemned the student’s detention.</p>
<p>“ICE has no place in our schools and universities,” they wrote. “These activities do not make our city or country safer, but rather drive mistrust and danger.”</p>
