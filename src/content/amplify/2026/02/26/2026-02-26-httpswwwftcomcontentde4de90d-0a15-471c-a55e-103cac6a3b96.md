title: The battle for the world’s most coveted elements
---
<h1>The battle for the world’s most coveted elements</h1>
<p>The elements of the periodic table that revolutionised chemistry as a scientific field more than 150 years ago are now at the heart of a momentous modern commercial and geopolitical battle.</p>
<p>The contest is playing out from corporate boardrooms planning mining megadeals to US efforts to form a “critical minerals” trade zone to counter China’s influence.</p>
<p>Dozens of the world’s nearly 100 naturally occurring elements are in growing demand for crucial industrial uses, making their supply expensive, prone to shortages or vulnerable to international tensions.</p>
<p>Much attention has been on <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a811c4dc-bb93-42aa-983a-4c0363073e37">rare earths</a>, which are used in green technologies and defence and are the focus of a new US stockpiling effort known as <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/972e460e-f214-42ab-aba3-a0a9900daabd">Project Vault</a>. China has most of the world’s supplies and has imposed curbs on exports.</p>
<p>But rare earths account for just a quarter of the 60 critical minerals listed by the <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/programs/mineral-resources-program/science/about-2025-list-critical-minerals">US Geological Survey</a> as having crucial uses. The US <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/0a27adbc-1c8b-4361-9c57-c9f7f53f49d3">launched</a> a drive this month to collaborate on critical minerals supplies, including with Japan and European countries, to curb China’s dominance.</p>
<h2>Industrial essentials</h2>
<p>The first set of elements are staple substances used in producing goods ranging from fighter jets to power plants. They figure prominently on most official critical minerals lists, from the US and the EU to Japan, China and South Korea.</p>
<p>Mastering supply chains of these elements, from mines to the factory floor, has become a matter of geostrategic importance in an age of trade and political confrontation. Supremacy in technologies such as microchips, electric vehicles and nuclear power are at the heart of the rivalry.</p>
<p>Elements in the periodic table are arranged in rows by ascending atomic number, meaning that those with similar properties line up in columns.</p>
<p>Substances including <strong>germanium</strong> and <strong>gallium</strong>, typically produced in industries China dominates, underpin semiconductors used in modern electronics and artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>A wider group of elements is used in aerospace and aeronautics, at a time when air traffic has rebounded after Covid-19 and militaries are retooling air defences.</p>
<p><strong>Palladium</strong> and <strong>platinum</strong> are part of the <strong>platinum</strong> grouping of metals, prized for their resistance to heat and corrosion in energy, transport and electronics.</p>
<p>Overall, the US Department of Energy forecasts the supply risk between 2025-35 to be <strong>critical</strong> for five of the elements in this class and <strong>near critical</strong> for two.</p>
<h2>China’s trump cards</h2>
<p>Some coveted minerals are not in global shortage, but mines or processing facilities are concentrated in a few countries — or one, most often China.</p>
<p>For example, the country dominates the rare earth elements used in green energy technologies, such as wind turbines. China has restricted rare earth supplies in response to disputes with Washington and its allies.</p>
<p>The rare earth elements include a trio crucial for making advanced magnets: <strong>praseodymium</strong>, <strong>neodymium</strong> and <strong>dysprosium</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Yttrium</strong> and <strong>terbium</strong> are versatile rare earth elements with wide-ranging uses, from display technologies to fibre optics.</p>
<p>China dominates the market for graphite, a form of <strong>carbon</strong>. Best known for use in pencil “lead”, graphite is also used in electric vehicle batteries and nuclear power generation.</p>
<p><strong>Lithium</strong> is in high demand for electric vehicle batteries and is abundant – but China hosts much of its processing.</p>
<p>Phosphates, containing the elements <strong>phosphorus</strong> and <strong>oxygen</strong>, are also increasingly important for EV batteries — and form a market where China leads.</p>
<p>The US Department of Energy forecasts the supply risk between 2025-35 to be <strong>critical</strong> for six of the elements in this class, including for <strong>lithium</strong> and the graphite form of <strong>carbon</strong>.</p>
<h2>Tomorrow’s prized elements</h2>
<p>There are some commonly found metals which could have steeper demand in the future.</p>
<p>One of those is <strong>copper</strong>, said Henry Sanderson, a fellow with the Royal United Services Institute and author of the book <em>Volt Rush</em>. “All of the big miners want more.”</p>
<p><strong>Copper</strong> is in growing demand because it conducts both electricity and heat well, making it key to data centres.</p>
<p>While <strong>sodium</strong> supplies are ample now, they could tighten if the element’s use in next-generation electric vehicle batteries works out.</p>
<p><strong>Silicon</strong> is prized for uses ranging from solar power to consumer products. China is the leading producer by far.</p>
<p>A revival in nuclear power — and the prospect of next generation fusion — could drive demand for elements such as <strong>boron</strong>, <strong>zirconium</strong>, <strong>hafnium</strong>, <strong>uranium</strong>, <strong>samarium</strong>, <strong>holmium</strong> and <strong>thulium</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Helium</strong>, familiar as the element that buoys party balloons, is crucial for extreme cooling, including for superconducting magnets such as those used in MRI scanners.</p>
<p><strong>Noble gases</strong> are vital to lighting and semiconductors, but supplies have been disrupted by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, as both countries are major producers.</p>
<p>The semiconductor <strong>silicon carbide</strong> is on the US Department of Energy’s <strong>critical</strong> list for 2025-35, while elemental <strong>silicon</strong>, <strong>copper</strong> and <strong>uranium</strong> are categorised as <strong>near critical</strong>.</p>
<p>Dmitri Mendeleev, the 19th-century Russian chemist who built the prototype for the modern periodic table, famously said the idea came to him in a dream. Now these same rows and columns of letters are the stuff of nightmares for policymakers charged with ensuring the uninterrupted supply of vital materials.</p>
