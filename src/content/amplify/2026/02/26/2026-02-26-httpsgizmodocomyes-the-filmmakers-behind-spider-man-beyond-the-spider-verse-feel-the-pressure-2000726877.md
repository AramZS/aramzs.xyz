<p>Way back in 2022, the team behind <em>Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse</em> had a plan. <a href="https://gizmodo.com/spider-man-across-the-spider-verse-has-been-delayed-1848821672">Release the first sequel,</a> <em>Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,</em> in the summer of 2023 and then, just a few short months later, close the trilogy in spring 2024. It was an ambitious plan that, as we now know, did not work out like that. <em>Across the Spider-Verse</em> came out in 2023 to <a href="https://gizmodo.com/spiderman-across-spider-verse-review-marvel-sony-animat-1850490027">wide critical acclaim</a>, but that created even more pressure, and <em>Beyond the Spider-Verse</em> was delayed. And delayed again. <a href="https://gizmodo.com/spider-man-beyond-the-spider-verse-release-date-2000583222">And again.</a></p>
<p>Eventually, that spring 2024 release date <a href="http://v">became summer 2027</a>, and, speaking to io9 about their latest movie, <em>Project Hail Mary, Spider-Verse</em> producers Phil Lord and Chris Miller told us a bit about how that happened.</p>
<p>“At one point it was one movie, but there was too much movie there, so it was separated into two,” Miller said. “But then once you looked at that second half of a movie, you’re like, ‘Well, that’s like not just a story arc that has a beginning, middle, and end.”</p>
<p>“We know where it’s headed, but we need to understand better what’s happening in the middle,” Lord added. “And we came upon a really wonderful notion, which is when your family is broken apart by your calling, your talents, how do you put them back together? How do you have it all?”</p>
<p>If<em> Beyond the Spider-Verse</em> lives up to the insane quality of the first two films upon release, fans will have it all, and Lord and Miller explain they are well aware of those pressures. “We put the most pressure on ourselves,” Miller said. “There’s no one that puts more pressure on us than ourselves, wanting to outdo ourselves each time and see things that you haven’t seen before and make it feel like something you’ve never experienced before. And so, trying to get something that is as worthy as the previous two has been the driver.”</p>
<p>“The main trick is to play free,” Lord added. “And to have the whole team understand that their job is to try stuff. To make mistakes, to see where this could go. And I can report that they’re going hard. It’s so great.”</p>
<p>But, as one might imagine, all that work and pressure are why the movie is taking so long. “Having to take it apart to put it back together again was really, really [the] real thing that made it take longer,” Miller said.</p>
<p>“And then we took a small detour,” Lord added.</p>
<p>Oh, right. That tiny little movie called <em>Project Hail Mary</em> that Lord and Miller directed in between, which comes to theaters on March 20. We’ll have more on that soon as we patiently await more on <em>Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse,</em> which is out on June 18, 2027.</p>
