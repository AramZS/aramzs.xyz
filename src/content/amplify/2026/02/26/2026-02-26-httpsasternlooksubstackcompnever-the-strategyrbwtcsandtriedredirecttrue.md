<p>Feb 10, 2026</p>
<p>On February 4, 2026, two very different things happened in U.S. media.</p>
<p>The New York Times reported full-year revenue of $2.83 billion, a 9% increase, and announced it had surpassed 12.8 million subscribers. The same day, The Washington Post laid off a third of its staff.</p>
<p>Within days, the Post’s CEO had resigned. He’d been photographed on a red carpet the day after announcing the cuts. His handpicked editor had withdrawn before starting. His signature initiative — a “third newsroom” — had been dismantled months earlier. The paper had lost $100 million in 2024.</p>
<p>In my last two essays here, I wrote about the <a href="https://asternlook.substack.com/p/the-change-tax">Change Tax</a> and the <a href="https://asternlook.substack.com/p/hollywood-bcg-and-the-military-have">Mission Operating Model</a>. I argued that most businesses that fail do so because of bad structure, not because of bad strategy. The Times and the Post proved it last week.</p>
<p>These two organizations should have had the exact same trajectory. Both are legacy American institutions with Pulitzer-winning traditions. The Sulzbergers have owned the Times since 1896. The Graham family steered the Post through the Pentagon Papers and Watergate (Meryl Streep starred as Katharine Graham in <em>The Post</em>). Both entered the digital era as dominant national brands with loyal audiences, institutional credibility, and the financial runway to transform. Both are facing identical headwinds: declining print circulation, AI-driven traffic erosion, news fatigue, political polarization.</p>
<p>One is thriving. The other is in crisis. The obvious question is what went wrong at the Post. The more useful question is why.</p>
<p><strong>What happened?</strong></p>
<p>The visible fallout at the Post is extensive. A compressed timeline:</p>
<p>Will Lewis arrived as CEO in January 2024 and told staff in June that “not enough of the public wanted to read their reporting.” He pushed out executive editor Sally Buzbee — the first woman to hold the role — on a Sunday evening with no advance warning to the newsroom. He replaced her with former colleagues from Murdoch-owned publications. His handpicked successor editor withdrew within three weeks after ethical concerns surfaced. He announced a “third newsroom” for service journalism that produced nothing before its leader took a buyout. He announced AI products that no one engaged with. He held no town hall after June 2024. In October, owner Jeff Bezos stopped the planned presidential endorsement and at least 250,000 subscribers cancelled. The opinion section was reoriented toward “personal liberties and free markets” — the opinion editor resigned, columnists departed, a cartoonist quit over censorship, and 75,000 more subscribers left. Then the mass layoffs. Then, three days later, Lewis himself was gone.</p>
<p>A staffer told the Columbia Journalism Review: “He’s started all these initiatives and then abandoned them almost immediately.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile at the Times: silence. Clean editorial transitions. More journalists on staff than ever before. Revenue accelerating. Subscriber targets hit ahead of schedule.</p>
<p>Most commentary frames the Post’s collapse as a leadership failure. Lewis was the wrong hire. Bezos lost interest. The newsroom resisted change. These explanations aren’t wrong, exactly. But they describe symptoms without identifying the disease.</p>
<p><strong>The real gap isn’t strategy. It’s structure.</strong></p>
<p>Here’s what makes this case diagnostic rather than anecdotal: the Post’s strategies weren’t bad. They were almost identical to the ones that worked at the Times.</p>
<p>A service journalism division? That’s what NYT Cooking, Wirecutter, and Games are. Subscription tiers and bundling? The Times built its entire growth model around that. AI integration? The Times is doing it methodically. Audience diversification beyond hard news? The Times has been executing that playbook for a decade.</p>
<p>Every media CEO in the industry can articulate this strategy. It’s not a secret. The Post wasn’t failing because it lacked vision. It was failing because it couldn’t execute one. And the reason is structural.</p>
<p>I’ve written previously about what I call the Great Decoupling — the way the internet unbundled three things that used to be fused in traditional organizations: formal authority, control over assets, and access to information. In a well-functioning organization, these three sit close together. The people who have decision-making power also control the resources needed to execute and possess the institutional knowledge to deploy them wisely. When the three decouple — when authority lands in one place, assets in another, and information in a third — organizations slow down, and then they eventually stop functioning.</p>
<p>The Post is a textbook case. Not of the Great Decoupling as such — decoupling is a structural reality of the digital era, not a failure mode. What the Post demonstrates is what happens when decisions at the top accelerate the entropy of power instead of managing it.</p>
<p><strong>Formal authority</strong> concentrated in Lewis — the one person who didn’t understand the institution. Three “newsroom” leaders all reported to him. Senior editors told colleagues they’d been “cut out of the process of helping to design the strategy.” Every decision had to be funneled through a bottleneck that lacked context.</p>
<p><strong>Control over assets</strong> — the newsroom, the subscriber base, the editorial talent, the brand — sat with the journalists and editors who were being systematically sidelined. The people who could actually build things had no authority to act. The people with authority had no assets to mobilize, because they didn’t know where they were or how they worked. Arguably, the greatest asset of all eroded completely: trust.</p>
<p><strong>Access to information</strong> — institutional knowledge of the audience, workflows, the organizational history — walked out the door with every departure. The Post has never promoted a CEO from within under Bezos. Every leader arrived with their own people, their own playbook, and no understanding of the institution they were restructuring. David Maraniss, a forty-year Post veteran and Pulitzer winner, captured the dynamic precisely: “The body is rejecting the transfusion.”</p>
<p>I wrote about how authority, assets and information <em>can</em> be stapled back together, temporarily and at a steep cost, through relentless alignment and negotiation. But when authority, assets, and information live in different people who don’t trust each other, execution becomes impossible. You can hire the most talented people in the industry and it won’t matter, if the organization makes it structurally impossible for them to do their jobs.</p>
<p><strong>What the Times actually built</strong></p>
<p>The contrast isn’t just that the Times avoided these mistakes. It’s that the Times built an operating model designed to keep authority, assets, and information integrated — and then held that model through years of iteration.</p>
<p>Meredith Kopit Levien joined the Times in 2013 as head of advertising. She became CRO, then COO, then CEO in 2020 — seven years inside the company before taking the top job. She didn’t need six months to learn what the organization could and couldn’t do. She already knew where the load-bearing walls were, and where the floor creaked. Authority and information, in the same person.</p>
<p>What’s even more remarkable is the structure below her. The Times runs what it calls mission teams — cross-functional groups with legitimate authority to execute against specific objectives. Games, Cooking, Wirecutter, The Athletic: each operates as a defined unit with decision-making power, dedicated resources, and clear boundaries. The Times describes this as a “solar system” model — news is the sun, products are planets, each executing within its orbit without renegotiating authority with every other team.</p>
<p>This is a mission operating model. A stable base — the newsroom, the brand, the data infrastructure — with mission-specific structures that can move fast because they have real authority and real resources. It’s the dual hierarchy I described in my last essay, operating at scale in one of the most complex media organizations in the world.</p>
<p>It took them years to build this. Mark Thompson, Levien’s predecessor and now CEO of CNN, reorganized the Times’ digital operations five times before getting the structure right. Five. Together with Levien. It looks like the Times had the institutional stability to iterate without blowing up the foundation each time. The Post never had that runway because it never stopped churning.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Post tried to copy the strategy. The “third newsroom” for service journalism was identical to what the Times built with Cooking and Wirecutter. But without the operating model underneath — without integrated authority, assets, and information — it was a shell of an org chart. It collapsed in months.</p>
<p><strong>The Bezos paradox</strong></p>
<p>Here is the most interesting thing about this unique moment in media: Jeff Bezos built Amazon — arguably the most structurally disciplined organization in modern business history. Two-Pizza Teams. Single-Threaded Leaders. Clean authority boundaries with decision rights pushed to the edges. Organizational design as a competitive moat. He understood, better than almost anyone alive, that structure determines execution.</p>
<p>And then he bought a newspaper and treated it as a strategy problem.</p>
<p>He threw money at it. Hired a turnaround CEO from outside. Announced bold initiatives. Intervened personally on the endorsement, on the opinion pages, on editorial direction — then went quiet for months. These are the moves of someone who assumes the organizational machinery works and just needs better direction. But the machinery was already fracturing when Lewis arrived, and Lewis fractured it further, and by the time Bezos interfered with editorial, there was no structural coherence left to absorb the shock.</p>
<p>If even Bezos — the architect of Amazon’s operating system — can’t strategy his way past a broken organization, the argument is settled.</p>
<p><strong>The diagnostic question</strong></p>
<p>Hundreds of Post journalists, editors, and staff lost their positions. That fact alone is heavy. But cutting a third of the workforce doesn’t rebuild organizational capacity. It reduces cost. A smaller, cheaper organization that still can’t execute is just a smaller, cheaper version of the same problem.</p>
<p>So the question this essay is really asking isn’t about the Post. It’s about your organization.</p>
<p>Where do formal authority, control over assets, and access to information live? Are they integrated — or have they decoupled? Do the people with decision-making power also have the institutional knowledge and the resources to act? Or are your smartest people spending their days in alignment meetings, negotiating decisions that should take minutes, burning personal capital to bridge gaps in organizational design?</p>
<p>If it’s the latter, your problem is not strategy. You do not need another offsite, another alignment workshop, another visionary leader with a bold plan. You need to stop, look at the wiring, and fix the architecture of the organization.</p>
<p>The news industry just provided the cleanest natural experiment we’re likely to see. Same market, same legacy, same headwinds. The difference was never the strategy.</p>
