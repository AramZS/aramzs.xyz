<p>Scroll through the comments of the official <a href="https://www.instagram.com/screammovies/"><em>Scream</em> franchise Instagram account</a>, and you’ll notice some responses are less than enthusiastic. Amid the expected “can’t wait” and fire emojis responses to the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DQbzX3PEeLx/">first trailer</a> release, for example, you’ll find a smattering of “#boycottscream7” replies. <em>Scream</em> sequels have always had naysayers — fandom anger inspired much of the plot of 2022’s <em>Scream</em> — but the backlash to <em>Scream 7</em> goes beyond the typical casting complaints. It’s a much thornier situation. As one comment by the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/boycottscream7/">@boycottscream7</a> account put it: “22 arts and advocacy organizations from four continents have called for a boycott of this film because it normalizes genocide, apartheid, and blacklisting. Free Palestine. Boycott <em>Scream 7.</em>”</p>
<p>How did the hotly-anticipated sequel in a near-billion-dollar franchise become such a lightning rod for controversy? Here’s how the <em>Scream 7</em> boycott began, who’s behind it, and what it means for the movie.</p>
<h2 data-editable="text" data-uri="www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cmm41s3gh000u3b7c5vlx5nap@published">    Where did the <em>Scream 7</em> backlash start?  </h2>
<p>Following the critical and box-office success of 2023’s <em>Scream VI</em>, excitement for the follow-up film was high. But the sequel hit a serious roadblock in November 2023, when franchise star Melissa Barrera — who had starred in the <em>Scream</em> requel and <em>Scream VI</em> as Billy Loomis’ secret daughter Sam Carpenter — was abruptly <a href="https://variety.com/2023/film/news/hollywood-divide-over-israel-melissa-barrera-1235804452/">fired for social media posts</a> critical of Israel in the wake of the October 7 attacks and Israel’s subsequent war in Gaza. One post in particular was alleged to be antisemitic by Spyglass Media Group: “Western media only shows the [Israeli] side. Why do they do that, I will let you deduce for yourself.”</p>
<p>“Spyglass’ stance is unequivocally clear,” the company said in a <a href="https://variety.com/2023/film/news/scream-producers-explain-melissa-barrera-fired-antisemitism-1235804914/">statement to Variety</a>. “We have zero tolerance for antisemitism or the incitement of hate in any form, including false references to genocide, ethnic cleansing, Holocaust distortion or anything that flagrantly crosses the line into hate speech.”</p>
<p>Barrera issued a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/nov/23/melissa-barrera-fired-from-scream-vii-over-israel-hamas-posts-responds-silence-is-not-an-option">statement of her own</a> on Instagram. “First and foremost I condemn antisemitism and Islamophobia. I condemn hate and prejudice of any kind against any group of people,” she wrote. She went on to say, “I pray day and night for no more deaths, for no more violence, and for peaceful co-existence. I will continue to speak out for those that need it most and continue to advocate for peace and safety, for human rights and freedom. Silence is not an option for me.”</p>
<h2 data-editable="text" data-uri="www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cmm41s3ie000w3b7cyuxcqldq@published">    What was the fallout from Barrera’s firing?  </h2>
<p><em>Scream 7</em> originally had Barrera at its center, so her dismissal threw plans for the sequel into immediate disarray. She wasn’t the only casualty of Spyglass’ decision: Shortly after Barrera’s firing, it was announced that Jenna Ortega — who starred as Sam’s sister, Tara, in the preceding two films — would not be returning for <em>Scream 7</em> either. At the time, the decision was attributed to Ortega’s <a href="https://deadline.com/2023/11/jenna-ortega-scream-departure-melissa-barrera-wednesday-1235634200/"><em>Wednesday</em> filming schedule</a>. The actor later refuted this in a May 2025 <a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/jenna-ortega-wednesday-season-2-death-of-a-unicorn-interview.html">interview with The Cut</a>, noting that she walked away after Barrera’s firing, and following the earlier departures of <em>Scream VI</em> directors Tyler Gillett and Matt Bettinelli-Olpin. “The Melissa stuff was happening, and it was all kind of falling apart,” Ortega said. “If [<em>Scream 7</em>] wasn’t going to be with that team of directors and those people I fell in love with, then it didn’t seem like the right move for me in my career at the time.”</p>
<p>Christopher Landon, who had taken over as director on the film, also left the project. “I made my decision to walk away about a week after they fired [Barrera],” he shared in an interview for Ashley Cullins’ August 2025 book <em>Your Favorite Scary Movie: How the Scream Films Rewrote the Rules of Horror</em>. “There was no movie anymore. The whole script was about her. I didn’t sign on to make ‘a <em>Scream</em> movie.’ I signed on to make <em>that</em> movie. When that movie no longer existed, I moved on.” Landon reported <a href="https://ew.com/christopher-landon-scream-7-death-threats-melissa-barrera-exit-too-intense-11792476">receiving credible death threats</a> amid the online anger surrounding Barrera’s firing, which prompted his choice to publicly announce his own departure.</p>
<h2 data-editable="text" data-uri="www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cmm41s3k3000x3b7cvt0v2aue@published">    When did calls for a boycott start?  </h2>
<p>The backlash to Spyglass’ decision to boot Barrera from the franchise was swift, with free speech advocates and pro-Palestine activists condemning the studio. In December 2023, the @boycottscream7 Instagram account, a grassroots effort among <em>Scream</em> fans, posted several slides explaining the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C00hr9bNhFV/">rationale behind a boycott</a>. “Spyglass Media Group fired Melissa Barrera from her role in the <em>Scream</em> franchise for making statements in opposition to the ongoing Israeli bombardment of Gaza,” the first post reads. “Spyglass falsely and maliciously accused Barrera of antisemitism. This was a racist firing that attempted to normalize Israeli state violence against Palestinians and stifle peaceful protest through blacklisting.”</p>
<p>Throughout the production of <em>Scream 7</em> — including the announcement that original <em>Scream</em> writer Kevin Williamson had returned to direct, and that star Neve Campbell would be reprising her role of Sidney Prescott — rumblings about a boycott were persistent but largely on the fringes. The debut of the first trailer in October 2025 inspired more <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/10/scream-7-trailer-backlash-boycott-melissa-barrera-firing-1236603348/">mainstream coverage of the backlash</a>.</p>
<h2 data-editable="text" data-uri="www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cmm41s3ln000y3b7ch6y2y36v@published">    Who is supporting the boycott?  </h2>
<p>According to a <a href="https://boycottscream7pressrelease.tiiny.site/">press release</a>, more than 20 organizations have joined the call to boycott <em>Scream 7</em>, including the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions Movement (BDS)/Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel (PACBI), Film Workers for Palestine, Code Pink, and Jewish Voice for Peace — Los Angeles. And, of course, there are the many <em>Scream</em> fans who have voiced their support for the movement — in social media replies and beyond — and who have announced their own plans to skip <em>Scream 7</em>.</p>
<h2 data-editable="text" data-uri="www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cmm41s3nf00103b7capva14w7@published">    What has Melissa Barrera said about the boycott?  </h2>
<p>In a November 2024 <a href="https://www.the-independent.com/arts-entertainment/films/features/melissa-barrera-palestine-your-monster-interview-b2653157.html">interview with<em> The Independent</em></a> pegged to the release of the film <em>Your Monster</em>, Barrera acknowledged that she struggled in the aftermath of her firing from the <em>Scream</em> franchise. “It was the darkest and hardest year of my life, and I had to reevaluate everything,” she said. “There were times where I felt like my life was over.”</p>
<p>When asked specifically about the divide between fans excited to watch a new <em>Scream</em> installment starring Neve Campbell and those opting out, Barrera told <em>The Independent</em>, “There are always going to be people that love you and people that hate you, and people that are open to a story continuing, and people that think that continuing it is ruining it. If they want to go watch the next one? Cool. If they don’t? Also cool.”</p>
<p>She added, “You just gotta act according to how you preach. And that depends on what you value, what your morals are, and whether you can separate that from art or not.” In other words, the choice is in your hands.</p>
<h2 data-editable="text" data-uri="www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cmm41s3ov00123b7c4j2y9z45@published">    What have the <em>Scream 7</em> cast and creative team said about Barrera’s firing or the boycott?  </h2>
<p>Not a whole lot, which perhaps shouldn’t come as much of a surprise given the price Barrera paid for speaking out. The closest any of the <em>Scream 7</em> cast has come to a public statement is what Jasmin Savoy Brown, who plays Mindy Meeks-Martin, shared with Ashley Cullin for <em>Your Favorite Scary Movie</em>. “It’s been really sad and stressful,” Brown told the author when reflecting on the year since Barrera’s firing. “Often actors are expected to know as much about politics as politicians. And, in today’s day and age when everything is online, everyone thinks they’re an expert in everything, which isn’t the case. I also think there is a clear difference between talking politics and standing up for people who don’t have a voice. It’s not politics, it’s human life.”</p>
<p>Without naming names, Cullin also writes that the people from the <em>Scream</em> franchise she spoke with were generally aligned on the fact that Barrera’s “heart was in the right place,” and that Spyglass should not have fired her so quickly without an attempt at a conversation.</p>
<p>Oddly enough, one of the few <em>Scream</em> series stars to come to Barrera’s defense publicly was Jamie Kennedy, who played Randy Meeks in the original trilogy. Kennedy, however, spoke not from a pro-Palestine perspective, but from an anti-cancel culture one. “[Barrera] should have never been fired,” he <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/jamie-kennedy-defends-anti-israel-actress-from-cancelation-starring-pro-life-film-radicalized-him">told Fox News</a> in a May 2025 interview. “She has her beliefs, OK? She’s allowed to have her beliefs. Other people on set have other beliefs. This is, you know, it’s the most difficult subject — one of the most difficult subjects to discuss right now in modern times. And she’s brave enough to put her beliefs out there. If you don’t like them, call her up. Talk to her.”</p>
<p>At <em>Scream 7</em>’s February 25 premiere, Kevin Williamson was asked to address the boycott and the <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/scream-7-protestors-free-palestine.html">pro-Palestine protesters</a> gathered outside the event. On the red carpet, the director <a href="https://x.com/Variety/status/2026861607091920953">told Variety</a>, “We live in a world where a lot of bad things are happening out there, and I think a lot of people want to be heard and they want to have their voice heard about the bad stuff that’s happening. My heart goes out to them. I don’t know if canceling Paramount+ is the way to do it. But I think people should listen to their inner self and do what feels good for them.”</p>
<h2 data-editable="text" data-uri="www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cmm41s3sj00153b7cwo57yx3c@published">    Are there other reasons to boycott <em>Scream 7</em>?  </h2>
<p>The Barrera firing is the big one, to be clear, but that’s not the only reason the film has earned its share of detractors ahead of its release. In a bigger-picture sense, Paramount, which merged with Skydance in August 2025, has not been shy about its opinions on anti-Israel sentiment. In September of last year, the company <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/paramount-condemns-israeli-film-boycott-1236516511/">condemned an Israeli film boycott pledge</a> signed by 3,900 industry figures — including, notably, Melissa Barrera. This isn’t surprising to those familiar with the Ellison family. Paramount head David Ellison is the son of billionaire Larry Ellison, a strong supporter of Israel and personal friend of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Larry Ellison’s takeover of TikTok has led to claims by users that the app is <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2026/1/29/whats-upscrolled-the-app-gaining-popularity-after-tiktoks-us-takeover">suppressing pro-Palestine content</a>.</p>
<p>Ellison family politics aside, <em>Scream 7</em> has also received pushback for less serious but still controversy-stirring reasons. As part of the lead-up to the film’s release, the movie <a href="https://theplaylist.net/incredibly-bleak-horror-fans-roast-dystopic-scream-7-promo-for-turning-death-into-a-prediction-bet-20260206/">partnered with prediction-market platform Kalshi</a> to produce “survival odds” for <em>Scream 7</em>’s cast of characters, a grim reminder of the omnipresence of online gambling. A separate <a href="https://www.facebook.com/metaai/posts/do-you-like-scary-movies-get-the-scream-7-vibe-open-the-meta-ai-app-prompt-creat/122317826444220997/">partnership with Meta AI</a> prompted predictable rebukes. “Just incredibly bleak shit happening with this movie from the jump and it’s somehow getting worse everyday,” one <a href="https://x.com/jaimeblack/status/2019633940143718482">X user posted</a>. “Zionism and AI and now gambling. How are all involved not embarrassed?”</p>
<h2 data-editable="text" data-uri="www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cmm41s3u200183b7cic0envix@published">    Is the boycott going to actually affect <em>Scream 7</em>’s box office?  </h2>
<p>That depends on who you ask. “A boycott of Scream 7 from pro-Palestinian activists appears to have failed as the horror sequel eyes a potentially record-breaking box office debut,” <em>The Daily Mail</em> <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-15536117/Scream-boycott-pro-Palestine-activists-fails-horror-sequel-heads-huge-box-office-opening.html">loudly proclaimed</a> in a recent article. And sure, <em>Scream 7</em> tracking to open in the mid $30 million to <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/02/scream-7-box-office-opening-1236734856/">$40 million</a> range is impressive — but that’s still less than the <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/02/scream-7-box-office-projection-1236710167/">record-breaking $44.4 million opening</a> of the Melissa Barrera-starring <em>Scream VI</em>. Is the drop-off because of the absence of star Jenna Ortega, or because pro-Palestine <em>Scream</em> fans plan to sit this one out? Inevitably, <em>Scream 7</em>’s box office will be read as both a boycott failure and a boycott success, with advocates on both sides telling the story that best suits their narrative.</p>
<p>Look at a film like 2025’s <em>Snow White</em>, a disaster for Disney that <a href="https://nypost.com/2026/02/15/business/disney-loses-170-million-with-snow-white-live-action-flop/">cost the studio $170 million</a>. Zionists placed much of the blame on star Rachel Zegler, who criticized Israel, Donald Trump, and Trump supporters. The @boycottscream7 press release, on the other hand, points to BDS’ boycott of <em>Snow White</em> over the involvement of Gal Gadot, “an active propagandist for the Israeli military,” as a culprit for the film flopping. This is not to endorse or refute either claim, but to note that when the dust has settled on <em>Scream 7</em>, supporters and detractors of the boycott are likely to make definitive statements that will be hard to prove. What’s less debatable in the meantime is the fact that Barrera’s firing has had widespread effects on <em>Scream 7</em> and the future of the <em>Scream</em> franchise. For many fans, it’s a taint that won’t be easily washed away.</p>
