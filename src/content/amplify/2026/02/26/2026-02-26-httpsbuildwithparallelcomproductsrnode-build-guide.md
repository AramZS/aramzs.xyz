<p><strong>This is a digital field manual. No hardware included.</strong> This guide walks you step-by-step through building your first working RNode — clearly, practically, and without guesswork — then levels you up into more advanced builds like Wi-Fi HaLow cards, mixed-radio hybrid networks, Layer-2 BATMAN-adv advanced mesh routing, and full OpenMANET deployments.</p>
<p>Core build cost typically ranges from <strong>$60–$150 per node</strong>, depending on board selection, LoRa module choice, antenna configuration, and enclosure.</p>
<p>No subscriptions. No cloud dependencies. No vendor lock-in.</p>
<h2>Reticulum Infrastructure Without the Guesswork</h2>
<p>There are forum posts. There are GitHub threads. There are partial builds that almost work.</p>
<p>This guide gives you a working RNode — start to finish.</p>
<p>You’ll deploy a cryptographically secure Reticulum LoRa node you fully control. Not theory. Not lab talk. A real node with verified firmware, clean boot, startup LED confirmation, and live data activity.</p>
<p>The configuration documented here fixes issues that caused early community builds to fail. You get the exact firmware and corrected wiring that worked in my deployment — including pixel confirmation on startup and activity indication during data transfer.</p>
<h2>What You’ll Learn in the Field Manual</h2>
<ul> <li>How to build a fully functional Reticulum RNode using off-the-shelf hardware</li> <li>The exact firmware used in my tested build</li> <li>Corrected wiring diagrams that actually boot and operate reliably</li> <li>Step-by-step flashing and provisioning workflow</li> <li>Reticulum identity generation, configuration, and validation</li> <li>How to test your node and confirm real packet flow</li> <li>RF fundamentals for LoRa deployment (antenna, placement, tuning basics)</li> <li>Common failure points and precise fixes</li> <li>Expansion paths beyond a single node</li> </ul>
<h2>Automation &amp; Deployment Scripts Included</h2>
<p>You don’t just get commands. You get repeatable workflows.</p>
<ul> <li>Prebuilt setup scripts to accelerate configuration</li> <li>Clean install procedures for fresh builds</li> <li>Upgrade guidance for future firmware iterations</li> <li>Structured validation steps so you know your node is actually working</li> </ul>
<p>This dramatically reduces trial-and-error and makes deploying multiple nodes realistic.</p>
<h2>Integrates with OpenMANET &amp; Haven</h2>
<p>This isn’t an isolated science project.</p>
<ul> <li>Bridge your RNode into an OpenMANET deployment</li> <li>Layer Reticulum over your Haven nodes</li> <li>Combine IP mesh (802.11s / BATMAN-adv) with sub-GHz LoRa resilience</li> <li>Create a hybrid architecture: high-bandwidth MANET + long-range overlay</li> </ul>
<p>If Haven is your backbone, RNode becomes your resilient fallback layer.</p>
<h2>No Subscriptions. No Cloud. No Gatekeepers.</h2>
<p>This guide is built for operators who want to understand and own their infrastructure.</p>
<p>You get lifetime access to the manual and future updates as the RNode ecosystem evolves.</p>
<h2>Who It’s For</h2>
<ul> <li>Haven operators adding a LoRa resilience layer</li> <li>OpenMANET builders expanding into sub-GHz overlays</li> <li>Privacy-first technologists who prefer open protocols</li> <li>Entrepreneurs exploring decentralized infrastructure</li> </ul>
<h2>This Guide Is NOT For You If:</h2>
<ul> <li>You want a prebuilt plug-and-play device</li> <li>You expect one-click beginner simplicity</li> <li>You’re unwilling to troubleshoot and learn how the system works</li> </ul>
<h2>Instant Access. No DRM. Yours to Keep.</h2>
<p>This is a digital product delivered immediately after purchase. No subscription. No lock-in. Just a proven framework for deploying your own Reticulum RNode whenever and wherever you need it.</p>
<p><strong>Buy once. Deploy anywhere. Control everything.</strong></p>
