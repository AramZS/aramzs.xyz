<p>The PS1 was an unrivaled time for soundtracks that go incredibly hard. Games like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurhMeaUThM&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Ridge Racer Type 4</u></em></a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/CuOd_mTABn8?si=plEy7cxdS7K60IZX&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>No One Can Stop Mr. Domino</u></em></a>, <em>Ape Escape</em> (and basically anything that Soichi Terada ever did), <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S5ZpFWA16g&amp;list=PLDD61C76EF278E530&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Ace Combat 3 Electrosphere</u></em></a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9avhp8QuAlk&amp;list=PLF8A81FAC049FB959&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Ghost in the Shell: Megatech Body</u></em></a> all punch well above their weight. Hell, even the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/seanseanson.bsky.social/post/3me56ggnr222z?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Animorphs</u></a> game kinda goes. In that vein, if you have never listened to the soundtrack to <em>Sheep, Dog 'n' Wolf </em>AKA<em> Looney Tunes Sheep Raider</em>, you should correct that right now because it contains at least one incredible heater.</p>

<p><em>Sheep, Dog ‘n' Wolf </em>was a bizarre celshaded stealth action puzzler that came out in 2001 starring Ralph Wolf (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Wolf_and_Sam_Sheepdog?ref=aftermath.site"><u>NOT Wile E. Coyote</u></a>) and described at the time by Infogrames’ Director of Marketing as “E-Rated Metal Gear.” The soundtrack was done by a musician named Eric Caspar, and though a lot of it feels like boilerplate production music, it does have bangers.</p>
<figure><img alt="SHEEP RAIDER  THE BOTTOM LINE 7.25  Concept Ralph Wolf must try to steal  Sam the Sheep Dog's Flock. Gameplay: Similar to Lemmings. but only sheep he age-old debate rages on. Do graphics really a roncent: Sound: All the classic Loony Tunes effects you'd expect Entertainment: It may Not look like much, but it's is fun, and continually tests your skills and Wit  Replay Value: Moderate  The age old debate rages on. Do graphics really matter? The engine this games runs on is similar to that of a first-genreation PlayStatio title. The texturing brings back memories of the Atari Jaguar, and the camera system requires constant user interaction. To say Sheep Raider looks nice is similar to saying Joan Rivers is a beautiful ceature.  If you can overlook this aspect. which is difficult since you're staring at it the entire time, I'm sure you'll find the gameplay  to be quite interesting and thoroughly entertaining. The tactics used for stealing Sam's sheep unfolds much like the gameplay in Lemmings.  Using a handful of stealth maneuvers, you'll need to sneak up on a sheep and grab it when Sam isn't looking. After this, you'll need to lead the sheep to an exit. To accomplish this, however, you'll need to solve a number of uniquely styled puzzles that throw your conventional thinking through loops.  Hysterical and obscure, Sheep Raider should be a welcome addition to any puzzle fanatic's library.  @ STYLE 1 PLAYER ACTION @ PUBLISHER INFOGRAMES LYON HOUSE 8 DEVELOPER BLACK Moderate SHEEP @ RELEASE SEPTEMBER 26" data-action="zoom" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px" src="https://aftermath.site/content/images/2026/02/data-src-image-419511e0-1fd9-4a33-8582-46732f6cde2a.png" srcset="https://aftermath.site/content/images/size/w600/2026/02/data-src-image-419511e0-1fd9-4a33-8582-46732f6cde2a.png 600w, https://aftermath.site/content/images/size/w1000/2026/02/data-src-image-419511e0-1fd9-4a33-8582-46732f6cde2a.png 1000w, https://aftermath.site/content/images/2026/02/data-src-image-419511e0-1fd9-4a33-8582-46732f6cde2a.png 1450w"/><figcaption>Game Informer gave it a 7.25!

<p>One track in particular stands out, an ambient DnB track that could easily fit into any racing game from the era. It is unclear what this track is called or if it has a name, although I have seen a few sites like KHInsider and Discogs cite it as “<a href="https://downloads.khinsider.com/game-soundtracks/album/sheep-dog-n-wolf-original-soundtrack?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Fronzy Last</u></a>/Fronzylast_v3.” The track itself appears in the Planet X stage later in the game, which you can see by watching this speedrun attempt.</p>

<p>Anyway, enjoy this oddly specific track that keeps appearing in my YouTube suggested feed. Also check out this extremely of-the-era full page print ad complete with Typewriter font.</p>
