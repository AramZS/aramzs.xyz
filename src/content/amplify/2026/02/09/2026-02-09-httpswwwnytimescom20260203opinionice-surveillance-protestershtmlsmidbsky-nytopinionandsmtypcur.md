<p>In the latest stop in Donald Trump’s war on liberal democracy, federal agents in Minnesota have shot and killed Renee Good and Alex Pretti. It was difficult to avoid the videos of what I can only think of as their executions. The images captured by bystanders and immigrant agents were reminiscent of the lynching postcards that white spectators once bought and traded — reproductions of retributive violence, tailor-made to titillate and intimidate.</p>
<p>Alex Pretti’s killing, in particular, struck a chord of dismay with a cross section of Americans. There is some small measure of comfort that our public conscience can still be shocked. One may wish that it had happened sooner — when other people died in ICE custody this past year or immigrants were rounded up into camps. But whichever abuse convinced you, whichever needless death shocked you, you are here now. You need to pay attention to the guns ICE agents are pointing at all of us. You also need to pay attention to everything happening around the guns.</p>
<p>Just before Jonathan Ross, an ICE agent, pulled the gun that he discharged into Good’s minivan, he was shooting video of the incident on his cellphone.</p>
<p>The gun <em>and</em> the phone are both weapons, one a tool for violence and the other a tool of control.</p>
<p>We understand what the gun is intended to do. That’s why, finally, opposition to the Trump administration seems to be coalescing around a rallying cry: “Abolish ICE!” It’s another way of saying, control the hand that holds the gun. It is the gun that produces the spectacle of violence from which we cannot, in good conscience, look away. Yes, we must pay attention to the gun.</p>
<p>But, we must also pay attention to the phone.</p>
<p>That phone represents a greater power, one that could outlast Trumpism. ICE knows that it cannot shoot us all. But the Department of Homeland Security is close to being able to track us all.</p>
<p>Trump’s signature domestic policy bill gave ICE $75 billion in new funding and four years to spend it, making ICE the highest funded federal law enforcement agency. The agency is spending big on signing <a href="https://www.themarshallproject.org/2025/10/18/florida-ice-job-police-hiring">bonuses</a> — 12,000 new officers and agents have been <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/news/2026/01/03/ice-announces-historic-120-manpower-increase-thanks-recruitment-campaign-brought">hired</a> with One Big Beautiful Bill money — <a href="https://www.themarshallproject.org/2025/10/18/florida-ice-job-police-hiring">and</a> cutting-edge military <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/10/ice-spending-small-arms-weapons-chemical-munitions-increased-700-percent-2025/">weaponry</a> to use on American streets. The Department of Homeland Security also has been, <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2026/01/ice-going-surveillance-shopping-spree">reportedly</a>, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/26/ice-high-tech-surveillance-lower-privacy-guardrails-00705401">spending some of its budget</a> to collect data on <a href="https://americandragnet.org/">people like you</a>.</p>
