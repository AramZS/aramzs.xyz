title: Lawmakers say some Epstein files remain redacted despite DOJ’s pledge
---
<p>Some of the Epstein documents that the Justice Department <a href="https://www.ms.now/news/doj-says-congress-can-see-unredacted-epstein-files-next-week">invited members of Congress to view</a> at a reading room at their D.C. headquarters have remained redacted, despite officials’ promises otherwise, according to two lawmakers who visited the room Monday.</p>
<p>Reps. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., and Jared Moskowitz, D-Fla., told reporters they wanted answers from the Justice Department about why some materials retained redactions.</p>
<p>“What I saw today was that there were lots of examples of people’s names being redacted when they were not victims,” said Raskin, who was among the first lawmakers to visit the reading room on Monday.</p>
<p>Raskin said some redactions appeared “suspicious and baffling,” including one related to billionaire businessman Les Wexner, who has been <a href="https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00245832.pdf">photographed with Epstein</a> and <a href="https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00256987.pdf">on a plane</a>. Wexner has denied any involvement of Epstein’s crimes and is due to testify before Congress on Feb. 18.</p>
<p>Raskin said those redactions “struck me as strange, because [Wexner’s] not a victim, and also his name has appeared elsewhere.” He said he didn’t know whether to chalk it up to “sloppiness and negligence” or something else.</p>
<p>President Donald Trump’s name was also redacted “in a number of different places,” Raskin said. He said he read a conversation between lawyers for convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and Trump discussing the 2009 plea deal, brokered by then-U.S. Attorney Alex Acosta, that led Epstein to plead guilty to a single state count of solicitation of prostitution and to register as a sex offender. Trump has denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein.</p>
<p>Moskowitz said he viewed “grand jury testimony that’s redacted,” adding “There are names in legal documents that are still redacted.”</p>
<p>The most recent <a href="https://www.ms.now/news/justice-department-releases-3-million-more-jeffrey-epstein-files">batch of files comprises</a> more than three million pages, including 2,000 videos and 18,000 images. It was released at the end of January, despite the Epstein Files Transparency Act requiring the release of all files by Dec. 19. In addition to Trump, the newly released files contain references to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Elon Musk and other famous and prominent people. But so far there is no evidence of any criminal wrongdoing by any of the principals mentioned.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/media/1426091/dl">DOJ has said</a> that it redacted or withheld about 200,000 pages “based on various privileges.” A formal report from the DOJ to the House and Senate Judiciary Committees explaining those redactions is due within the week.</p>
<p>Spokespeople for the DOJ and the White House did not immediately respond to questions from MS NOW on Monday afternoon.</p>
<p>While some names have remained hidden, others have been left out in the open. MS NOW’s review of the files found that dozens of known or suspected survivors’ names were unredacted, <a href="https://www.ms.now/news/sloppy-redactions-in-epstein-documents-are-traumatizing-survivors">prompting blowback from survivors</a> and their allies.</p>
<p>“Obviously, we’re most concerned about the failure to redact when it comes to the victims,” Raskin said Monday. He said that in reviewing the files he saw a reference to a girl as young as 9 years old, calling it “gruesome and grim.”</p>
<p>Moskowitz, too, described some of the material he saw as “disgusting” and “gross.”</p>
<p>The lawmakers’ viewing of the unredacted files comes after <a href="https://www.ms.now/news/doj-says-congress-can-see-unredacted-epstein-files-next-week">the DOJ announced</a> Friday that members of Congress could review the full, publicly released files on computers in a reading room at its D.C. headquarters beginning Monday. Doing so would require giving the department 24 hours’ notice and leaving electronics, and staff members, behind, according to a letter Assistant Attorney General Patrick Davis sent to members.</p>
<p>After leaving the room Monday, Raskin told reporters it had four computers and that he began his search by looking for keywords related to specific documents that had “puzzling redactions.” He said that according to calculations by his staffers, it would take seven years to get through the files in the current conditions established by the DOJ. It could take 2 months if there were 217 computers to represent nearly everyone who <a href="https://clerk.house.gov/DischargePetition/2025090209">signed the discharge petition</a> to force a vote on the Epstein Files Transparency Act.</p>
<p>“We’re talking about a huge, staggering amount of information,” he said. Raskin’s office did not immediately respond to an inquiry from MS NOW about how the staff came up with those figures.</p>
<p>The DOJ’s move to allow lawmakers to view the unredacted files followed <a href="https://democrats-judiciary.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/democrats-judiciary.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/2026-01-31-raskin-to-blanche-doj-re-epstein-files.pdf">mounting pressure from members of Congress</a> seeking to review the full files ahead of Attorney General Pam Bondi’s testimony before the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday.</p>
<p>As of midafternoon Monday, MS NOW had seen only a handful of lawmakers visit the room. In addition to Moskowitz and Raskin, Rep. Suhas Subramanyam, D-Va., and Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Ro Khanna, D-Calif., the co-sponsors of the Epstein Files Transparency Act, also entered the reading room. Massie and Khanna plan to address reporters late afternoon Monday after visiting the room to view the files. On Sunday, Massie <a href="https://x.com/RepThomasMassie/status/2020620474888474941?s=20">crowdsourced recommendations on X</a> of which files to review.</p>
