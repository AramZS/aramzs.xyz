<p>A trickster whether in sensual or realist mode, Luca Guadagnino (<em>Call Me By Your Name, Challengers, Queer</em>) might have looked like the right director to toy with American conceptions of so-called political correctness at elite universities. He must have instructed a squandered Julia Roberts into reciting her lines like they’re written on a PowerPoint several miles away. <em>The Bear</em>‘s Ayo Edebiri, the student who hurls the <em>j’accuse</em> at Professor Andrew Garfield (we know he’s a professor because of his jacket’s elbow pads), comes across as a nepo baby fraud. Everyone’s a fraud. If all are guilty, Hannah Arendt warned, then none are.</p>

<p>A former star laments why his own travails are so tedious that the filmmaker wrote a part big enough for Adam Sandler to steal the movie.</p>

<p>Yorgos Lanthimos’ latest Emma Stone collaboration drapes his symphonic pomposity and distancing devices around a high concept: a conspiracy theorist Teddy Gatz (Jesse Plemons) and his autistic cousin Don (Aidan Delbis), convinced that “Andromedans” are not only responsible for most diseases but the death of bees, kidnap Michelle (Stone), the CEO of a pharmaceutical company, after suspecting she’s one of them. Like Guadagnino his statement about The Way We Live Now devolves into chickenshit reversals. Perhaps chickenshit reversals are part of The Way We Live Now.</p>
