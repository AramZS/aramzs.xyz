  ‘I’m dead.’ As Haitian temporary protected status ends Tuesday, it’s unknown
  how some people will survive.
---
<p>For tens of thousands of Haitians in Massachusetts, this week brings a multitude of concerns and questions, the answers to which could be life-altering.</p>
<p>How will they find legal work? Could they gain asylum status? Will they be sent back to Haiti, a country torn apart by gang violence? What will become of their children, some of whom are American citizens?</p>
<p>They have lived here under Temporary Protected Status, or TPS, <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2026/01/20/metro/haiti-tps/?p1=StaffPage&amp;p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link">a legal protection that shields immigrants from deportation and grants them work permits</a>. It is reserved for those fleeing countries in the midst of upheaval.</p>

<p>But such protection will cease for Haitians on Tuesday, per an order by the Trump administration. In Massachusetts, an estimated 45,000 Haitian TPS holders are being thrown into limbo, stripped of their ability to work, and paralyzed by a fear they will be sent back to a country in violent chaos that some of them have not visited for decades.</p>
<p>“I’m not free,” said one Haitian named Bruno, who asked to be identified by only his first name as he fears being targeted by immigration authorities. “I don’t have a legal status.”</p>

<p>TPS for Haitians was first granted in 2010, after an earthquake shattered the country, and it has remained in the years since as gang violence has taken over large parts of the nation.</p>
<p>The Trump administration has said the status is no longer of national interest.</p>
<p><a href="https://apnews.com/article/immigration-trump-venezuela-haiti-court-9049b2f6a934b80bead487639c1cf9af">A federal judge in Washington is expected to rule any day on a request to immediately pause the termination</a> of TPS for Haiti, while a separate lawsuit challenging the administration’s actions proceeds, according to the Associated Press.</p>
<p>The uncertainty has left some Haitians in Boston, which has one of the largest concentrations of people from Haiti in the country, worried for themselves or members of their community.</p>
<p>Bruno, 60, has called the United States home for almost 17 years, having fled Port-au-Prince, where he ran a grocery store, after the earthquake “wiped out” everything he had. Speaking in Haitian Creole through an interpreter during a phone interview with the Globe, Bruno said he is grateful for the opportunities the US has afforded him and his family.</p>
<p>“I love this country,” he said.</p>

<p>Until recently, he drove a bus for the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, but his boss told him that without legal status, he would not be able to work. He has a mortgage on a home in Brockton and three sons, one of whom is studying engineering at UMass Dartmouth, while the youngest is still in high school. Bruno applied for asylum but was denied.</p>
<p>“I feel extremely devastated,” he said.</p>
<p>Another local Haitian with temporary status who worked as an MBTA bus driver had similar concerns. She spoke on the condition of anonymity as she is afraid she will be targeted by immigration authorities.</p>
<p>“It’s like I’m dead, I’m dead,” she said in between sobs during a phone interview in English. “Because I have no one.”</p>
<p>The woman, a 57-year-old who owns a home in Stoughton, said her 20-year-old son, a security guard who wishes to become an electrician, is an American citizen and has never been to Haiti.</p>
<p>She raised him as a single mother after his father died from illness when he was 4. She fled Haiti 24 years ago because of the violence she was subjected to, which continues today; her nephew was abducted and murdered by gangs last week.  Gangs in the nation’s capital of Port-au-Prince had burned down her home.</p>
<p>“Right now, I’m in so much pain,” she said.</p>
<p>One woman, a 32-year-old Mattapan resident who was nearly shot while living in Haiti, has a 2-year-old daughter here who is an American citizen. She works as a certified nursing assistant for mentally disabled youth, but she’s not sure how she will pay bills after Tuesday.</p>
<p>She has not considered applying for asylum because she is afraid of being detained at the courthouse, should the hearing not go her way.</p>
<p>Some advocates describe the mood in Greater Boston’s Haitian diaspora, the third-largest in the country, as a collective panic attack.</p>
<p>“To a large degree, the Haitian community feels under assault,” said Sarang Sekhavat, chief of staff for the Massachusetts Immigrant &amp; Refugee Advocacy Coalition.</p>
<p>Temporary status holders, Sekhavat said, “are people who have done everything the right way,” which means the government has their information, including home addresses. It remains to be seen if there will be surges of immigration enforcement similar to those in Minnesota or Maine, or if TPS holders will be sent notices to appear in immigration court.</p>
<p>Denise Williams, a domestic violence prevention advocate at the Association of Haitian Women in Boston, said she has heard some Haitians talk about self-deporting in light of the temporary status expiration. For them, the promised land of the United States has come up short.</p>
<p>“It’s problem, after problem, after problem,” she said. “The anxiety is too much.”</p>
<p>Boston City Councilor Ruthzee Louijeune, a Haitian American, called the Trump administration’s decision to revoke temporary status reckless, adding that the move was rooted in xenophobia and racism.</p>
<p>“It’s bigoted, it’s terrible,” she said.</p>
<p>Trump made a surge of migrants at the southern border a central issue in his winning 2024 presidential campaign, and his administration has instituted an immigration crackdown since he took office in the White House in January 2025.</p>
<p>Louijeune said the end of temporary status for thousands of Haitians who have been living and working here “is going to have severe consequences for families, for our economy.”</p>
<p>Indeed, local leaders have warned that the expiration could harm multiple sectors, including health care, transportation, and restaurants.</p>
<p>“They are not liabilities,” said Dieufort Fleurissaint, a local community leader known as Pastor Keke, of Haitian TPS holders. “They are assets.”</p>
<p>The labor union 32BJ SEIU estimates that 150 Haitians have lost their jobs at Logan International Airport during the past year because of the looming status expiration.</p>
<p>And at a recent health care summit, Governor Maura Healey acknowledged the harmful consequences the decision could bring. She said she was waiting on a federal court ruling on a legal challenge to the expiration.</p>
<p>“We know that there are many Haitians employed in the health industry, doing important work, playing an essential role,” she said.</p>
<p>On Friday, Healey implored Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to extend temporary status for Haitians, saying, “The sudden loss of their legal status and work authorization would be devastating for our state.”</p>
<p>Jennifer Bade, a Brookline immigration attorney who has multiple Haitian TPS-holding clients, considers the decision to end the status cruel, as many may not qualify for asylum.</p>
<p>To be eligible for asylum, an applicant must be unable or unwilling to return to their country because they fear persecution on the grounds of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.</p>
<p>If people are simply fearful of gang violence or general civil unrest, Bade said, “that’s what TPS is for.”</p>
<p>“This leaves a lot of people in turmoil,” she said.</p>
