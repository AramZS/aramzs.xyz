<p>By revealing, on January 16, in a filmed interview with The News – a pro-Israel news site posting on X – that she was the subject of an arrest warrant issued by French judges, French-Israeli lawyer Nili Kupfer-Naouri confirmed developments in a judicial investigation opened in spring 2025 for complicity in genocide and incitement to genocide in Gaza. The investigation targets civilians who blocked the delivery of humanitarian aid to the Palestinian enclave during the war led by Israel between 2023 and 2025, following the October 7 terrorist attacks by Hamas.</p>
<p><em>Le Monde</em> has learned, with confirmation from the plaintiffs and their lawyers, that two arrest warrants were issued in summer 2025 against two French-Israeli activists: Nili Kupfer-Naouri, founder and president of the charity Israel Is Forever, which states its mission as the "mobilization of French-speaking Zionist forces," and Rachel T., spokesperson for the collective Tsav 9, which repeatedly blocked trucks headed for Gaza in 2024. Israel Is Forever called for supporters to join these actions and mobilized volunteers.</p>
