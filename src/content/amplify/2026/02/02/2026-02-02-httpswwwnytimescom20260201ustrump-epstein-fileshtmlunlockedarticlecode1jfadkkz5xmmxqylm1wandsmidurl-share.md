<p>The Justice Department looked into sexual misconduct allegations against President Trump in connection with the sex offender Jeffrey Epstein but did not find credible information to merit further investigation, Todd Blanche, the deputy attorney general, said on Sunday.</p>
<p>Mr. Blanche’s comments, which he made on CNN’s “State of the Union,” came less than 48 hours after the Trump administration released about three million pages of documents collected by the Justice Department as part of its yearslong investigation into Mr. Epstein, who died in 2019.</p>
<p>The controversy over Mr. Epstein has dogged Mr. Trump for the past year. After Mr. Trump’s allies vowed on the 2024 campaign trail to release the Epstein files, his administration rapidly backtracked. Mr. Trump’s resistance to releasing the government’s files fueled speculation that they contained damaging information about him or his allies.</p>
<p>The files are peppered with references to Mr. Trump, who had been a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/18/us/jeffrey-epstein-donald-trump.html">close friend of Mr. Epstein’s</a> until the early 2000s. While Mr. Trump has repeatedly downplayed the relationship, the two men bonded over their pursuit of young women. Mr. Trump has denied any wrongdoing in connection to Mr. Epstein.</p>
<p>Using a proprietary search tool, The New York Times identified more than 5,300 files containing more than 38,000 references to Mr. Trump, his wife, his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida, and other related words and phrases in the latest batch of emails, government files, videos and other records released by the Justice Department. Previous installments of the Epstein files, which the department released late last year, included another 130 files with Trump-related references.</p>
<p>Many of the documents released on Friday that mention Mr. Trump are news articles and other publicly available materials that had landed in Mr. Epstein’s email inbox. None of those files include any direct communication between Mr. Trump and Mr. Epstein. (Few of the files date back as far as the early 2000s, when the two men were friends.)</p>
