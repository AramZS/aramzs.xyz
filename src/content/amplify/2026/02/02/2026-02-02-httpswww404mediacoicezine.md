<p>We are very proud to present 404 Media’s zine on the surveillance technology used by Immigrations and Customs Enforcement. While we have always covered surveillance and privacy, for the last year, you may have noticed that we have spent an outsized amount of our attention and time reporting on the ways technology companies are powering Donald Trump’s deportation raids.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.404media.co/404-media-is-making-a-zine/"><u>When we announced this zine in early December</u></a>, we hoped that people would want it. Trump’s dehumanizing mass deportation campaign is perhaps the bleakest, most horrifying aspect of an administration that has reveled in its attacks on civil liberties, science, and government expertise. We did not know just how many of you would want a copy. We originally intended to print 1,000 copies, and to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/lafightsback_/?ref=404media.co"><u>hand most of them out at a benefit concert</u></a> in Los Angeles for CHIRLA, a human rights organization that helps immigrants. When those sold out in a few hours, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/punchkisspress/?ref=404media.co"><u>we asked Punch Kiss Press</u></a>, our printer, if they could make 2,500. When those sold out just as fast, we increased our order to 3,500. <strong>If you preordered a print zine, I put it in the mail last week and it should be arriving soon.</strong> Thank you everyone for your patience in waiting for the zine and we’d love to know what you think of it. We have a handful more copies that we’ve put up for sale <a href="https://404media.myshopify.com/products/presale-ice-surveillance-zine?ref=404media.co"><u>on our Shopify</u></a>. They will almost certainly sell out today and we will probably not reprint them.</p>
<p>We never intended to make this zine a scarce resource. We wanted to make a print product as an experiment for the reasons <a href="https://www.404media.co/404-media-is-making-a-zine/"><u>we explained when we announced it</u></a>: Print is cool, it’s human, it’s enduring, and it’s shareable.</p>
<p>Each of these zines was printed, assembled, and cut down to size by hand, and each of them was stuck in the mail by me or a friend of mine over the course of the last few weeks. We printed this on a riso printer, a Japanese duplicator from the early 1990s that anyone who is into <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CIdrgb1Bz-m/?hl=en&amp;ref=404media.co"><u>will talk your ear off about endlessly</u></a>, to the point that it has become a meme. I also printed all the envelopes on a riso printer from 1995 that I have painstakingly spent the last few months repairing. Basically, making and shipping these was labor intensive and DIY by design; we never thought we would need to print so many. They were made with a considerable amount of love. And for this first one, we don’t really have the capability to make and ship more than we’ve already made.</p>

<p>So for that reason, we’re releasing a PDF of the zine for free to everyone, because we think the information contained within it is important and should be shared as widely as possible. We have also paid to have the zine translated into Spanish by human translators, thanks in part to a donation from one of our subscribers. You can find the Spanish version of the zine here. If you have a riso printer or are a riso print shop and are interested in printing additional copies at scale to distribute to your community, please email me and I may be able to share the print files with you.</p>
<p>We could not have made this zine without the support of our subscribers, our friends, and our local community. The zine was <a href="https://www.404media.co/the-weird-way-the-404-media-zine-was-built/"><u>laid out by our friend Ernie Smith</u></a>, who is one of the best to ever do it. The <a href="https://www.instagram.com/veridreamy/?ref=404media.co"><u>cover art was done by Veri Alvarez</u></a>, whose work you can find here and whose anti-ICE art is frankly very fucking good and who deserves your support. The printing and assembly of the zine was <a href="https://www.instagram.com/punchkisspress/?ref=404media.co"><u>done by Karina Richardson at Punch Kiss Press</u></a> in Los Angeles and a few of her friends. I met Karina at a print festival in Los Angeles a few months ago and then asked her if she could take on this very complicated project on a short timeline. I then asked her to more than triple the number of copies, all over the holidays. It cannot be overstated how much Karina and Punch Kiss knocked it out of the park on this, and how thankful we are to her. And we made the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/lafightsback_/?__d=dist&amp;ref=404media.co"><u>zine to support LA Fights Back</u></a>, a concert series dedicated to raising money for communities affected by ICE. We are thankful that we were invited to participate.</p>
<p>This being a print product, our work has been frozen in time. We wrote these pieces before DHS agents <a href="https://www.404media.co/dhs-is-lying-to-you-about-ice-shooting-a-woman/"><u>killed Renee Good</u></a> and Alex Pretti in Minneapolis, and before <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/28/deaths-ice-2026-?ref=404media.co"><u>several other people</u></a> died in ICE custody in the last few weeks. The horrors we are facing are evolving and changing every day and we are committed to continuing to cover the ways that big tech and the surveillance state empowers ICE. You can <a href="https://www.404media.co/tag/ice/"><u>find most of our most recent work on ICE here</u></a>:</p>
<p>We’ve been overwhelmed and heartened by the support and interest in our reporting and in this zine. This project was a lot of work, and we’ve learned a lot about making and distributing a physical product at scale. We don’t have anything concrete to announce yet but I think we’d love to do more print products and issues in the future. So if you liked this please let us know. If you want to support our work specifically, the <a href="https://www.404media.co/membership/"><u>best thing you can do is subscribe to 404 Media</u></a>. We also have a <a href="https://www.404media.co/tip-jar/"><u>tip jar</u></a> and, if you are interested in making a larger tax-deductible donation, please email us at donate@404media.co.</p>
