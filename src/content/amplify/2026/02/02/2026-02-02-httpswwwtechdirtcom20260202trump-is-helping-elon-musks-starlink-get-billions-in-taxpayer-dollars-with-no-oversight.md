<h3>from the <i>privatize-the-profits,-socialize-the-losses</i> dept</h3>
<p>We’ve long noted how the 2021 infrastructure bill included <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2025/02/27/the-trump-admin-thinks-affordable-fiber-broadband-is-woke/">$42.5 billion for broadband</a> grants dubbed the Broadband, Equity, Access And Deployment (BEAD) program. The <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2025/04/01/jon-stewart-and-ezra-klein-help-gop-paint-infrastructure-bill-broadband-grants-as-a-useless-boondoggle/">program wasn’t without its warts</a>, but it had the potential to be truly transformative for U.S. broadband access.</p>
<p>But Republicans illegally rewrote the program to redirect money <strong>away</strong> from stuff like affordable, gigabit, community fiber, and <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2025/05/30/republicans-rewrite-infrastructure-broadband-grant-program-to-give-elon-musk-billions-potentially-delaying-deployments-by-years/">into the pockets of billionaire Elon Musk</a>. In exchange for <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2025/07/31/study-shows-musks-starlink-too-congested-to-tackle-u-s-broadband-woes-despite-billions-in-new-subsidies/">congested</a>, expensive, Low-Earth-Orbit (LEO) satellite broadband access the company <em>planned to deploy anyway</em>.</p>
<p>This alone was a pretty big grift. But Trump has <strong>also</strong> threatened to illegally withhold planed state broadband grants if they dare <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2025/07/28/trump-threatens-to-withold-billions-from-states-that-try-to-make-broadband-affordable-to-poor-people/">try to make sure the resulting taxpayer broadband is affordable</a>, or attempt to hold companies accountable for failing to delivered promised service.</p>
<p>When states like Virginia have balked at the idea of prioritizing Elon Musk’s satellite service over more reliable fiber, Starlink has <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2025/08/20/musks-starlink-gets-mad-at-the-state-of-virginia-for-refusing-to-shower-it-with-broadband-subsidies-it-doesnt-deserve/">cried and pouted like a petulant child</a>. More recently, Starlink has been attempting to attach a rider to its grant agreements with states, saying they can’t be held responsible <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/starlink-demands-grant-money-from-states-even-when-residents-dont-buy-service/">if the broadband Starlink provides is slow, expensive, or not installed properly</a>:</p>
<blockquote> <p><em>“The concessions sought by SpaceX “would limit Starlink’s performance obligations, payment schedules, non-compliance penalties, reporting expectations, and labor and insurance standards,” wrote Drew Garner, director of policy engagement at the Benton Institute. Garner argued that SpaceX’s demands illustrate problems in how the Trump NTIA rewrote program rules to increase reliance on low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellite providers.”</em></p> </blockquote>
<p>So basically Musk — who likes to <a href="https://futurism.com/elon-musk-starlink-grant-rejection-subsidies">pretend he hates subsidies</a> despite his <a href="https://futurism.com/elon-musk-starlink-grant-rejection-subsidies">entire existence being propped up by them</a> — wants untold billions in new subsidies <strong>and</strong> no serious way for his company to be held accountable should it fail to deliver the promised, substandard product.</p>
<p>Under a functional broadband grant program, states would push fiber as deeply into rural communities as possible, ideally in the form of <a href="https://copia.is/news/just-a-click-away-how-to-improve-broadband-competition/">“open access” fiber networks</a> that generate local competition and challenge regional monopolies by dramatically lowering the cost of market entry. From there, you’d address the rest of the gaps using fixed wireless and 5G.</p>
<p>Only <strong>then</strong> would you fill in the remaining holes with Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite broadband options like Starlink, which are ideally suited only for the most remote areas (and even then, Starlink is generally too expensive for most of the lower-income rural Americans who really need it).</p>
<p>Under an ideal program, you’d also confirm that the companies you’re giving taxpayer money to <strong>can actually deliver what they’re promising</strong>. The Trump FCC <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/06/28/the-trump-fcc-wasted-millions-in-broadband-subsidies-in-a-giant-mess-government-is-still-trying-to-clean-up/">didn’t do that with an earlier program</a> (the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund, RDOF), resulting in a whole bunch of companies (including Musk’s Starlink) <a href="https://www.freepress.net/blog/space-x-broadband-coming-empty-traffic-island-near-you">gaming the system to try and get money for projects they didn’t deserve or couldn’t finish</a>.</p>
<p>Republicans have, in an open act of corruption, thrown this entire logic on its head to curry favor with their favorite white supremacist extremist billionaire. They’re prioritizing Elon Musk’s substandard satellite network (which will <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2025/07/31/study-shows-musks-starlink-too-congested-to-tackle-u-s-broadband-woes-despite-billions-in-new-subsidies/">only become more congested as more people use it</a>), then ensuring nobody can meaningful hold Musk accountable when he inevitably fails to deliver reliable, affordable access.</p>
<p>Who is going to hold Musk accountable if he fails to deliver? Trump’s bootlicker at the FCC, Brendan Carr? The FTC, where Trump <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2025/03/19/trump-illegally-purges-ftcs-democratic-commissioners-gutting-whats-left-of-agency-independence/">illegally fired all the Dem Commissioners</a>? The NTIA, which is now run by a former Ted Cruz staffer who thinks affordable fiber optic broadband is “<a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2025/02/27/the-trump-admin-thinks-affordable-fiber-broadband-is-woke/">woke</a>?” States, who risk losing out on a generational influx of subsidies if they challenge Elon Musk’s greed or stand up to telecoms?</p>
<p>Musk’s DOGE was always about destroying the regulatory state so he and other billionaires could sell the country for scrap off the back loading dock under the pretense of innovative efficiencies while being slathered with tax cuts and subsides. It’s grotesque, historic levels of corruption in a fucking hat.</p>
<p>You might recall, folks like <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2025/04/01/jon-stewart-and-ezra-klein-help-gop-paint-infrastructure-bill-broadband-grants-as-a-useless-boondoggle/">Ezra Klein made a big, extended stink about the fact this original BEAD program was taking a long time to deliver</a> (for some <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2025/04/01/jon-stewart-and-ezra-klein-help-gop-paint-infrastructure-bill-broadband-grants-as-a-useless-boondoggle/">obvious reasons</a>). But since Elon Musk hijacked the program creating a lot of headaches, wasted money, and entirely new delays, I curiously haven’t heard the “abundance” folks make a single, solitary peep.</p>
<p>The business and telecom press (and many folks in policy circles) have also already seemingly normalized hijacking a massive subsidy program to the benefit of a white supremacist billionaire. But as somebody that’s been studying the challenges of broadband access for a quarter century, I guarantee that we’re going to be documenting the damage (and lost potential) of this corruption for decades to come.</p>
