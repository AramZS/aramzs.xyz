  The women's liberation movement favored "structureless" groups to avoid
  oppression but this led to hidden informal power and exclusion. Without clear,
  formal organization, informal elites control decisions secretly, limiting true
  participation. To grow and be fair, the movement must accept some structure
  while avoiding rigid, traditional models.

          earliest version of this article was given as a talk at a conference
          called by the Southern Female Rights Union, held in Beulah, Mississippi
          in May 1970. It was written up for <u>Notes from the Third Year</u> (1971),
          but the editors did not use it. It was then submitted to several movement
          publications, but only one asked permission to publish it; others did
          so without permission. The first official place of publication was
          in Vol. 2, No. 1 of <u>The Second Wave</u> (1972). This early version
          in movement publications was authored by Joreen. Different versions
          were published in the <u>Berkeley Journal of Sociology</u>, Vol. 17,
          1972-73, pp. 151-165, and <u>Ms.</u> magazine, July 1973, pp. 76-78,
          86-89, authored by Jo Freeman. This piece spread all over the world.
          Numerous people have edited, reprinted, cut, and translated "Tyranny" for
          magazines, books and web sites, usually without the permission or knowledge
          of the author. The version below is a blend of the three cited here. </font><br/>

        the years in which the women's liberation movement has been taking shape, 
        a great emphasis has been placed on what are called leaderless, structureless 
        groups as the main -- if not sole -- organizational form of the movement. 
        The source of this idea was a natural reaction against the over-structured 
        society in which most of us found ourselves, and the inevitable control 
        this gave others over our lives, and the continual elitism of the Left 
        and similar groups among those who were supposedly fighting this overstructuredness.<br/>
<img align="left" alt="" border="0" height="10" hspace="0" src="https://readwise.io/reader/imgproxy?url=http%3A//www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif&amp;hash=f4d1a8a593cb888c4a6cfa1ba1bdb9cc" vspace="0" width="15"/>The 
        idea of "structurelessness," however, has moved from a healthy 
        counter to those tendencies to becoming a goddess in its own right. The 
        idea is as little examined as the term is much used, but it has become 
        an intrinsic and unquestioned part of women's liberation ideology. For 
        the early development of the movement this did not much matter. It early 
        defined its main goal, and its main method, as consciousness-raising, 
        and the "structureless" rap group was an excellent means to 
        this end. The looseness and informality of it encouraged participation 
        in discussion, and its often supportive atmosphere elicited personal insight. 
        If nothing more concrete than personal insight ever resulted from these 
        groups, that did not much matter, because their purpose did not really 
        extend beyond this.<br/>

          basic problems didn't appear until individual rap groups exhausted
          the virtues of consciousness-raising and decided they wanted to do
          something more specific. At this point they usually foundered because
          most groups were unwilling to change their structure when they changed
          their tasks. Women had thoroughly accepted the idea of "structurelessness" without
          realizing the limitations of its uses. People would try to use the "structureless" group
          and the informal conference for purposes for which they were unsuitable
          out of a blind belief that no other means could possibly be anything
          but oppressive.<br/>
<img align="left" alt="" border="0" height="10" hspace="0" src="https://readwise.io/reader/imgproxy?url=http%3A//www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif&amp;hash=f4d1a8a593cb888c4a6cfa1ba1bdb9cc" vspace="0" width="15"/>If
          the movement is to grow beyond these elementary stages of development,
          it will have to disabuse itself of some of its prejudices about organization
          and structure. There is nothing inherently bad about either of these.
          They can be and often are misused, but to reject them out of hand because
          they are misused is to deny ourselves the necessary tools to further
          development. We need to understand why "structurelessness" does
      not work.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">FORMAL 
        AND INFORMAL STRUCTURES</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><img align="left" alt="" border="0" height="10" hspace="0" src="https://readwise.io/reader/imgproxy?url=http%3A//www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif&amp;hash=f4d1a8a593cb888c4a6cfa1ba1bdb9cc" vspace="0" width="15"/>Contrary 
        to what we would like to believe, there is no such thing as a structureless 
        group. Any group of people of whatever nature that comes together for 
        any length of time for any purpose will inevitably structure itself in 
        some fashion. The structure may be flexible; it may vary over time; it 
        may evenly or unevenly distribute tasks, power and resources over the 
        members of the group. But it will be formed regardless of the abilities, 
        personalities, or intentions of the people involved. The very fact that 
        we are individuals, with different talents, predispositions, and backgrounds 
        makes this inevitable. Only if we refused to relate or interact on any 
        basis whatsoever could we approximate structurelessness -- and that is 
        not the nature of a human group.<br/>
<img align="left" alt="" border="0" height="10" hspace="0" src="https://readwise.io/reader/imgproxy?url=http%3A//www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif&amp;hash=f4d1a8a593cb888c4a6cfa1ba1bdb9cc" vspace="0" width="15"/>This 
        means that to strive for a structureless group is as useful, and as deceptive, 
        as to aim at an "objective" news story, "value-free" 
        social science, or a "free" economy. A "laissez faire" 
        group is about as realistic as a "laissez faire" society; the 
        idea becomes a smokescreen for the strong or the lucky to establish unquestioned 
        hegemony over others. This hegemony can be so easily established because 
        the idea of "structurelessness" does not prevent the formation 
        of informal structures, only formal ones. Similarly "laissez faire" 
        philosophy did not prevent the economically powerful from establishing 
        control over wages, prices, and distribution of goods; it only prevented 
        the government from doing so. Thus structurelessness becomes a way of 
        masking power, and within the women's movement is usually most strongly 
        advocated by those who are the most powerful (whether they are conscious 
        of their power or not). As long as the structure of the group is informal, 
        the rules of how decisions are made are known only to a few and awareness 
        of power is limited to those who know the rules. Those who do not know 
        the rules and are not chosen for initiation must remain in confusion, 
        or suffer from paranoid delusions that something is happening of which 
        they are not quite aware.<br/>

          everyone to have the opportunity to be involved in a given group and
          to participate in its activities the structure must be explicit, not
          implicit. The rules of decision-making must be open and available to
          everyone, and this can happen only if they are formalized. This is
          not to say that formalization of a structure of a group will destroy
          the informal structure. It usually doesn't. But it does hinder the
          informal structure from having predominant control and make available
          some means of attacking it if the people involved are not at least
          responsible to the needs of the group at large. "Structurelessness" is
          organizationally impossible. We cannot decide whether to have a structured
          or structureless group, only whether or not to have a formally structured
          one. Therefore the word will not be used any longer except to refer
          to the idea it represents. Unstructured will refer to those groups
          which have not been deliberately structured in a particular manner.
          Structured will refer to those which have. A Structured group always
          has formal structure, and may also have an informal, or covert, structure.
          It is this informal structure, particularly in Unstructured groups,
          which forms the basis for elites.</font></p>

        NATURE OF ELITISM</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><img align="left" alt="" border="0" height="10" hspace="0" src="https://readwise.io/reader/imgproxy?url=http%3A//www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif&amp;hash=f4d1a8a593cb888c4a6cfa1ba1bdb9cc" vspace="0" width="15"/>"Elitist" 
        is probably the most abused word in the women's liberation movement. It 
        is used as frequently, and for the same reasons, as "pinko" 
        was used in the fifties. It is rarely used correctly. Within the movement 
        it commonly refers to individuals, though the personal characteristics 
        and activities of those to whom it is directed may differ widely: An individual, 
        as an individual can never be an elitist, because the only proper application 
        of the term "elite" is to groups. Any individual, regardless 
        of how well-known that person may be, can never be an elite.<br/>
<img align="left" alt="" border="0" height="10" hspace="0" src="https://readwise.io/reader/imgproxy?url=http%3A//www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif&amp;hash=f4d1a8a593cb888c4a6cfa1ba1bdb9cc" vspace="0" width="15"/>Correctly, 
        an elite refers to a small group of people who have power over a larger 
        group of which they are part, usually without direct responsibility to 
        that larger group, and often without their knowledge or consent. A person 
        becomes an elitist by being part of, or advocating the rule by, such a 
        small group, whether or not that individual is well known or not known 
        at all. Notoriety is not a definition of an elitist. The most insidious 
        elites are usually run by people not known to the larger public at all. 
        Intelligent elitists are usually smart enough not to allow themselves 
        to become well known; when they become known, they are watched, and the 
        mask over their power is no longer firmly lodged.<br/>
<img align="left" alt="" border="0" height="10" hspace="0" src="https://readwise.io/reader/imgproxy?url=http%3A//www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif&amp;hash=f4d1a8a593cb888c4a6cfa1ba1bdb9cc" vspace="0" width="15"/>Elites 
        are not conspiracies. Very seldom does a small group of people get together 
        and deliberately try to take over a larger group for its own ends. Elites 
        are nothing more, and nothing less, than groups of friends who also happen 
        to participate in the same political activities. They would probably maintain 
        their friendship whether or not they were involved in political activities; 
        they would probably be involved in political activities whether or not 
        they maintained their friendships. It is the coincidence of these two 
        phenomena which creates elites in any group and makes them so difficult 
        to break.<br/>
<img align="left" alt="" border="0" height="10" hspace="0" src="https://readwise.io/reader/imgproxy?url=http%3A//www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif&amp;hash=f4d1a8a593cb888c4a6cfa1ba1bdb9cc" vspace="0" width="15"/>These 
        friendship groups function as networks of communication outside any regular 
        channels for such communication that may have been set up by a group. 
        If no channels are set up, they function as the only networks of communication. 
        Because people are friends, because they usually share the same values 
        and orientations, because they talk to each other socially and consult 
        with each other when common decisions have to be made, the people involved 
        in these networks have more power in the group than those who don't. And 
        it is a rare group that does not establish some informal networks of communication 
        through the friends that are made in it.<br/>
<img align="left" alt="" border="0" height="10" hspace="0" src="https://readwise.io/reader/imgproxy?url=http%3A//www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif&amp;hash=f4d1a8a593cb888c4a6cfa1ba1bdb9cc" vspace="0" width="15"/>Some 
        groups, depending on their size, may have more than one such informal 
        communications network. Networks may even overlap. When only one such 
        network exists, it is the elite of an otherwise Unstructured group, whether 
        the participants in it want to be elitists or not. If it is the only such 
        network in a Structured group it may or may not be an elite depending 
        on its composition and the nature of the formal Structure. If there are 
        two or more such networks of friends, they may compete for power within 
        the group, thus forming factions, or one may deliberately opt out of the 
        competition, leaving the other as the elite. In a Structured group, two 
        or more such friendship networks usually compete with each other for formal 
        power. This is often the healthiest situation, as the other members are 
        in a position to arbitrate between the two competitors for power and thus 
        to make demands on those to whom they give their temporary allegiance.<br/>
<img align="left" alt="" border="0" height="10" hspace="0" src="https://readwise.io/reader/imgproxy?url=http%3A//www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif&amp;hash=f4d1a8a593cb888c4a6cfa1ba1bdb9cc" vspace="0" width="15"/>The 
        inevitably elitist and exclusive nature of informal communication networks 
        of friends is neither a new phenomenon characteristic of the women's movement 
        nor a phenomenon new to women. Such informal relationships have excluded 
        women for centuries from participating in integrated groups of which they 
        were a part. In any profession or organization these networks have created 
        the "locker room" mentality and the "old school" ties 
        which have effectively prevented women as a group (as well as some men 
        individually) from having equal access to the sources of power or social 
        reward. Much of the energy of past women's movements has been directed 
        to having the structures of decision-making and the selection processes 
        formalized so that the exclusion of women could be confronted directly. 
        As we well know, these efforts have not prevented the informal male-only 
        networks from discriminating against women, but they have made it more 
        difficult.<br/>
<img align="left" alt="" border="0" height="10" hspace="0" src="https://readwise.io/reader/imgproxy?url=http%3A//www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif&amp;hash=f4d1a8a593cb888c4a6cfa1ba1bdb9cc" vspace="0" width="15"/>Because 
        elites are informal does not mean they are invisible. At any small group 
        meeting anyone with a sharp eye and an acute ear can tell who is influencing 
        whom. The members of a friendship group will relate more to each other 
        than to other people. They listen more attentively, and interrupt less; 
        they repeat each other's points and give in amiably; they tend to ignore 
        or grapple with the "outs" whose approval is not necessary for 
        making a decision. But it is necessary for the "outs" to stay 
        on good terms with the "ins." Of course the lines are not as 
        sharp as I have drawn them. They are nuances of interaction, not prewritten 
        scripts. But they are discernible, and they do have their effect. Once 
        one knows with whom it is important to check before a decision is made, 
        and whose approval is the stamp of acceptance, one knows who is running 
        things.<br/>
<img align="left" alt="" border="0" height="10" hspace="0" src="https://readwise.io/reader/imgproxy?url=http%3A//www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif&amp;hash=f4d1a8a593cb888c4a6cfa1ba1bdb9cc" vspace="0" width="15"/>Since 
        movement groups have made no concrete decisions about who shall exercise 
        power within them, many different criteria are used around the country. 
        Most criteria are along the lines of traditional female characteristics. 
        For instance, in the early days of the movement, marriage was usually 
        a prerequisite for participation in the informal elite. As women have 
        been traditionally taught, married women relate primarily to each other, 
        and look upon single women as too threatening to have as close friends. 
        In many cities, this criterion was further refined to include only those 
        women married to New Left men. This standard had more than tradition behind 
        it, however, because New Left men often had access to resources needed 
        by the movement -- such as mailing lists, printing presses, contacts, 
        and information -- and women were used to getting what they needed through 
        men rather than independently. As the movement has charged through time, 
        marriage has become a less universal criterion for effective participation, 
        but all informal elites establish standards by which only women who possess 
        certain material or personal characteristics may join. They frequently 
        include: middle-class background (despite all the rhetoric about relating 
        to the working class); being married; not being married but living with 
        someone; being or pretending to be a lesbian; being between the ages of 
        twenty and thirty; being college educated or at least having some college 
        background; being "hip"; not being too "hip"; holding 
        a certain political line or identification as a "radical"; having 
        children or at least liking them; not having children; having certain 
        "feminine" personality characteristics such as being "nice"; 
        dressing right (whether in the traditional style or the antitraditional 
        style); etc. There are also some characteristics which will almost always 
        tag one as a "deviant" who should not be related to. They include: 
        being too old; working full time, particularly if one is actively committed 
        to a "career"; not being "nice"; and being avowedly 
        single (i.e., neither actively heterosexual nor homosexual).<br/>
<img align="left" alt="" border="0" height="10" hspace="0" src="https://readwise.io/reader/imgproxy?url=http%3A//www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif&amp;hash=f4d1a8a593cb888c4a6cfa1ba1bdb9cc" vspace="0" width="15"/>Other 
        criteria could be included, but they all have common themes. The characteristics 
        prerequisite for participating in the informal elites of the movement, 
        and thus for exercising power, concern one's background, personality, 
        or allocation of time. They do not include one's competence, dedication 
        to feminism, talents, or potential contribution to the movement. The former 
        are the criteria one usually uses in determining one's friends. The latter 
        are what any movement or organization has to use if it is going to be 
        politically effective.<br/>
<img align="left" alt="" border="0" height="10" hspace="0" src="https://readwise.io/reader/imgproxy?url=http%3A//www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif&amp;hash=f4d1a8a593cb888c4a6cfa1ba1bdb9cc" vspace="0" width="15"/>The 
        criteria of participation may differ from group to group, but the means 
        of becoming a member of the informal elite if one meets those criteria 
        art pretty much the same. The only main difference depends on whether 
        one is in a group from the beginning, or joins it after it has begun. 
        If involved from the beginning it is important to have as many of one's 
        personal friends as possible also join. If no one knows anyone else very 
        well, then one must deliberately form friendships with a select number 
        and establish the informal interaction patterns crucial to the creation 
        of an informal structure. Once the informal patterns are formed they act 
        to maintain themselves, and one of the most successful tactics of maintenance 
        is to continuously recruit new people who "fit in." One joins 
        such an elite much the same way one pledges a sorority. If perceived as 
        a potential addition, one is "rushed" by the members of the 
        informal structure and eventually either dropped or initiated. If the 
        sorority is not politically aware enough to actively engage in this process 
        itself it can be started by the outsider pretty much the same way one 
        joins any private club. Find a sponsor, i.e., pick some member of the 
        elite who appears to be well respected within it, and actively cultivate 
        that person's friendship. Eventually, she will most likely bring you into 
        the inner circle.<br/>

          of these procedures take time. So if one works full time or has a similar
          major commitment, it is usually impossible to join simply because there
          are not enough hours left to go to all the meetings and cultivate the
          personal relationship necessary to have a voice in the decision-making.
          That is why formal structures of decision making are a boon to the
          overworked person. Having an established process for decision-making
          ensures that everyone can participate in it to some extent.<br/>
<img align="left" alt="" border="0" height="10" hspace="0" src="https://readwise.io/reader/imgproxy?url=http%3A//www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif&amp;hash=f4d1a8a593cb888c4a6cfa1ba1bdb9cc" vspace="0" width="15"/>Although
          this dissection of the process of elite formation within small groups
          has been critical in perspective, it is not made in the belief that
          these informal structures are inevitably bad -- merely inevitable.
          All groups create informal structures as a result of interaction patterns
          among the members of the group. Such informal structures can do very
          useful things But only Unstructured groups are totally governed by
          them. When informal elites are combined with a myth of "structurelessness," there
          can be no attempt to put limits on the use of power. It becomes capricious.<br/>
<img align="left" alt="" border="0" height="10" hspace="0" src="https://readwise.io/reader/imgproxy?url=http%3A//www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif&amp;hash=f4d1a8a593cb888c4a6cfa1ba1bdb9cc" vspace="0" width="15"/>This
          has two potentially negative consequences of which we should be aware.
          The first is that the informal structure of decision-making will be
          much like a sorority -- one in which people listen to others because
          they like them and not because they say significant things. As long
          as the movement does not do significant things this does not much matter.
          But if its development is not to be arrested at this preliminary stage,
          it will have to alter this trend. The second is that informal structures
          have no obligation to be responsible to the group at large. Their power
          was not given to them; it cannot be taken away. Their influence is
          not based on what they do for the group; therefore they cannot be directly
          influenced by the group. This does not necessarily make informal structures
          irresponsible. Those who are concerned with maintaining their influence
          will usually try to be responsible. The group simply cannot compel
      such responsibility; it is dependent on the interests of the elite.</font></p>

        THE "STAR" SYSTEM</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><img align="left" alt="" border="0" height="10" hspace="0" src="https://readwise.io/reader/imgproxy?url=http%3A//www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif&amp;hash=f4d1a8a593cb888c4a6cfa1ba1bdb9cc" vspace="0" width="15"/>The 
        idea of "structurelessness" has created the "star" 
        system. We live in a society which expects political groups to make decisions 
        and to select people to articulate those decisions to the public at large. 
        The press and the public do not know how to listen seriously to individual 
        women as women; they want to know how the group feels. Only three techniques 
        have ever been developed for establishing mass group opinion: the vote 
        or referendum, the public opinion survey questionnaire, and the selection 
        of group spokespeople at an appropriate meeting. The women's liberation 
        movement has used none of these to communicate with the public. Neither 
        the movement as a whole nor most of the multitudinous groups within it 
        have established a means of explaining their position on various issues. 
        But the public is conditioned to look for spokespeople.<br/>
<img align="left" alt="" border="0" height="10" hspace="0" src="https://readwise.io/reader/imgproxy?url=http%3A//www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif&amp;hash=f4d1a8a593cb888c4a6cfa1ba1bdb9cc" vspace="0" width="15"/>While 
        it has consciously not chosen spokespeople, the movement has thrown up 
        many women who have caught the public eye for varying reasons. These women 
        represent no particular group or established opinion; they know this and 
        usually say so. But because there are no official spokespeople nor any 
        decision-making body that the press can query when it wants to know the 
        movement's position on a subject, these women are perceived as the spokespeople. 
        Thus, whether they want to or not, whether the movement likes it or not, 
        women of public note are put in the role of spokespeople by default.<br/>
<img align="left" alt="" border="0" height="10" hspace="0" src="https://readwise.io/reader/imgproxy?url=http%3A//www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif&amp;hash=f4d1a8a593cb888c4a6cfa1ba1bdb9cc" vspace="0" width="15"/>This 
        is one main source of the ire that is often felt toward the women who 
        are labeled "stars." Because they were not selected by the women 
        in the movement to represent the movement's views, they are resented when 
        the press presumes that they speak for the movement. But as long as the 
        movement does not select its own spokeswomen, such women will be placed 
        in that role by the press and the public, regardless of their own desires.<br/>
<img align="left" alt="" border="0" height="10" hspace="0" src="https://readwise.io/reader/imgproxy?url=http%3A//www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif&amp;hash=f4d1a8a593cb888c4a6cfa1ba1bdb9cc" vspace="0" width="15"/>This 
        has several negative consequences for both the movement and the women 
        labeled "stars." First, because the movement didn't put them 
        in the role of spokesperson, the movement cannot remove them. The press 
        put them there and only the press can choose not to listen. The press 
        will continue to look to "stars" as spokeswomen as long as it 
        has no official alternatives to go to for authoritative statements from 
        the movement. The movement has no control in the selection of its representatives 
        to the public as long as it believes that it should have no representatives 
        at all. Second, women put in this position often find themselves viciously 
        attacked by their sisters. This achieves nothing for the movement and 
        is painfully destructive to the individuals involved. Such attacks only 
        result in either the woman leaving the movement entirely-often bitterly 
        alienated -- or in her ceasing to feel responsible to her "sisters." 
        She may maintain some loyalty to the movement, vaguely defined, but she 
        is no longer susceptible to pressures from other women in it. One cannot 
        feel responsible to people who have been the source of such pain without 
        being a masochist, and these women are usually too strong to bow to that 
        kind of personal pressure. Thus the backlash to the "star" system 
        in effect encourages the very kind of individualistic nonresponsibility 
        that the movement condemns. By purging a sister as a "star," 
        the movement loses whatever control it may have had over the person who 
        then becomes free to commit all of the individualistic sins of which she 
      has been accused.</font></p>

        groups may be very effective in getting women to talk about their lives; 
        they aren't very good for getting things done. It is when people get tired 
        of "just talking" and want to do something more that the groups 
        flounder, unless they change the nature of their operation. Occasionally, 
        the developed informal structure of the group coincides with an available 
        need that the group can fill in such a way as to give the appearance that 
        an Unstructured group "works." That is, the group has fortuitously 
        developed precisely the kind of structure best suited for engaging in 
        a particular project. <br/>

        and very hard to replicate. There are almost inevitably four conditions 
        found in such a group;<br/>
</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
<img align="left" alt="" border="0" height="10" hspace="0" src="https://readwise.io/reader/imgproxy?url=http%3A//www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif&amp;hash=f4d1a8a593cb888c4a6cfa1ba1bdb9cc" vspace="0" width="15"/>1)<i> 
        It is task oriented</i>. Its function is very narrow and very specific, 
        like putting on a conference or putting out a newspaper. It is the task 
        that basically structures the group. The task determines what needs to 
        be done and when it needs to be done. It provides a guide by which people 
        can judge their actions and make plans for future activity.<br/>
<img align="left" alt="" border="0" height="10" hspace="0" src="https://readwise.io/reader/imgproxy?url=http%3A//www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif&amp;hash=f4d1a8a593cb888c4a6cfa1ba1bdb9cc" vspace="0" width="15"/>2) 
        <i>It is relatively small and homogeneous</i>. Homogeneity is necessary 
        to insure that participants have a "common language" for interaction. 
        People from widely different backgrounds may provide richness to a consciousness-raising 
        group where each can learn from the others' experience, but too great 
        a diversity among members of a task-oriented group means only that they 
        continually misunderstand each other. Such diverse people interpret words 
        and actions differently. They have different expectations about each other's 
        behavior and judge the results according to different criteria. If everyone 
        knows everyone else well enough to understand the nuances, these can be 
        accommodated. Usually, they only lead to confusion and endless hours spent 
        straightening out conflicts no one ever thought would arise.<br/>
<img align="left" alt="" border="0" height="10" hspace="0" src="https://readwise.io/reader/imgproxy?url=http%3A//www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif&amp;hash=f4d1a8a593cb888c4a6cfa1ba1bdb9cc" vspace="0" width="15"/>3) 
        <i>There is a high degree of communication</i>. Information must be passed 
        on to everyone, opinions checked, work divided up, and participation assured 
        in the relevant decisions. This is only possible if the group is small 
        and people practically live together for the most crucial phases of the 
        task. Needless to say, the number of interactions necessary to involve 
        everybody increases geometrically with the number of participants. This 
        inevitably limits group participants to about five, or excludes some from 
        some of the decisions. Successful groups can be as large as 10 or 15, 
        but only when they are in fact composed of several smaller subgroups which 
        perform specific parts of the task, and whose members overlap with each 
        other so that knowledge of what the different subgroups are doing can 
        be passed around easily.<br/>
<img align="left" alt="" border="0" height="10" hspace="0" src="https://readwise.io/reader/imgproxy?url=http%3A//www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif&amp;hash=f4d1a8a593cb888c4a6cfa1ba1bdb9cc" vspace="0" width="15"/>4) 
        <i>There is a low degree of skill specialization</i>. Not everyone has 
        to be able to do everything, but everything must be able to be done by 
        more than one person. Thus no one is indispensable. To a certain extent, 
        people become interchangeable parts.<br/>
</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
<img align="left" alt="" border="0" height="10" hspace="0" src="https://readwise.io/reader/imgproxy?url=http%3A//www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif&amp;hash=f4d1a8a593cb888c4a6cfa1ba1bdb9cc" vspace="0" width="15"/>While 
        these conditions can occur serendipitously in small groups, this is not 
        possible in large ones. Consequently, because the larger movement in most 
        cities is as unstructured as individual rap groups, it is not too much 
        more effective than the separate groups at specific tasks. The informal 
        structure is rarely together enough or in touch enough with the people 
        to be able to operate effectively. So the movement generates much motion 
        and few results. Unfortunately, the consequences of all this motion are 
        not as innocuous as the results' and their victim is the movement itself.<br/>
<img align="left" alt="" border="0" height="10" hspace="0" src="https://readwise.io/reader/imgproxy?url=http%3A//www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif&amp;hash=f4d1a8a593cb888c4a6cfa1ba1bdb9cc" vspace="0" width="15"/>Some 
        groups have formed themselves into local action projects if they do not 
        involve many people and work on a small scale. But this form restricts 
        movement activity to the local level; it cannot be done on the regional 
        or national. Also, to function well the groups must usually pare themselves 
        down to that informal group of friends who were running things in the 
        first place. This excludes many women from participating. As long as the 
        only way women can participate in the movement is through membership in 
        a small group, the nongregarious are at a distinct disadvantage. As long 
        as friendship groups are the main means of organizational activity, elitism 
        becomes institutionalized.<br/>
<img align="left" alt="" border="0" height="10" hspace="0" src="https://readwise.io/reader/imgproxy?url=http%3A//www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif&amp;hash=f4d1a8a593cb888c4a6cfa1ba1bdb9cc" vspace="0" width="15"/>For 
        those groups which cannot find a local project to which to devote themselves, 
        the mere act of staying together becomes the reason for their staying 
        together. When a group has no specific task (and consciousness raising 
        is a task), the people in it turn their energies to controlling others 
        in the group. This is not done so much out of a malicious desire to manipulate 
        others (though sometimes it is) as out of a lack of anything better to 
        do with their talents. Able people with time on their hands and a need 
        to justify their coming together put their efforts into personal control, 
        and spend their time criticizing the personalities of the other members 
        in the group. Infighting and personal power games rule the day. When a 
        group is involved in a task, people learn to get along with others as 
        they are and to subsume personal dislikes for the sake of the larger goal. 
        There are limits placed on the compulsion to remold every person in our 
        image of what they should be.<br/>

          end of consciousness-raising leaves people with no place to go, and
          the lack of structure leaves them with no way of getting there. The
          women the movement either turn in on themselves and their sisters or
          seek other alternatives of action. There are few that are available.
          Some women just "do their own thing." This can lead to a
          great deal of individual creativity, much of which is useful for the
          movement, but it is not a viable alternative for most women and certainly
          does not foster a spirit of cooperative group effort. Other women drift
          out of the movement entirely because they don't want to develop an
          individual project and they have found no way of discovering, joining,
          or starting group projects that interest them.<br/>
<img align="left" alt="" border="0" height="10" hspace="0" src="https://readwise.io/reader/imgproxy?url=http%3A//www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif&amp;hash=f4d1a8a593cb888c4a6cfa1ba1bdb9cc" vspace="0" width="15"/>Many
          turn to other political organizations to give them the kind of structured,
          effective activity that they have not been able to find in the women's
          movement. Those political organizations which see women's liberation
          as only one of many issues to which women should devote their time
          thus find the movement a vast recruiting ground for new members. There
          is no need for such organizations to "infiltrate" (though
          this is not precluded). The desire for meaningful political activity
          generated in women by their becoming part of the women's liberation
          movement is sufficient to make them eager to join other organizations
          when the movement itself provides no outlets for their new ideas and
          energies. Those women who join other political organizations while
          remaining within the women's liberation movement, or who join women's
          liberation while remaining in other political organizations, in turn
          become the framework for new informal structures. These friendship
          networks are based upon their common nonfeminist politics rather than
          the characteristics discussed earlier, but operate in much the same
          way. Because these women share common values, ideas, and political
          orientations, they too become informal, unplanned, unselected, unresponsible
          elites -- whether they intend to be so or not.<br/>
<img align="left" alt="" border="0" height="10" hspace="0" src="https://readwise.io/reader/imgproxy?url=http%3A//www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif&amp;hash=f4d1a8a593cb888c4a6cfa1ba1bdb9cc" vspace="0" width="15"/>These
          new informal elites are often perceived as threats by the old informal
          elites previously developed within different movement groups. This
          is a correct perception. Such politically oriented networks are rarely
          willing to be merely "sororities" as many of the old ones
          were, and want to proselytize their political as well as their feminist
          ideas. This is only natural, but its implications for women's liberation
          have never been adequately discussed. The old elites are rarely willing
          to bring such differences of opinion out into the open because it would
          involve exposing the nature of the informal structure of the group.<br/>
<img align="left" alt="" border="0" height="10" hspace="0" src="https://readwise.io/reader/imgproxy?url=http%3A//www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif&amp;hash=f4d1a8a593cb888c4a6cfa1ba1bdb9cc" vspace="0" width="15"/>Many
          of these informal elites have been hiding under the banner of "anti-elitism" and "structurelessness." To
          effectively counter the competition from another informal structure,
          they would have to become "public," and this possibility
          is fraught with many dangerous implications. Thus, to maintain its
          own power, it is easier to rationalize the exclusion of the members
          of the other informal structure by such means as "red-baiting," "reformist-baiting," "lesbian-baiting," or "straight-baiting." The
          only other alternative is to formally structure the group in such a
          way that the original power structure is institutionalized. This is
          not always possible. If the informal elites have been well structured
          and have exercised a fair amount of power in the past, such a task
          is feasible. These groups have a history of being somewhat politically
          effective in the past, as the tightness of the informal structure has
          proven an adequate substitute for a formal structure. Becoming Structured
          does not alter their operation much, though the institutionalization
          of the power structure does open it to formal challenge. It is those
          groups which are in greatest need of structure that are often least
          capable of creating it. Their informal structures have not been too
          well formed and adherence to the ideology of "structurelessness" makes
          them reluctant to change tactics. The more Unstructured a group is,
          the more lacking it is in informal structures, and the more it adheres
          to an ideology of "structurelessness," the more vulnerable
          it is to being taken over by a group of political comrades.<br/>
<img align="left" alt="" border="0" height="10" hspace="0" src="https://readwise.io/reader/imgproxy?url=http%3A//www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif&amp;hash=f4d1a8a593cb888c4a6cfa1ba1bdb9cc" vspace="0" width="15"/>Since
          the movement at large is just as Unstructured as most of its constituent
          groups, it is similarly susceptible to indirect influence. But the
          phenomenon manifests itself differently. On a local level most groups
          can operate autonomously; but the only groups that can organize a national
          activity are nationally organized groups. Thus, it is often the Structured
          feminist organizations that provide national direction for feminist
          activities, and this direction is determined by the priorities of those
          organizations. Such groups as NOW, WEAL, and some leftist women's caucuses
          are simply the only organizations capable of mounting a national campaign.
          The multitude of Unstructured women's liberation groups can choose
          to support or not support the national campaigns, but are incapable
          of mounting their own. Thus their members become the troops under the
          leadership of the Structured organizations. The avowedly Unstructured
          groups have no way of drawing upon the movement's vast resources to
          support its priorities. It doesn't even have a way of deciding what
          they are.<br/>

          more unstructured a movement it, the less control it has over the directions
          in which it develops and the political actions in which it engages.
          This does not mean that its ideas do not spread. Given a certain amount
          of interest by the media and the appropriateness of social conditions,
          the ideas will still be diffused widely. But diffusion of ideas does
          not mean they are implemented; it only means they are talked about.
          Insofar as they can be applied individually they may be acted on; insofar
          as they require coordinated political power to be implemented, they
          will not be.<br/>

          long as the women's liberation movement stays dedicated to a form of
          organization which stresses small, inactive discussion groups among
          friends, the worst problems of Unstructuredness will not be felt. But
          this style of organization has its limits; it is politically inefficacious,
          exclusive, and discriminatory against those women who are not or cannot
          be tied into the friendship networks. Those who do not fit into what
          already exists because of class, race, occupation, education, parental
          or marital status, personality, etc., will inevitably be discouraged
          from trying to participate. Those who do fit in will develop vested
          interests in maintaining things as they are.<br/>
<img align="left" alt="" border="0" height="10" hspace="0" src="https://readwise.io/reader/imgproxy?url=http%3A//www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif&amp;hash=f4d1a8a593cb888c4a6cfa1ba1bdb9cc" vspace="0" width="15"/>The
          informal groups' vested interests will be sustained by the informal
          structures which exist, and the movement will have no way of determining
          who shall exercise power within it. If the movement continues deliberately
          to not select who shall exercise power, it does not thereby abolish
          power. All it does is abdicate the right to demand that those who do
          exercise power and influence be responsible for it. If the movement
          continues to keep power as diffuse as possible because it knows it
          cannot demand responsibility from those who have it, it does prevent
          any group or person from totally dominating. But it simultaneously
          insures that the movement is as ineffective as possible. Some middle
          ground between domination and ineffectiveness can and must be found.<br/>

          problems are coming to a head at this time because the nature of the
          movement is necessarily changing. Consciousness-raising as the main
          function of the women's liberation movement is becoming obsolete. Due
          to the intense press publicity of the last two years and the numerous
          overground books and articles now being circulated, women's liberation
          has become a household word. Its issues are discussed and informal
          rap groups are formed by people who have no explicit connection with
          any movement group. The movement must go on to other tasks. It now
          needs to establish its priorities, articulate its goals, and pursue
          its objectives in a coordinated fashion. To do this it must get organized
      -- locally, regionally, and nationally.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><img align="left" alt="" border="0" height="10" hspace="0" src="https://readwise.io/reader/imgproxy?url=http%3A//www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif&amp;hash=f4d1a8a593cb888c4a6cfa1ba1bdb9cc" vspace="0" width="15"/>Once 
        the movement no longer clings tenaciously to the ideology of "structurelessness," 
        it is free to develop those forms of organization best suited to its healthy 
        functioning. This does not mean that we should go to the other extreme 
        and blindly imitate the traditional forms of organization. But neither 
        should we blindly reject them all. Some of the traditional techniques 
        will prove useful, albeit not perfect; some will give us insights into 
        what we should and should not do to obtain certain ends with minimal costs 
        to the individuals in the movement. Mostly, we will have to experiment 
        with different kinds of structuring and develop a variety of techniques 
        to use for different situations. The Lot System is one such idea which 
        has emerged from the movement. It is not applicable to all situations, 
        but is useful in some. Other ideas for structuring are needed. But before 
        we can proceed to experiment intelligently, we must accept the idea that 
        there is nothing inherently bad about structure itself -- only its excess 
        use.<br/>
