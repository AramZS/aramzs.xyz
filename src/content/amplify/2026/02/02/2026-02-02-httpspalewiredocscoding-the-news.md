title: Coding the News
---
<p>Learn how America's top news organizations escape rigid publishing systems to design beautiful data-driven stories on deadline.</p>
<p>In the first half of the semester, you will learn the software and skills that news developers use to build interactive, data-driven stories.</p>
<p>Each week you will be expected to complete assignments that reinforce the skills covered in class. You will be expected to research how professional newsrooms use these tools and present your findings to classmates.</p>
<p>It's time to build. You will practice your new skills by creating simplified versions of common digital story formats.</p>
<p>Each class begins with a folder of text, images, data and graphics that we will assemble together into a working prototype. After getting familiar with each format, you will be asked to develop and publish a variation on the example.</p>
