<p>When I wrote my first RE:PUBLIC <a href="https://www.republic.land/flooding-the-zone-with-public-lands-journalists/">newsletter back in August</a>, I flagged what I called the administration’s “flood the zone with shit” approach to public lands management—a Steve Bannon‑style strategy of dropping so many new policies, and in such quick succession, that journalists can’t keep up. My point then: if we’re just reacting to the latest headline, we lose the bigger picture. “The desired outcome of such a strategy is the very paralysis I feel today,” I wrote back in August. “The administration wants journalists so disoriented by the pace of change in public-lands management that we don’t know where to start covering it.”</p>
<p>Then I listed the following, by way of example:</p>
<ul><li>The proposal from Utah senator Mike Lee to sell off millions of acres of federal public lands</li><li>The rescinding of the “roadless rule,” which has protected some of our last stands of old growth in our national forests</li><li>The attempted raid on the landmark Land and Water Conservation Fund to pay for deferred federal maintenance in our national parks</li><li>The declawing of the Endangered Species Act</li><li>The dismantling of environmental regulations to roll out the red carpet for the oil and gas industry</li></ul>
<p>Since then, the pace of public-lands policy changes has only accelerated. The list is much longer now, and growing: plans to rescind the Public Lands Rule, the record acceleration of oil-and-gas lease sales, the reviving of the dying coal industry, the use of the Congressional Review Act to undo management plans, the targeting of National Wildlife Refuges for elimination, the loosening of protections to open up lands in Alaska for energy and mining development—and that’s just scratching the surface. It <em>is </em>disorienting.</p>
<p>For this week’s newsletter, I want to look back at some key stories we’ve published, update what’s happened since, and connect the dots. From coal leasing flops and roadless rule rollbacks to “acting” leaders running Interior, these are the developments that matter—and keeping track of them is how we resist the chaos. If we don’t step back and systematically track each of these developments, the “Bannon approach” wins: journalists and the public get paralyzed, confused, and disengaged, while an administration can quietly reshape our public lands.</p>
<figure></figure><h2>Acting the Part</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.republic.land/acting-the-part/"><em>September 26, 2025</em></a></p>
<p>In this column, we explored the widespread use of “acting” appointments in leadership positions at the Department of Interior, a way to skirt Senate questioning, oversight, and controversial confirmation hearings. We highlighted a number of specific cases:</p>
<ul><li>Bill Groffy, Acting Director, Bureau of Land Management</li><li>Jessica Bowron, Comptroller, exercising the delegated authority of the Director of National Park Service</li><li>Kevin Lilly, Acting Assistant Secretary of the Interior, Fish and Wildlife and Parks. </li></ul>
<blockquote>“Senate confirmation is meant to provide scrutiny and legitimacy for people wielding major federal power. Without that process, agencies can appear more politicized and less stable, with shifting leadership and unclear mandates. And in this current climate, with unprecedented threats to public lands, the title trend at Interior should disturb anyone who cares about transparent policymaking.”</blockquote>
<h3>What’s Happened Since </h3>
<p>An over-reliance on acting leaders persists at the Department of Interior and other agencies, though more nomination have recently been put forward for full-time Senate-approved appointments. The most high-profile example remains Jessica Bowron, who has been steering the National Park Service (NPS) since January 20, 2025, officially “exercising the delegated authority of the Director”—a bureaucratic title workaround that keeps her in place now well past the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R44997?ref=republic.land">Federal Vacancy Reform Act</a>’s (FMLA) 210‑day limit for appointees in “acting” roles.</p>
<p>The workaround is also legally questionable, which could leave all of her decision making to date vulnerable to future court challenges. Bowron oversees operations, issues policy guidance, and signs documents just like a confirmed director, even though her title is technically a mouthful of legalese. As of this writing, the administration has still not put forward an official nominee for the position.</p>
<p>Kevin Lilly, meanwhile, continues as Acting Assistant Secretary for Fish, Wildlife, and Parks. At 179 days and counting, he will hit the FVRA legal limit next month. Lilly, whose remit includes oversight of Bowron and the NPS, was considered an odd choice at the time of his appointment, due to his “complete lack of experience in conservation or public-land management,” as I explained back then. Prior to his current appontment, Lilly was a private wealth manager in Texas. No official nominee has been put forward for his role.</p>
<p>Bill Groffy still holds the reins at the Bureau of Land Management; however, former New Mexico congressman Steve Pearce was officially nominated for the role in early November. Technically, now that a nominee has been put forward, Groffy is okay to blow by the 210-day mark.</p>
<h3>The Bigger Picture </h3>
<p>Cabinet‑level roles like Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and Deputy Secretary Katharine MacGregor are Senate‑confirmed, but the layers below are still heavily propped up by acting and delegated officials. Until the White House sends nominations—or the Senate acts—the Interior is running in a hybrid mode, with some leaders skating past FVRA deadlines and putting their policy records in legal jeopardy.</p>
<figure></figure><h2>The Dying Embers</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.republic.land/the-dying-embers/"><em>Oct. 3, 2025</em></a></p>
<p>In <em>The Dying Embers</em>, we warned that the administration’s embrace of coal mining on public lands was fundamentally misaligned with economic trends and the public’s growing appetite for recreation‑based economies.</p>
<h3>What We Said Then</h3>
<blockquote>“Betting on coal as a core economic driver for public lands risks undermining the outdoor recreation economy that actually sustains rural communities and small towns. Coal’s decline is a market reality, not an environmental mandate, yet Interior seems intent on doubling down.”</blockquote>
<p>We argued that expanding coal leases wouldn’t reverse the industry’s long decline and could do real damage to landscapes and local economies that depend far more on recreation and conservation.</p>
<h3>What’s Happened Since </h3>
<p>In late 2025, the Department of the Interior pushed forward with a flurry of coal leasing activity as part of its “American Energy Dominance” agenda, opening new acreage and touting lease sales in Alabama, Utah, and Montana. These included offerings for millions of tons of recoverable federal coal at sites like the Falkirk and Freedom mines in North Dakota, as well as elsewhere.</p>
<p>But the market response has been mixed—<a href="https://www.spglobal.com/market-intelligence/en/news-insights/articles/2025/11/trump-s-push-to-revive-us-coal-faces-weak-market-demand-after-failed-lease-sales-95514398?ref=republic.land">and in some cases </a>embarrassing for the administration. A major Powder River Basin coal lease sale in Montana <a href="https://www.deseret.com/the-west/2025/10/09/coal-lease-sale-one-bid-powder-river-basin-interior-department/?ref=republic.land">drew only one, low-ball bid</a>—a source of boundless schadenfreude for clean-energy proponents. Federal officials rejected the bid because it was far below fair market value, and an additional planned Wyoming sale was postponed shortly afterward. The low bid and subsequent delay underscored broader questions about the viability of federal coal leasing in an era when utilities are burning less coal and switching to cheaper gas and renewables.</p>
<p>The overall picture is one of policy ambition colliding with market reality: federal agencies continue to offer coal leases under executive priorities, but the energy market is not uniformly stepping up to buy or develop that coal at scale.</p>
<h3>What’s Next </h3>
<p>Because some high‑profile western coal lease sales flopped or were deferred, there’s internal debate within DOI and among industry stakeholders about whether to schedule additional sales in places like Wyoming’s Powder River Basin or elsewhere. Interior has been circumspect about setting new dates for major lease auctions while it sorts out pricing issues and industry interest.</p>
<p>With bidders balking at federal coal parcels, Interior has recently doubled down on its strategy. In an apparent effort to <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91480142/the-trump-administration-has-a-new-mascot-a-literal-hunk-of-coal?ref=republic.land">rebrand coal as friendly, cute, and harmless,</a> Secretary Burgum recently unveiled a new Clean Coal cartoon “spokesperson” named—<a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DUHGfkvkR9b/?ref=republic.land">I</a>’<a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DUHGfkvkR9b/?ref=republic.land">m not making this up</a>—“Coalie.”</p>

<figure></figure><h2>Revisiting the Roadless Rule</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.republic.land/revisiting-the-roadless-rule/"><em>Sept. 19, 2025</em></a></p>
<p>The week RE:PUBLIC launched its website, we explored how undoing protections for roughly 58 million acres of inventoried roadless forest could be a misguided move with major huge consequences for critical watersheds and remaining old-growth forests.</p>
<h3>What We Said Then</h3>
<blockquote>“The Roadless Rule is not a relic. It protects water, wildlife, and public access while allowing forests to generate timber sustainably. Repealing it is a hammer blow to both conservation and recreation, and it ignores decades of evidence that these areas can contribute to local economies without being logged into oblivion.”</blockquote>
<h3>What’s Happened Since </h3>
<p>USDA has advanced its push to repeal the Roadless Rule through formal rule-making. After a public comment period that <a href="https://westernpriorities.org/2025/09/comment-analysis-finds-over-99-opposition-to-repealing-2001-roadless-rule/?ref=republic.land">drew overwhelming opposition</a>, regulators began preparing a draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) as part of the repeal process. Hundreds of thousands of comments urged the agency to preserve roadless protections, while conservation groups stepped up coordination around potential legal challenges if USDA moves forward with repeal.</p>
<p>Legislatively, Democrats introduced bills to codify roadless protections into law, while resistance to repeal has also come from some Republican governors, local officials, and former land managers—though not yet from GOP lawmakers in Congress. On Wednesday, four former U.S. Forest Service chiefs, whose tenures spanned both Republican and Democratic administrations, wrote an op-ed in the Washington Post defending the roadless rule, titled: “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/ripple/2026/01/27/roadless-conservation-rule-repeal/?ref=republic.land">Democrat or Republican, Americans want their National Forests kept intact</a>.”</p>
<h3>What’s Next </h3>
<p>USDA is expected to release a draft EIS and proposed rule in early to mid-2026, opening a second phase of public comment and legal scrutiny. Conservation coalitions are advancing both litigation strategies and legislative pressure campaigns to block the repeal, while states and stakeholders weigh their own responses.</p>
<figure></figure><h2>The Great Conservation Vibe Shift</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.republic.land/the-great-conservation-vibe-shift/"><em>Nov. 7, 2025</em></a></p>
<p>In November, we wrote about the nomination of oil-and-gas industry veteran and former New Mexico congressman Steve Pearce to lead the Bureau of Land Management, arguing that it offered an unusually clear window into the administration’s public-lands priorities.</p>
<h3>What We Said Then</h3>
<blockquote>“The post-pandemic love affair with public lands didn’t just boost visitation — it created political momentum for lasting protections. But the current agenda is moving in the opposite direction: accelerating leasing, undermining conservation safeguards, and sending a message that extraction comes first, even as the public grows more invested in preservation.”</blockquote>
<h3>What’s Happened Since </h3>
<p>Since that column ran, Pearce’s nomination has stalled. Nearly three months later, no hearings have been scheduled, which may be due to the fierce resistance to Pearce in countless op-eds that point to an anti-public lands record that earned him the nickname “Sell-off Steve.” Oil and gas lease sales on BLM land have advanced at a rapid clip, but the agency itself remains under acting leadership. The result is a strange disconnect: the agency charged with managing nearly 250 million acres of public land is being reshaped by policy decisions without a Senate-confirmed director in place, while the nominee waiting in the wings embodies the same extractive emphasis driving those decisions.</p>
<p>That limbo has sharpened the stakes. Conservation groups and outdoor industry leaders now treat Pearce’s nomination as a sign of the perceived disconnect between federal policy and how these landscapes are valued on the ground, where the recreation economy is booming. State and local officials in tourism-dependent communities have echoed that concern, warning that short-term extraction gains threaten long-term economic health.</p>
<h3>What’s Next </h3>
<p>Whether or not Pearce ultimately receives a hearing, his nomination has already become a litmus test. If it advances, it will signal an administration doubling down on an extraction-first vision for the BLM. If it stalls indefinitely, it may be a sign that the Senate Stewardship Caucus is successfully pushing back, though it won’t necessarily slow down the agency’s prioritization of energy interests. Either outcome feeds the same underlying question heading toward the 2026 midterms: who are public lands for—and who gets to decide?</p>
<figure></figure><h2>Lock the Gates?</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.republic.land/lock-the-gates/"><em>September 12, 2025</em></a></p>
<p>With a government shutdown appearing to be imminent, we looked at the complicated decision the administration faced with regards access to national parks during the latest budget crisis. I raise this one because another shutdown is looming.</p>
<h3>What We Said Then</h3>
<blockquote>Closing them feels like punishing Americans for endless D.C. dysfunction. But our recent history has taught us a hard truth: leaving parks open without staff is a recipe for destruction, danger, and disrespect. The most responsible policy during a shutdown is also a uniquely unpopular one: close the gates.”</blockquote>
<h3>What’s Happened Since </h3>
<p>The federal government shut down on October 1, and the Department of the Interior issued a contingency plan directing that U.S. national parks remain partially open, even as roughly 9,000 National Park Service employees were furloughed. Roads, trails, and lookouts stayed accessible, while visitor centers, museums, and staffed facilities were largely closed. Many areas were left unsupervised, creating confusion for visitors.</p>
<p>On the ground, the consequences of keeping parks open without full staffing quickly became evident. Historic and natural resources experienced <a href="https://www.fox13now.com/news/local-news/southern-utah/graffiti-vandalism-discovered-inside-arches-national-park-during-government-shutdown?ref=republic.land">instances of vandalism</a> and off-trail damage. Visitors engaged in unauthorized or risky activities—<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2025/10/25/yosemite-climbers-base-jumpers/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">BASE jumping in Yosemite</a>—with limited oversight, and search-and-rescue services were constrained. Although parks technically remained accessible, advocates and former staff warned that the lack of professional oversight during the 43-day shutdown posed heightened risks to both public safety and long-term resource preservation.</p>
<h3>What’s Next </h3>
<p>As I write this, Democrats in the Senate are demanding changes to the administration’s immigration enforcement policies before voting to approve the latest budget appropriation bill, which could result in another government shut down as soon as Saturday the 31st. However, an appropriation bill covering the Interior Department budget through September already passed, so National Parks should not be affected.</p>
<figure></figure><h2><strong>The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly</strong></h2>
<p><em>Every Friday, our team shares critical stories about public lands from around the internet. This list could be exhaustive and exhausting, but our intent is to inform, not overwhelm. Instead, we choose three to five important stories you should be aware of—including at least one piece of good news.</em></p>
<p><strong>The Good: </strong><a href="https://www.uiargonaut.com/2026/01/29/idaho-senator-proposes-constitutional-amendment-to-protect-public-lands/?ref=republic.land">Idaho Senator Proposes Constitutional Amendment to Protect Public Lands</a> “On Wednesday, Jan. 21, Sen. Ben Adams, R-Nampa, proposed an amendment to the Idaho state constitution to prevent new public lands acquisition by the state from being sold. The amendment, which would apply to any new land received by the state from the federal government would ensure the security of those lands from permanent impairment. Adams, having been involved with the legislature since 2020, said to the Senate State Affairs Committee on Wednesday that public opinion helped to shape his proposal, according to the <a href="https://idahocapitalsun.com/2026/01/21/idaho-constitutional-amendment-proposed-by-state-senator-to-protect-public-lands/?ref=republic.land">Idaho Capital Sun</a>. ‘I wanted feedback. I wanted a lot of feedback, because it deals with a very personal matter for every Idahoan, and that is our public land here in Idaho,’ Adams said.”</p>
<p><strong>The Bad: </strong><a href="https://theintercept.com/2026/01/21/nps-national-park-service-employees-cuts/?ref=republic.land">Trump Admin “Deliberately” Tanking Morale to Get Parks Staff to Quit, Official Says in Leaked Tape</a> “A recent National Park Service directive to limit high scores on employee evaluations has raised fears of more layoffs after a turbulent year of cuts and resignations. Staffers at the beloved agency were kept in the dark about why their supervisors were ordered to cap scores. In audio obtained by <em>The Intercept</em>, however, a top regional director said the directives came from top officials in Washington, including the budget office led by Project 2025 architect <a href="https://theintercept.com/2025/01/15/confirmation-hearing-russell-vought-mass-firings/?ref=republic.land">Russell Vought</a>. Don Striker, a veteran agency leader who oversees parks in Alaska such as Denali National Park, said the new performance review process was crafted outside the NPS. “To the extent that they continue to do things that many of us feel are the reign of terror, that deliberately impact our morale in hopes that they’ll drive us out, that’s OMB and that’s OPM, right?’ Striker said, referring to Vought’s Office of Management and Budget and the Office of Personnel Management. ‘And that’s what the performance thing came under.’”</p>
<p><strong>The Ugly:</strong> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2026/01/27/national-parks-signs-censorship/?ref=republic.land">National Park Signs Related to Native Americans, Climate Change to Be Removed</a> “Trump officials have ordered national parks to remove dozens of signs and displays related to climate change, environmental protection and settlers’ mistreatment of Native Americans in a renewed push to implement President Donald Trump’s executive order on ′<a href="https://whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/restoring-truth-and-sanity-to-american-history/?ref=republic.land">restoring truth and sanity to American history</a>.’ Park staff have interpreted Trump’s directive—which seeks to scrub federal institutions of what it calls ‘partisan ideology’ and remove any content deemed to ‘disparage Americans past or living’—to include any references to historic racism and sexism, as well as climate change and LGBTQ+ rights. Last week, that included the removal of an exhibit at Independence National Historical Park that focused on George Washington’s ownership of enslaved people.”</p>
