<p>Successful autocrats know where to draw the line. They can lie, cheat, rig elections, and lock up opponents but there’s still a point where public opinion matters. Over time, as institutions and free media are destroyed, that point shifts, but it’s always there. Even Putin worries about the impact of mass mobilisation and rising food prices.</p>
<p>For the Trump administration, still in the early stages of attempted autocracy, the brutal killing of Alex Pretti crossed the line. Usually supine Republicans <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/ceace997-eb6d-43ac-8a64-7a2c6a19e54b">raised concerns</a>. Claims that Pretti was “brandishing” a weapon and was a “would be assassin” were so obviously contradicted by multiple videos that many of Trump’s online cheerleaders stayed quiet.</p>
<p>There was something of a panicked retreat. The absurdly villainous border patrol commander <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cgrdlr70qg4o">Greg Bovino was removed from Minnesota</a>; the officers involved in the shooting were put on administrative leave; negotiations with state and local officials restarted. As always the retreat is only temporary. The ICE operation continues and people are still being imprisoned and harassed for no legitimate reason. Last Friday four journalists <a href="https://www.npr.org/2026/01/30/nx-s1-5693756/don-lemon-arrest-cnn-minneapolis">covering protests were arrested</a>.</p>
<p>But the initial overreach still caused ructions within the administration. Officials, including Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, <a href="https://newrepublic.com/post/205811/department-homeland-security-stephen-miller-alex-pretti-smear-campaign">sought to blame Stephen Miller for the fiasco</a>. He was the one who tweeted out the “assassin” comment and pushed others to follow. Miller, in turn, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/stephen-miller-kristi-noem-minneapolis-b2909530.html">blamed ICE officers</a> for giving him inaccurate information but, even if they did, there was no need to rush out with a libellous statement.</p>
<p>There was some <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/28/stephen-miller-ice-minneapolis-trump">speculation he might even be fired</a>, after being pointedly left out of a meeting to figure out a response. But he’s far too important to the President for that to happen. Miller is one of very few aides who’s been at Trump’s side every minute of both presidencies, and is now the heart of the whole operation. There’s a reason he’s known as “Trump’s Prime Minister”.</p>
<p>Miller’s ascent encapsulates the difference between Trump’s first and second terms. The first time around he was a senior adviser and speechwriter. He had a lot of influence, particularly over immigration policy, which has always been his obsession. But he wasn’t in charge and often found himself in bureaucratic battles with people like John Kelly, who initially ran Homeland Security before becoming Trump’s chief of staff until January 2019.</p>
<p>This time he has far more authority, partly due to greater formal responsibility, but also because anyone who might have stood up to him has gone. As the Pretti incident makes clear Noem takes direction from him, and his purview extends well beyond immigration. Miller has <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/ice-stephen-miller-pretti-trump-2448e779?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqcTcXpiI4_86YLY-_wlTNzuijk1m8Xo23_lxG0njnJYjEy-s3TLUj3Ed5rsxlg%3D&amp;gaa_ts=69830c7d&amp;gaa_sig=6o6MGpSjxRGFpzAohi6AOYIKOfQERntYbKfbFlANNJpZryTL_uncx8B9dxh1I5KJRufLr8QJg4nv5cgHzsUsRA%3D%3D">personally drafted or edited</a> every executive order Trump has signed in the past year. He leads meetings on everything from economic policy to the use of the military.</p>
<p>In the leaked Signal chat about the bombing of Yemen, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/2026/01/stephen-miller-trump-white-house/685516/">it was Miller who brought the conversation to a close</a> and said the strikes should go ahead. It seems he was also the aide who reactivated Trump’s longstanding interest in occupying Greenland. It was only after Miller’s podcaster wife, Katie, tweeted an image of Greenland covered in the American flag with the single word “soon”, that Trump <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4g0zg974v1o">started talking about it again</a>. Miller was almost certainly <a href="https://emptywheel.net/2025/12/10/michael-anton-and-the-secret-national-security-strategy/">one of the drafters of the National Security Strategy</a>, which spoke of supporting radical right parties in Europe to fight against “civilisational erasure”.</p>
<p>So understanding Miller is essential to making sense of the regime. Not just because of his influence but also because he is the nexus between the key movements and groupings on the right that have come together as Trumpism.</p>
