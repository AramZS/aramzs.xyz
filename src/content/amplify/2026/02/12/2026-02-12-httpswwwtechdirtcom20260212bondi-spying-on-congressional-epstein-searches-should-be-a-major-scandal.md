title: Bondi Spying On Congressional Epstein Searches Should Be A Major Scandal
---
<h3>from the <i>another-day,-another-scandal</i> dept</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Attorney General Pam Bondi appeared before the House Judiciary Committee. Among the more notable exchanges was when Rep. Pramila Jayapal asked some of Jeffrey Epstein’s victims who were in the audience to stand up and indicate whether Bondi’s DOJ had ever contacted them about their experiences. None of them had heard from the Justice Department. Bondi wouldn’t even look at the victims as she frantically flipped through her prepared notes.</p>
<p>And that’s when news organizations, including Reuters, caught something alarming: one of the pages Bondi held up clearly showed searches that Jayapal herself had done of the Epstein files:</p>

<p>The Department of Justice—led by an Attorney General who is supposed to serve the public but has made clear her only role is protecting Donald Trump’s personal interests—is actively surveilling what members of Congress are searching in the Epstein files. And then bringing that surveillance data to a congressional hearing to use as political ammunition.</p>
<p>This should be front-page news. It should be a major scandal. Honestly, it should be impeachable.</p>
<p>There is no legitimate investigative purpose here. No subpoena. Nothing at all. Just the executive branch tracking the oversight activities of the legislative branch, then weaponizing that information for political culture war point-scoring. The DOJ has <strong>no business whatsoever</strong> surveilling what members of Congress—who have oversight authority over the Justice Department—are searching.</p>
<p>Jayapal is rightly furious:</p>

<p>We’ve been here before. Way back in 2014, the CIA <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2014/08/01/cia-spying-senate-went-much-further-than-originally-reported/">illegally spied on searches by Senate staffers</a> who were investigating the CIA’s torture program. It was considered a scandal at the time—because it was one. The executive branch surveilling congressional oversight is a fundamental violation of separation of powers. It’s the kind of thing that, when it happens, should trigger immediate consequences.</p>
<p>And yet.</p>
<p>Just a few days ago, Senator Lindsey Graham—who has been one of the foremost defenders of government surveillance for years—<a href="https://apnews.com/article/jack-smith-investigation-phone-records-6e81f7f967f47673be88695f431eea6f">blew up at a Verizon executive</a> for complying with a subpoena that revealed Graham’s call records (not the contents, just the metadata) from around January 6th, 2021.</p>
<blockquote> <p><em>“If the shoe were on the other foot, it’d be front-page news all over the world that Republicans went after sitting Democratic senators’ phone records,” said Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who was among the Republicans in Congress whose records were accessed by prosecutors as they examined contacts between the president and allies on Capitol Hill.</em></p> <p><em>“I just want to let you know,” he added, “I don’t think I deserve what happened to me.”</em></p> </blockquote>
<p>This is the same Lindsey Graham who, over a decade ago, said he was <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2013/06/10/sen-lindsey-graham-verizon-customer-im-glad-nsa-is-harvesting-my-data-because-terrorists/">“glad”</a> that the NSA was collecting his phone records because it magically kept him safe from terrorists. But now <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2025/11/13/gop-threatened-to-keep-the-government-shut-down-if-8-gop-senators-couldnt-profit-from-being-investigated/">he’s demanding hundreds of thousands of dollars</a> for being “spied” on (he wasn’t—a company complied with a valid subpoena in a legitimate investigation, which is how the legal system is supposed to work).</p>
<p>So here’s the contrast: Graham is demanding money and media attention because a company followed the law. Meanwhile, the Attorney General is <em>actually</em> surveilling a Democratic member of Congress’s oversight activities—with no legal basis whatsoever—and using that surveillance for political theater in a manner clearly designed as a warning shot to congressional reps investigating the Epstein Files. Pam Bondi wants you to know she’s watching you.</p>
<p>Graham claimed that if the shoe were on the other foot, it would be “front-page news all over the world.” Well, Senator, here’s your chance. The shoe is very much on the other foot. It’s worse than what happened to you, because what happened to you was legal and appropriate, and what’s happening to Jayapal is neither.</p>
<p>But we all know Graham won’t speak out against this administration. He’s had nearly a decade to show whether or not the version of Lindsey Graham who said “if we elected Donald Trump, we will get destroyed… and we will deserve it” still exists, and it’s clear that Lindsey Graham is long gone. This one only serves Donald Trump and himself, not the American people.</p>
<p>But this actually matters: if the DOJ can surveil what members of Congress search in oversight files—and then use that surveillance as a weapon in public hearings—congressional oversight of the executive branch is dead. That’s the whole point of separation of powers. The people who are supposed to watch the watchmen can’t do their jobs if the watchmen are surveilling them.</p>
<p>And remember: Bondi didn’t hide this. She brought it to the hearing. She held it up when she knew cameras would catch what was going on. She wanted Jayapal—and every other member of Congress—to see exactly what she’s doing.</p>
<p>This administration doesn’t fear consequences for this kind of vast abuse of power because there haven’t been any. And the longer that remains true, the worse it’s going to get.</p>
