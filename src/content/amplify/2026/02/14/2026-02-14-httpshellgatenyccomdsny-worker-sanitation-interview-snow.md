  A DSNY Worker Answers All Your Burning Questions About the Blizzard (And Yes,
  the Trash)

<p>We get it: There are mountains of gray and yellow snow on every street, and <a href="https://abc7ny.com/post/mamdani-defends-dsny-trash-piles-snowbanks-parts-nyc/18529761/?ref=hellgatenyc.com"><u>the trash is piling up</u></a>. We've heard from <a href="https://abc7ny.com/post/mamdani-defends-dsny-trash-piles-snowbanks-parts-nyc/18529761/?ref=hellgatenyc.com"><u>the mayor</u></a>, from <a href="https://nypost.com/2026/02/02/us-news/nyc-emts-hospitals-plagued-by-massive-piles-of-week-old-snow/?ref=hellgatenyc.com"><u>the right-wing media</u></a>, and from <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/5729521-christie-rips-mamdani-over-garbage-removal-in-new-york-city/?ref=hellgatenyc.com"><u>Chris Christie on Bill Maher</u></a>, but one perspective we rarely get is from the Department of Sanitation workers themselves.</p>
<p>Hell Gate spoke to "Mike," who's worked for DSNY for more than a decade, and whose identity we have independently verified but are withholding because the department forbids workers from giving unsanctioned interviews. "This job is very, very strict when it comes to talking with the public," Mike said.</p>
<p>Because of his seniority, Mike explained that he gets to pick and choose his assignments, and now works collecting trash and recycling on his preferred route in Brooklyn. He's also worked routes in Manhattan, and he's even spent time on the garage floor repairing broken plows like a NASCAR pit crew. We asked Mike how he would rate DSNY's response to the storm this year, why some of the City's streets are still clogged with trash and ice, and what New Yorkers can do to help Sanitation workers clear them.</p>
