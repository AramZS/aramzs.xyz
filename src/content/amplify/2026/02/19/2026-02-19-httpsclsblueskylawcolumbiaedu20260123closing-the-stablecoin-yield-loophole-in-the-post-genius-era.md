<p>The enactment of the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act established the nation’s first federal prudential framework for “payment stablecoins,” mandating 1:1 reserve backing and explicitly prohibiting issuers from paying interest.<a href="applewebdata://9B9D816C-0C67-4111-8E67-38DBF0654516#_edn1">[1]</a> This legislative bargain was clear: Stablecoins would receive a formal regulatory status in exchange for operating solely as neutral payment instruments. However, the statute’s silence on the activities of third-party intermediaries has spawned regulatory arbitrage.<a href="applewebdata://9B9D816C-0C67-4111-8E67-38DBF0654516#_edn2">[2]</a></p>
<p>Digital-asset service providers, particularly major centralized exchanges, now offer “rewards” on stablecoin holdings that are economically indistinguishable from the interest payments Congress sought to prohibit.<a href="applewebdata://9B9D816C-0C67-4111-8E67-38DBF0654516#_edn3">[3]</a> In a new paper, I argue that the yield-restriction provision in the latest draft of the Responsible Financial Innovation Act (RFIA) is not a novel constraint but a necessary correction that closes this unintended loophole in the GENIUS framework.<a href="applewebdata://9B9D816C-0C67-4111-8E67-38DBF0654516#_edn4">[4]</a> By restricting yield to specific “identifiable activities,” the RFIA seeks to restore the original policy bargain and prevent the emergence of an unregulated shadow-banking system.</p>
<h4><strong>The Macroeconomics of Deposit Flight and Credit Contraction</strong></h4>
<p>High-yield stablecoin rewards programs create a powerful incentive for deposit flight, siphoning low-cost retail deposits away from banks. Analysis suggests that if such rewards remain unrestricted, the banking system could face a contraction in lending capacity exceeding $1.5 trillion.<a href="applewebdata://9B9D816C-0C67-4111-8E67-38DBF0654516#_edn5">[5]</a> This risk falls hardest on community banks, which depend on retail deposits to fund relationship-based lending to small businesses and farms.<a href="applewebdata://9B9D816C-0C67-4111-8E67-38DBF0654516#_edn6">[6]</a> Rather than a simple shift in financial intermediation, the migration of these core deposits would represent a net contraction in the credit most vital for local economic growth.</p>
<h4><strong>The “Identifiable Activity” Filter</strong></h4>
<p>The RFIA’s corrective mechanism creates a legal taxonomy to distinguish permissible from prohibited yield. The draft legislation permits rewards only when they are generated by and directly tied to an “identifiable activity” undertaken by the holder, fundamentally banning compensation for the passive holding of a stablecoin asset.<a href="applewebdata://9B9D816C-0C67-4111-8E67-38DBF0654516#_edn7">[7]</a></p>
<ul> <li>Permissible “Transactional Rewards”: The first permissible activity is staking or transaction validation, where a user commits assets to participate in the consensus mechanism of a proof-of-stake blockchain network. The reward is compensation for performing the identifiable, verifiable work of securing the network. The second category is direct liquidity provision, where a user deposits assets into a transparent, on-chain liquidity pool (e.g., an automated market maker on a decentralized exchange) to facilitate peer-to-peer trading. The yield here is generated from identifiable trading fees paid by other network participants.</li> <li>Prohibited “Passive Interest”: Any reward program that generates returns from the opaque reinvestment of user assets by a centralized intermediary falls on the prohibited side of the line. This includes the prevailing model where an exchange, acting as a custodian, aggregates user stablecoins and earns yield through off-chain lending, repurchase agreements, or proprietary trading.<a href="applewebdata://9B9D816C-0C67-4111-8E67-38DBF0654516#_edn8">[8]</a> The user performs no identifiable network service; the user’s return is purely a function of the platform’s investment skill and risk-taking, making the program a deposit substitute in all but name. The distinction is crucial: It seeks to ensure yield is a <em>payment for service</em> within a transparent protocol, not a <em>return on capital</em> managed by an opaque intermediary.</li> </ul>
<p>This legal filter exposes the core of the current arbitrage. As analyzed, platforms like Coinbase market “rewards” for holding USD Coin in custodial wallets.<a href="applewebdata://9B9D816C-0C67-4111-8E67-38DBF0654516#_edn9">[9]</a> Under the Uniform Commercial Code framework adopted in their own user agreements, the exchange, not the end customer, is the legal “holder” of the asset.<a href="applewebdata://9B9D816C-0C67-4111-8E67-38DBF0654516#_edn10">[10]</a> When a stablecoin issuer like Circle shares reserve income with the exchange based on custodial balances, it is effectively paying interest to the holder, a practice that appears to contravene the GENIUS Act’s intent.<a href="applewebdata://9B9D816C-0C67-4111-8E67-38DBF0654516#_edn11">[11]</a> The RFIA’s activity filter would render such arrangements non-compliant, forcing a fundamental restructuring of the stablecoin yield market.</p>
<h4><strong>Financial Stability and the Ethena Case Study</strong></h4>
<p>The October 2025 de-peg of the Ethena (USDe) “synthetic dollar” protocol is a powerful case study.<a href="applewebdata://9B9D816C-0C67-4111-8E67-38DBF0654516#_edn12">[12]</a> USDe’s high yield was generated not from identifiable user activity but from a complex and fragile derivatives strategy (funding “cash and carry” trades). When cryptocurrency volatility spiked and funding costs inverted, the protocol’s economic model broke, triggering a loss of peg and a rapid digital-bank run as users raced to redeem. This event illustrated several critical dangers: the extreme sensitivity of algorithmic yield models to market stress and the potential for contagion as forced liquidations spill over into correlated markets. While USDe was not a GENIUS Act-regulated payment stablecoin, its collapse exemplified the risk the RFIA seeks to preempt: the emergence of high-yield, deposit-like crypto products whose failure could force fire sales of underlying assets (e.g., U.S. Treasuries) and transmit instability to the core financial system, echoing the dynamics of the 2008 money market fund crisis.<a href="applewebdata://9B9D816C-0C67-4111-8E67-38DBF0654516#_edn13">[13]</a></p>
<h4><strong>The Consumer Welfare Paradox</strong></h4>
<p>The RFIA’s firewall presents a consumer welfare trade-off. Proponents argue it establishes a crucial safety floor, preventing the “yield-chasing” behavior that led to catastrophic losses on platforms like Celsius and the Terra/Luna collapse.<a href="applewebdata://9B9D816C-0C67-4111-8E67-38DBF0654516#_edn14">[14]</a></p>
<p>Critics, however, contend the approach is overly paternalistic and protectionist. They argue it deliberately stifles innovation to shield traditional banks from competition, forcing consumers to accept near-zero interest on bank deposits while denying access to alternative returns in a higher interest-rate environment.<a href="applewebdata://9B9D816C-0C67-4111-8E67-38DBF0654516#_edn15">[15]</a> Furthermore, they warn the “activity” requirement may backfire, pushing retail users toward complex, non-custodial DeFi protocols or unregulated offshore entities to seek yield, potentially increasing exposure to technical and smart contract risks. The challenge is to guide innovation toward transparent models, not merely restrict it.</p>
<h4><strong>Toward a Coherent and Level Playing Field</strong></h4>
<p>The yield-restriction provision in the RFIA draft is necessary to close the unintended arbitrage created by the GENIUS Act’s focused scope. For a genuine consumer benefit, this must be part of a broader strategy. The firewall should be coupled with regulatory modernization that allows traditional banks to compete more effectively, perhaps through the development of novel, transparent digital asset services. Ultimately, the goal should be a coherent financial architecture that closes loopholes and allows competition over yield to occur on a level playing field defined by equitable access to financial infrastructure.</p>
