<p>Jamie Siminoff, the founder and chief inventor of Ring, the ubiquitous doorbell camera, was excited for the company’s first Super Bowl television commercial. The 30-second ad presented its product helping with a task as unassailable as apple pie: finding lost dogs.</p>
<p>But since the ad aired, instead of a victory lap, Mr. Siminoff has been on an apology tour.</p>
<p>Or maybe an explanation tour. Whatever you call it, he is responding to a genuine public relations crisis.</p>
<p>The commercial showed a new Ring feature called Search Party, which uses artificial intelligence and images from its cameras to trace a lost pet’s wanderings across a neighborhood. Critics said the feature felt dystopian, showing the potential for far-reaching invasive surveillance. Senator Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts and a critic of corporate data collection, called out “the serious privacy and civil liberties risks” in Ring’s technology.</p>
<p>This week, Mr. Siminoff has made the rounds on TV news shows, trying to allay users’ concerns. He has been on CNN and NBC and talked to The New York Times on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The ad landed at a tense media moment involving home surveillance. In the search for Nancy Guthrie, the missing mother of the TV news anchor Savannah Guthrie, law enforcement agencies were able to recover footage from her Google Nest doorbell, despite reports that she did not have a subscription to the device.</p>
<p>But Ring, which is owned by Amazon, is so ubiquitous that is has become a generic term for any doorbell camera, and users raised questions about how much Ring was monitoring them.</p>
