title: Stop calling optimization "innovation."

<p>"The problem is, if you’re optimizing a product that fundamentally isn’t working for how people get news in 2026, all you’re really doing is riding that buggy off of a cliff with style."</p>
<p>I really appreciate this distillation of the twin needs of optimizing the Engine — getting as much value as you can out of your existing business model — and the Explorer, which is all about actual innovation that seeks out <em>new</em> products, markets, and models.</p>
<blockquote>“If your staff meetings are all about how to hit next month’s KPIs, you don’t have an Explorer. You have a very well-oiled engine. True resilience means insulating your Explorer team from the Engine. It means giving a team room to spend 6 months on a project that could totally flop without punishing them if it does.”</blockquote>
<p>I think this is clearly true. At the same time, I think it’s very optimistic about where many organizations actually are: they very often don’t have those goals or KPIs to hit. The result is a kind of vibes-based strategy. Because nothing is measured, or the right things aren’t measured, it’s impossible to run an informed experiment.</p>
<p>In those organizations, what feels like innovation is just getting to baseline competence. Before they can optimize, they need to define a concrete strategy, with attendant metrics that you can measure as the basis for performing experiments. Buying a neat new product can be a way to absolve the team from doing the hard work of strategy-building: “look,” they can tell their boards, “we’re innovative!”</p>
<p>Creating a concrete strategy and deploying technology that can help serve it are vital. But they, in themselves, aren’t innovation: creating a real culture of innovative experimentation where you can try new things and fail fast is how you de-risk your business for the future. That means understanding your readers incredibly well, so you can anchor your experiments around their needs; it means giving your team the permission to fail; it means creating cross-functional teams who can be radically collaborative and draw conclusions from their experiments quickly; and it means being clear-eyed about where your business actually stands.</p>
