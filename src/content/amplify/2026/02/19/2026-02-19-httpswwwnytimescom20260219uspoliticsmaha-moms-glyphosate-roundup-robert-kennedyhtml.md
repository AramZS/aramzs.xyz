<p>The MAHA Moms have turned on President Trump.</p>
<p>When Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. threw his support behind Mr. Trump’s 2024 campaign for the White House, his corps of health conscious, mostly female, followers embraced the president, who <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EjxNMUCGUY&amp;t=106s">pledged to address</a> Americans’ concerns about “toxins in our environments and pesticides in our food.”</p>
<p>Some of the women, who call themselves the MAHA Moms after Mr. Kennedy’s Make America Healthy Again movement, abandoned the Democratic Party to vote for Mr. Trump.</p>
<p>But the executive order <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/18/us/politics/trump-boost-weedkiller.html">Mr. Trump issued Wednesday</a> to increase domestic production of glyphosate — a widely used weedkiller and possible carcinogen that has been the target of thousands of lawsuits, including one brought by Mr. Kennedy — stunned and infuriated the activists.</p>
<p>It now threatens to turn the brief MAHA-Trump marriage into a divorce.</p>
<p>“Women feel like they were lied to, that MAHA movement is a sham,” said Alex Clark, a health and wellness podcaster for the conservative group Turning Point U.S.A., which is closely allied with the president. “How am I supposed to rally these women to vote red in the midterms? How can we win their trust back? I am unsure if we can.”</p>
<p>Across the country on Thursday, many women who identified with the movement expressed similar feelings of betrayal from the president. But Mr. Kennedy, who issued a statement saying that Mr. Trump’s order would strengthen “our defense readiness and our food supply,” was spared the wrath of the movement’s leaders, if not its rank and file.</p>
<p>“Secretary Kennedy has done everything he said he’s going to do,” said <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/21/dining/food-babe-maha-vani-hari.html">Vani Hari</a>, a healthy eating activist and one-time Democrat (she worked to elect President Barack Obama) who has advised the administration on food policy. “He has upheld his commitment to the American people, Now, whether his boss is doing that is another story.”</p>
