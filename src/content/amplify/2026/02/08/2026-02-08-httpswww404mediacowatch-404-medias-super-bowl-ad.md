<p>Behold, 404 Media’s Super Bowl ad. Yes, we bought a Super Bowl ad. No, we did not spend $8 million.</p>
<p>Until now, 404 Media has never done any paid advertising, but we figured why not get in on the country’s biggest ad extravaganza with a message about our journalist-owned, human-focused media company. There are tons of ads for AI and big tech this year, so how about some counter programming?</p>

<p>On a whim last week, we began looking into purchasing a Super Bowl ad for as little money as possible, by finding a local station willing to air our ad. We knew this was possible because in 2015, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/2/2/7965777/the-verge-super-bowl-ad-helena-montana?ref=404media.co"><u><em>The Verge</em> bought a Super Bowl ad</u></a> that aired only in Helena, Montana, for a cost of $700. Inspired by them, we did the same this year.</p>
<p>After googling “smallest TV markets in the United States,” we came across KYOU, which serves the city of Ottumwa, Iowa: population ~25,000. There were other options, but we thought we would try Ottumwa and see if anyone responded or if this seemed like a fool’s errand. We emailed KYOU to see if we could buy a Super Bowl ad, and we got an immediate answer: There was one slot left, and it would cost $2,550. They also had a slot immediately after the game for $1,250, one during the Olympics following the game for $500, or pregame slots for $500. It felt important to have the ad actually run during the game, so we paid the $2,550 in-game slot.</p>
<p>We then had several things to figure out: First, we needed to make an ad. Second, we needed to find someone in Ottumwa to film the ad for us.</p>

<p>After batting around various concepts involving celebrities that we don’t actually know and high production values that we could neither afford nor execute, we decided to write an incredibly straightforward script about who we are, what we do, and what type of person we are for. We each recorded it in front of our computers where we do our podcasts. It is perhaps the easiest possible concept we could have created, but I think it feels very us. We then asked Evy Kwong, our social media manager, to cut the Super Bowl ad. Evy did a great job with the cybery filters and b-roll. Our friends at <a href="https://www.k-scope.com/?ref=404media.co"><u>Kaleidoscope</u></a>, which produces our podcast, then gave it a last-minute sound mix. We delivered a final version of the ad to KYOU Thursday morning, and were told that it would air early in the third quarter, around 8:07 p.m. CST.</p>

<p>Finding someone in Ottumwa to film the ad for us in its natural habitat was slightly trickier. We put out a call on Bluesky and on our podcast this week, where we very cryptically asked for anyone in Ottumwa to contact us immediately. We got a shocking number of responses from people with ties to Ottumwa, but most either had family or friends there, had lived there briefly and moved on, or lived a few hours away but said they were willing to go there if we needed. Turns out many people were willing to call in favors, even after learning that we were not doing some sort of Flock or ICE investigation and instead needed something more frivolous. We learned a surprising amount of info about Ottumwa during this process, and I made friends with a semi local archaeologist who noted various ancient civilization sites in the broader area. All of this support was a really heartening experience, but we didn’t want to make people drive a long way or reach out to ex-colleagues for us.</p>
<p>Eventually, a current Ottumwan resident said that not only were they going to be in Ottumwa during the Super Bowl, but they would be watching at a party full of people who would also probably be willing to film the TV too. We are endlessly indebted to these folks.</p>
<p>Whether this ad moves the needle for us in any way, only time will tell. If you’re an Ottumwan who saw the ad and checked us out, please let us know.</p>
