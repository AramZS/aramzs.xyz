<p>One night in 2017, I got a Twitter DM from an internet stranger. The message read, "Have you seen this?" and there was a link to a Google document. The document was titled "The Shitty Media Men" list and included names of editors, authors, and publishers.</p>
<p>I clicked the link and opened the document, and immediately saw the name of the man who harassed me in 2015...</p>
