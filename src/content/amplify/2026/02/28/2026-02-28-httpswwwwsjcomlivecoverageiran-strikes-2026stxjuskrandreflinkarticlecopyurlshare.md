<p>Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was confirmed dead following a wave of strikes across the country conducted jointly by the U.S. and Israel. Iran retaliated by firing missiles and drones at Israel and U.S. bases throughout the region. The hostilities threaten to upend energy markets and further shake the power balance in the Mideast.</p>
<p>President Trump called on Iranians to take advantage of the weakened state of Iran’s rulers and pursue regime change, ushering in a period of uncertainty for governments in the Persian Gulf.</p>
<p>In addition to Khamenei, a number of <a href="https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/iran-strikes-2026/card/the-iranian-officials-killed-in-strikes-hyXa00nmIRKk7wga4SBO">top Iranian military and political officials</a> were killed in the attacks.</p>
<p>Trump said the bombing, launched by <a href="https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/iran-strikes-2026/card/how-u-s-military-struck-iran-from-sea-air-Om356OXGodIA2vXuwb3K">sea and air-based platforms</a>, will continue “uninterrupted throughout the week or, as long as necessary.”</p>
