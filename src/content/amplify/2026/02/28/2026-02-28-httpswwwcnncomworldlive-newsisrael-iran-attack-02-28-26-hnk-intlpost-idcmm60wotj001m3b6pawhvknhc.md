<p>• <strong>US and Israel attack Iran:</strong> The US and Israel <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/28/middleeast/israel-attack-iran-intl-hnk">launched strikes</a> on Iran Saturday morning after what the Israeli military said was <a href="https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-attack-02-28-26-hnk-intl?post-id=cmm63vg9100003b6r6xn1ufzo">months of “close and joint planning.”</a> Israel <a href="https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-attack-02-28-26-hnk-intl?post-id=cmm6689f900003b6p6lj4wbzb">said its strikes targeted Iran’s supreme leader</a>, president and head of the armed forces. The US is also planning for several days of attacks, sources tell CNN.</p>
<p>• <strong>Trump calls for regime change:</strong> President Donald Trump described the US military campaign as <a href="https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-attack-02-28-26-hnk-intl?post-id=cmm60gtvr000g3b6r9djjxt4k">“massive and ongoing,”</a> warned American lives <a href="https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-attack-02-28-26-hnk-intl?post-id=cmm60pihp00003b6sojlguzxz">may be lost</a>, and called on Iranians to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-attack-02-28-26-hnk-intl?post-id=cmm60ywtn00073b6skp5oiag2">“take over your government.”</a> He also accused Tehran of working to rebuild its nuclear program after massive US strikes last summer he previously claimed had obliterated the facilities. Iran says its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes.</p>
<p>• <strong>Iran retaliates:</strong> Iran responded to the attacks by launching an unprecedented wave of strikes toward Israel and US targets across the Middle East. Explosions were reported in a number of countries including the UAE, Bahrain and Qatar.</p>
<p>The timing of the US and Israeli attack on Iran bears symbolic meaning in Judaism. Ahead of the upcoming Jewish holiday of Purim, worshippers read the specific portion from the Old Testament, known as Zachor.</p>
<p>The passage from the book of Deuteronomy commands the ancient Israelites to remember an unprovoked attack by the nation of Amalek and to eradicate the memory of Amalek once the Israelites are settled in their land.</p>
<p>The passage is read publicly before Purim to fulfil the mitzvah of remembering Amalek as Israel’s achetypical enemy.</p>
<p>President Donald Trump said in his video that American lives may be lost as a result of his military operation inside Iran.</p>
<p>“The Iranian regime seeks to kill. The lives of courageous American heroes may be lost and we may have casualties — that often happens in war — but we’re doing this not for now. We’re doing this for the future, and it is a noble mission,” the president said.</p>
<p>He he said the US had “taken every possible step to minimize the risk to US personnel in the region.”</p>

<p>President Donald Trump is spending the weekend at his private club in Palm Beach, Florida as the US and Israel have carried out strikes on Iran.</p>
<p>The President traveled to Mar-a-Lago from the Port of Corpus Christi, Texas, where he delivered remarks. He arrived at Mar-a-Lago at 9:01 p.m., according to reporters traveling with the president.</p>
<p>Trump’s public schedule lists him attending a meeting and dinner with MAGA Inc., a super PAC aligned with him, at 7:00 p.m. and 7:30 p.m.</p>
<p>President Donald Trump described the military campaign in Iran as “massive and ongoing,” intended to prevent the country from putting US lives at risk.</p>
<p>“The United States military is undertaking a massive and ongoing operation to prevent this very wicked, radical dictatorship from threatening America and our core national security interests,” he said in <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/116147082884192486">a video message</a>. “We are going to destroy their missiles and raze their missile industry to the ground.”</p>
<p>He said Iran had been working to rebuild its nuclear program after a June US bombing run on its nuclear facilities.</p>
<p>“They rejected every opportunity to renounce their nuclear ambitions, and we can’t take it anymore,” he said.</p>

<p>Explosions were heard in Tehran’s Pasteur district, where the highly secure compound housing the residence and office of Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei is located, Iranian state-affiliated news outlets said.</p>
<p>Fars News Agency said at least 7 missiles struck the area.</p>

<p>President Donald Trump confirmed in a <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/116147082884192486">video posted to social media</a> that the United States had begun a military campaign in Iran.</p>
<p>“Our objective is to defend the American people by eliminating imminent threats from the Iranian regime, a vicious group of very hard, terrible people,” the president said in the video.</p>
<p>“Its menacing activities directly endanger the United States, our troops, our bases overseas and our allies throughout the world,” he said in the eight-minute-long message.</p>
<p>“For 47 years, the Iranian regime has chanted Death to America and waged an unending campaign of bloodshed and mass murder, targeting the United States, our troops and the innocent people in many, many countries,” he said.</p>

<p>Iran is preparing to retaliate following the joint strikes conducted by Israel and the United States on Saturday, according to state-affiliated media.</p>
<p>“Iran is preparing for revenge and a crushing response to the Zionist regime,” said Tasnim, a semi-official news agency linked to Iran’s elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).</p>
<p>Analysts say Tehran possesses a wide range of options for retaliation, including short-range missile strikes on US bases in the region, or on a range of military and civilian sites in Israel. Iranian missiles could also targets US warships.</p>
<p>Besides missiles, Iran maintains smaller naval boats, drones and submarines that could present a threat to US ships in waters in and around the Persian Gulf.</p>
<p>US President Donald <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/19/politics/us-iran-strike-options-trump-military">Trump had been sending mixed signals</a> about whether he planned to attack Iran, preparing for war while saying he favors dialogue.</p>
<p>The United States has moved military assets closer to the Middle East over the past few weeks, raising concerns that the prospects of war were growing.</p>
<p>Trump said on January 22 that the US had “an armada” moving toward Iran “just in case,” adding that while he would rather not “see anything happen,” the US is watching Iran “very closely.” Just hours earlier, that same day, he said that Iran wants to negotiate and that the US is willing to do so.</p>
<p>“Iran does want to talk, and we’ll talk,” Trump said at a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, without offering any more detail.</p>
<p>Trump’s stated reason for attacking Iran was to stop the regime from killing protesters. Since the protests began in late December, he has repeatedly warned that the US would hit Iran if the government used lethal force against civilians.</p>
<p>The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) says at least 5,520 protesters have been killed since the anti-government demonstrations began. Iranian authorities put the death toll at 3,117, including those identified as “civilians,” security forces and “terrorists.” CNN can’t independently verify the number of deaths.</p>
<p>Protests have since waned in Iran, subdued by security forces in the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/26/middleeast/iran-protesters-crackdown-pressure-intl">deadliest crackdown ever</a> by the Islamic Republic.</p>

<p>A 35-year-old Tehran resident told CNN she was in her office when she and her colleagues saw “different places being hit” as well as planes in the sky.</p>
<p>“There was a lot of noise and explosions, and (it was) so terrifying. Everyone freaked out and started leaving,” she said.</p>
<p>“The situation is really bad, they’ve hit a few places and we saw that, but now we have to wait and see.”</p>
<p>Several of Israel’s largest hospitals have announced they are shifting to underground operations as the country’s Health Ministry orders the highest readiness level at medical facilities.</p>
<p>“The Ministry of Health has instructed hospitals to discharge patients who do not require hospitalization,” the ministry said in a statement as it ordered hospitals to move to underground facilities.</p>
<p>Tel Aviv’s Sourasky Medical Center has opened its underground emergency hospital, the hospital said in a statement, and has begun moving patients and departments to the hardened facility.</p>
<p>“Sensitive units have already begun operating in protected spaces,” the hospital said.</p>
<p>Sheba Medical Center in Ramat Gan is preparing to relocate its departments to its underground facilties, the hospital said.</p>
<p>Rambam hospital in Haifa said in a statement that it is clearing its underground parking facilities to prepare for “an emergency state.”</p>
<p>“The public is requested not to arrive except in urgent and emergency medical situations,” the hospital said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Magen David Adom, Israel’s emergency response service, said it is in full coordination with Home Front Command, the Israeli military, and the Ministry of Health as they move from routine operations to emergency operations.</p>
<p>A US official says the US strikes are currently focused on military targets, but declined to elaborate citing an ongoing operation.</p>
<p>Another US official said the goal of the strikes is to address the Iranian military threat and protect US forces. The US put in place measures to protect US military personnel in the region ahead of the action, the first official said.</p>

<p>US Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee encouraged US citizens in Israel to be ready to take “immediate action” should alerts or sirens sound in the country.</p>
<p>“We are encouraging all Embassy team &amp; families &amp; US citizens in Israel to be prepared for Home Front Command alerts &amp; sirens. Stay near shelters &amp; take immediate action at the sound of alerts or sirens,” Ambassador Huckabee <a href="https://x.com/GovMikeHuckabee/status/2027639486293676326?s=20">wrote on X</a>.</p>

<p>The US is carrying out strikes on Iran, three US officials tell CNN. One official said the strikes are in progress, describing them as “not a small strike.”</p>
<p>The last time the United States struck Iranian soil was June 2025 when President Donald Trump ordered warplanes to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/21/politics/trump-iran-air-strikes">drop massive bombs on three nuclear sites</a> inside Iran.</p>
<p>With that strike, he became the first American president to authorize an attack on Iran after nearly half a century of animosity with the Islamic Republic.</p>
<p><em>Watch this to recap what happened in June last year:</em></p>

<p>In retaliation, Iran fired about a dozen short- and medium-range ballistic missiles at the al-Udeid Air Base in Qatar, the largest US military installation in the Middle East.</p>
<p>Soon afterward, the US president announced a ceasefire and warned Israel against dropping more bombs on Iran.</p>

<p>Strikes have been reported in the Iranian cities of Isfahan, Qom, Lorestan, Karaj, Kermanshah and Tabriz as well as the capital Tehran, according to the state-run news agencies Fars and IRNA.</p>
<p>Video shows smoke rising over the Iranian capital.</p>

<p>Israel’s strike on Iran on Saturday morning was coordinated with the United States, an Israeli source told CNN.</p>
<p>It’s unclear at this early stage if it was a unilateral Israeli strike or if the US also took part in the attack.</p>
<p>The Israeli strike targeted ballistic missiles and missile launchers, which Israel has viewed as a serious threat.</p>

<p>Israel’s Home Front Command ordered the public to carry out essential activities only across the country following its strikes on Iran.</p>
<p>The newly announced restrictions prohibit public gatherings, going to work, and going to school.</p>
<p>An exception is made for what Israel calls “exceptional sectors.”</p>
<p>Israel closed its airspace on Saturday morning, the Transportation Ministry said, after the country carried out strikes on Iran.</p>

<p>Israel launched what it called a “preemptive strike” against Iran Saturday morning, according to Defense Minister Israel Katz, as a state of emergency was declared across the country.</p>
<p>The government declared the state of emergency because of the expectation of Iranian retaliation with drones and ballistic missiles.</p>
