It will be yours to take. This will be probably your only chance for generations.”</p><p>The military campaign could prove momentous for Trump, risking a drawn-out regional war that leads to a surge in energy prices and American casualties ahead of mid-term elections later this year. Iran quickly responded by firing missiles on Israel and US bases around the region, and countries in the Persian Gulf <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-28/israel-iran-close-airspace-for-flights-after-strike-on-tehran">closed their airspace</a>.  </p><p>Israel’s military said the campaign would target “dozens of military targets,” and Iran reported strikes on defensive and civilian sites. Several large explosions were reported in the capital, Tehran. </p><p>Iran’s state media said Tehran launched a wave of missile and drone attacks at Israel, while the semi-official Tasnim <a href="">said all</a> US bases and interests in the region would be targeted, including in the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Kuwait. <a href="">Bahrain said</a> an American base in that country had come under attack, and Qatar and the UAE said they intercepted attacks on their territory. Explosions were heard in Dubai.</p><p class="rw-outer-content"><span>Some content could not be imported from the original document.</span> <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-28/israel-launches-attack-on-iran-as-explosions-reported-in-tehran">View content ↗ </a></p><p>Trump said the military operation began after Iran refused to renounce nuclear weapons, which Tehran has repeatedly said it isn’t pursuing. He’s expected to address the nation about Iran later Saturday, the Wall Street Journal reported.</p><p>The US will destroy the Islamic Republic’s missile inventory and industry as well as its navy, the president said. The Associated Press said at least one strike took place near the office of Iran’s supreme leader, <a href="">Ali Khamenei</a>.</p><p>“A short time ago, the US military began major combat operations in Iran. Our objective is to defend the American people by eliminating imminent threats from the Iranian regime,” Trump said, warning that the military operation might cost US lives.</p><p>“My administration has taken every possible step to minimize the risk to US personnel in the region,” Trump said in the video. “Even so, and I do not make this statement lightly, the Iranian regime seeks to kill. The lives of courageous American heroes may be lost and we may have casualties. That often happens in war, but we’re doing this not for now, we’re doing this for the future and it is a noble mission.”</p><p>The operation is expected to continue for several days, Reuters said, citing a US official it didn’t identify.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iVGwpfwbh8BM/v3/pidjEfPlU1QWZop3vfGKsrX.ke8XuWirGYh1PKgEw44kE/-1x-1.png"/></figure><p>The attacks came two days after delegations from Iran and the US met in Switzerland for a third round of negotiations on the Islamic Republic’s nuclear activities. </p><p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-28/us-strikes-iran-what-we-know-about-tehran-s-atomic-capabilities">What We Know About Iran’s Nuclear Program: QuickTake</a></p><p>Oman’s Foreign Minister Badr Albusaidi told CBS television on Friday night there was a “breakthrough” in the negotiations, citing Iran’s agreement not to stockpile highly enriched uranium.
