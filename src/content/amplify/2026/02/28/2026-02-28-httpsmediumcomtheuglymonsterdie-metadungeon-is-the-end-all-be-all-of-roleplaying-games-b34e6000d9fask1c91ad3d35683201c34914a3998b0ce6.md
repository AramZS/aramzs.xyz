<p>I am obsessed with the idea of meta things — movies about movies, comic books about comic books, etc. Before <em>DIE</em>, a few games have satirized or commented on the tabletop roleplaying game space. <em>Dream Park</em> was based on a series of novels about an augmented reality live-action roleplaying game park. <em>HoL: Human Occupied Landfill</em> parodied everything wrong with the super-edgy 90s gaming scene. <em>Violence</em> re-imagined dungeon crawling as home invasions. <em>The True OSR</em> lambasts the nostalgia around “classic” 70s and 80s roleplaying games.</p>
<p><em>DIE </em>is the meta-TTRPG in its final form, but it will soon become more meta than you can possibly imagine.</p>
<blockquote><p data-selectable-paragraph="">“Fifty years of roleplaying games.</p><p data-selectable-paragraph="">One impossibly massive basement.</p><p data-selectable-paragraph="">Even infinity doesn’t have enough room to hold it all.</p><p data-selectable-paragraph="">The DIE Metadungeon is intruding upon our reality.”</p><p data-selectable-paragraph="">— from the DIE: Metadungeon Backerkit page</p></blockquote>
<p>Sweet Jesus. These insane games have existed for at least half a century. <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> celebrated its 50th anniversary two years ago, and some claim it wasn’t actually the first TTRPG. Still, roughly fifty years is close enough.</p>
<p><a data-discover="true" href="https://medium.com/theuglymonster/die-eclipses-dungeons-dragons-in-every-way-that-matters-48e3f245c06a?sk=b319dab4e54237de48b9fb4f2aea7f3e"><em>DIE </em>is an homage to every roleplaying game ever</a>. It includes realms based on Prussian wargames, Charlotte Brontë’s childhood worldbuilding game, and every generic fantasy setting ever. It is comprehensive in the meta sense. It can include any and every TTRPG setting ever devised. Taken to its logical conclusion, it is the Tommy Westphall Universe of tabletop roleplaying games.</p>
<p>Ever since <em>DIE </em>clawed its way into my life, I’ve resisted letting it become my entire personality. When this <em>Metadungeon </em>gets into my filthy hands and brain, it just might consume me.</p>

<blockquote><p data-selectable-paragraph="">“What is DIE the RPG?</p><p data-selectable-paragraph="">Based on the comic of the same name and created by the original writer and artist, DIE the RPG is an award-winning experiment in just how metatextual we can get. It’s an exploration into how much the events of the 1980’s Dungeons &amp; Dragons cartoon would mentally and emotionally scar the kids who got sucked into their own campaign. It’s goth Jumanji. It’s postmodern Gygaxian Isekai. It’s roleplaying games squared.</p><p data-selectable-paragraph="">Players create a Persona — an ordinary real-world gamer who’s bored of their job, regrets not going back to uni to get that MA, wishes they’d not had kids so early, and so on — and that Persona makes a Paragon, a two-dimensional author-insert super-powered fantasy hero in the vein of your average Dungeons &amp; Dragons character to play DIE, a mysterious roleplaying game.</p><p data-selectable-paragraph="">Then (wouldn’t you know it) upon meeting up to play this mysterious roleplaying game, everyone is transported into a bespoke otherworld and becomes their mighty Paragons. The choice as to whether to fight their way back to the real world or stay in a pretend universe is theirs — and dead players don’t get a vote.”</p></blockquote>
<p>What the above excerpt leaves out is that the choice to stay in fantasy land or go home has to be unanimous. And it’s permanent. AND if the group doesn’t come to a consensus in time, the universe falls apart and they all die.</p>
<p>I hadn’t bought single comic issues in decades, but I drive to the comic shop once a month for the newest edition of <em>DIE Loaded</em>, the sequel series to Kieron Gillen’s emotionally sadistic masterpiece. I would have thought the first story would have taken the TTRPG space by storm, but that didn’t happen. Maybe hardcore gamers aren’t ready to explore the ugly reasons they fixate on these games, and I can’t blame them. Knowing thyself is horrible.</p>
<blockquote><p data-selectable-paragraph="">“What is a Metadungeon?</p><p data-selectable-paragraph="">It’s like a megadungeon — but more so. Megadungeons are… really massive dungeons. Multiple floors. Entire ecologies and societies. A whole campaign’s worth of material. Exploration, interconnection, and <em>secrets</em>.</p><p data-selectable-paragraph="">A metadungeon’s like that, but as well as exploring a multi-level dungeon, you’re adventuring through fifty years of TTRPG history, from its birth to its glorious present.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Megadungeons are more of a fantasy thing, so I don’t mess with them often. They also sound exceedingly boring. But a <strong>METAdungeon</strong> — a dungeon about the history of roleplaying games — is definitely my brand.</p>
<p>But do I REALLY want this? <em>DIE</em> is brutal as it is. Can I — and the rest of the roleplaying game community — handle this interrogation of gaming itself?</p>
<blockquote><p data-selectable-paragraph="">“Reminisce about the games and movements of decades past — or discover the trends you missed. Meet your heroes (some of them), debate which is the best version of goblins, and join us in puzzling out what really makes gaming <em>here and now</em>, in the 2020s, unique.</p><p data-selectable-paragraph="">And try not to get killed while you’re doing it.”</p></blockquote>
<p>“Reminisce” isn’t the word I’d use for this trip down memory lane. This scene is unhinged. Between edition wars, culture wars, debates over immersion, and a ton of insufferable “how to be a DM” videos, it’s no wonder normal people want nothing to do with this hobby. One does not “reminisce” about TTRPG history. One frantically pounds Jack &amp; Cokes to drown out the cringe flashbacks.</p>
<p>As for “heroes”, I don’t have any. Mark Rein-Hagan, Mike Pondsmith, and Ray Winninger ruined my life. Two of them cursed me with visions of dark futures that eventually became the present, minus the cool tech, and all three of them infected me and every other gamer I know with excruciating political cynicism.</p>
<p>There have been a few books exploring the entirety of roleplaying games. <em>Designers &amp; Dragons</em>, <em>Gamemasters</em>, and <em>Monsters, Aliens, and Holes in the Ground</em> all did this to various extents, with varying degrees of success, but these tomes don’t get discussed much. This community tends to rely on old forums and hazy memories.</p>
<p><em>Metadungeon </em>might rattle a lot of cages in the TTRPG scene, mainly by flying in the face of what a lot of TTRPGtubers remember — or assume — about past games and conventions and discourse and whatnot. Discussing goblins is like walking through a minefield these days, mainly because of potentially racist connotations. Similar drama over liches, orcs, and a few other fantasy races boils over every few months.</p>
<p>As for what makes modern gaming unique, it could be a lot of things. Safety tools. Cozy fantasy. No character death without player consent. Games that count down to the end of the world. Explicitly political games. Artpunk.</p>

<blockquote><p data-selectable-paragraph="">“DIE shines when it blurs the lines between the fantastic and the mundane, so we’re keen to lean into that for the metadungeon and adapt the core DIE experience to fit. Usually, your game world is made up of thinly-veiled allegories for your characters’ real-world worries — here, we’re approaching that from the other side.”</p></blockquote>
<p>As meta as it is, <em>DIE </em>isn’t <strong>only </strong>about roleplaying games — the TTRPG elements are mostly framing devices for a variety of traumas and regrets and unresolved issues. Now, <em>Metadungeon </em>will make <em>DIE</em> <strong>LITERALLY </strong>a roleplaying game ABOUT roleplaying games. It was already the most meta TTRPG that ever meta’d or TTRPG’d. With the arrival of the <em>Metadungeon</em>, it will unquestionably become the end-all, be-all of tabletop roleplaying games.</p>
<p><em>DIE:RPG</em> is a fairly introspective game, so I can see how it didn’t interest old school gamers — assuming they even heard about it. But an adventure that celebrates all of TTRPGdom might change that. Even OSR (Old School Renaissance) players will be tempted to give it a whirl. This might make <em>DIE</em> <strong>THE</strong> game. And that might lead to the TTRPG scene understanding itself a whole lot better than it does now.</p>
<p>But like I said before, knowing thyself is horrible.</p>
<blockquote><p data-selectable-paragraph="">“Each era of gaming that you’ve lived through (or badmouthed on a now-defunct forum, or lovingly pined over missing out on) has shaped you and made you who you are today — in this dungeon, at least. And the dungeon is all that matters.</p><p data-selectable-paragraph="">Ready to face that nostalgia head-on? Want to fight a quite literal edition war, with edition trebuchets and edition supply lines? Eager to find out what you were missing back when roleplaying games were <em>good?”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>That last bit isn’t a dig on modern TTRPGs. It’s a dig at dudes who think <em>AD&amp;D</em> was the pinnacle of game design and everything that came after it is <strong>dumb</strong> because OH MY GOD this hobby is full of people who CANNOT let go of the past.</p>
<blockquote><p data-selectable-paragraph="">“Unlike regular DIE, because this is a massive adventure, there’ll be mechanics for leaving the otherworld and returning to your grinding real-life existence — before being drawn, inexorably, back to the dungeon.”</p></blockquote>
<p>This set-up is very different from “traditional” <em>DIE</em>. It’s an excellent chance to comment on the very things that kill game campaigns: scheduling conflicts and real-world commitments.</p>
<blockquote><p data-selectable-paragraph="">“And, if Kieron will let us, we’ll put in a new deities, or new Masters (because we all know GMs are as gods to their players… right?) for each realm of gaming: an Old-Testament 1970’s overlord who frowns on players touching their own dice. A many-faced Janus of the 1980’s licensed game explosion. A brooding grim reaper tryhard of the 90’s. A turn-of-the-millenium Hephaestus, guardian of the Forge, set against the lumbering leviathan of the OGL.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Licensed games are a point of contention for the industry. Without <em>Star Trek</em> and <em>Avatar </em>and <em>Conan</em>, some publishers would never survive. Licensed games also introduce those fans to the hobby. That said, games based on entertainment IP crowd out games with original settings. If there were fewer games based on existing stories, would more games with original settings be on Barnes &amp; Noble’s shelves?</p>
<p>The 90s realm will be unbearably cringe. 90s games like <em>Vampire: The Masquerade</em>, <em>Kult, Underground</em>, and <em>Unknown Armies</em> were the apex of “alternative” edginess, and their fans were intolerably angstier-than-thou. That level will probably be filled with more tragic monsters than you can shake a cross at.</p>
<p>But what really excites me is that they name-checked the bane of grognards. The Forge hosted some of the most cutting-edge thinking on tabletop roleplaying design philosophy. And throughout its existence, ludic cavemen whined about it.</p>
<p>An entire vocabulary was built during the aughts that gave verbiage to complex ideas. The cavemen rejected it all. Hence, talking about roleplaying games is a pain in the ass because some dudes didn’t like GNS theory. They’re like those flat-earthers who invent their own scientific models from scratch because they know nothing about actual science, then try to goad actual scientists into commenting on their nonsense, which legitimizes said nonsense. Eventually the owner of The Forge closed the site and moved on.</p>
<p>Of course, no journey through TTRPG history would be complete without interrogating the very thing that kept <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> from dying. Thanks to a combination of misplaced nostalgia and the Open Game License, zillions of fanboys were conned into making material for a corporate IP. Now, <em>D&amp;D</em> is the only roleplaying game the world at large can name. That’s a travesty because it stunts the growth of the entire hobby.</p>
<blockquote><p data-selectable-paragraph="">“Written by Gareth Ryder-Hanrahan — one of the best scenario authors in the business (he wouldn’t let us say he was THE BEST) — it’s part history field trip, part punishing gauntlet, part nightmare hellscape made of your own desires and part lovingly-created Saw trap intended to teach you once and for all what THAC0 means.”</p></blockquote>
<p>I am not at all acquainted with Gareth Hanrahan’s work, not even <em>Dagger in the Heart</em>. Thinking about <em>Heart </em>just makes me want to play its sister game, <em>Spire</em>. Still, he has an impressive resume, so I’m not at all concerned with the quality.</p>
<p>The keywords are telling. “Punishing gauntlet”. “Nightmare hellscape”. “THAC0” (to hit armor class zero). This sounds like a mashup of <em>Tomb of Horrors</em>, <em>Dungeon of the Mad Mage</em>, <em>Designers &amp; Dragons</em>, and <em>Mazes &amp; Monsters</em>.</p>

<blockquote><p data-selectable-paragraph="">“Kieron Gillen (<em>DIE </em>— the comic and the RPG, <em>The Power Fantasy</em>, <em>The Wicked + The Divine</em>, and, again, many many more games and comics) is closely involved in the creative process, from building and refining the core idea to contributing words to the book.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The bond between comic books and roleplaying games is strong. Often, you buy them both at the same store. <em>Marvel Super Heroes</em> and <em>DC Heroes</em> were two of the earliest licensed games and two of the most cherished roleplaying games from the 80s, and <a data-discover="true" href="https://medium.com/theuglymonster/die-maps-the-madness-of-roleplaying-games-9c4f90f7836a?sk=a062773773d340b0a9f5ff1b67ef0817">the story of <em>DIE </em>could only have been told as a comic book</a>. These two hobbies will always be connected at the hip.</p>
<blockquote><p data-selectable-paragraph="">“…Grant Howitt (<em>Spire</em>, <em>Heart</em>, <em>DIE: The RPG</em>, <em>Eat the Reich</em>, <em>Hollows</em>… the list goes on) retains his role as creative provocateur, pushing everything in the Metadungeon up to 11.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Howitt is notorious for making nothing but explicitly anti-trad games. <em>Spire </em>is anti-colonial <em>D&amp;D</em>. <em>Eat the Reich</em> is Inglorious Basterds with vampires. The upcoming <em>Hollows </em>is board-gamey <em>4e</em> and your weapons hate you.</p>
<p>I imagine that the final level of the Metadungeon will harp on the absurdity of modern TTRPG discourse. Player-character death is the drama of the day. OSRians think characters should die more often. Others reject the idea of PCs dying unless the player wants them to for dramatic reasons.</p>
<p>And that’s just the tip of a ludicrous iceberg. The discourse is endless. System doesn’t matter. If you hack or reskin a game, you’re not playing right. <em>D&amp;D</em> can be reskinned to run any genre. Murder hobos are bad. <em>Vampire: The Masquerade</em> should have stayed dead. Video gamers ruined <em>Cyberpunk</em>. Theater of the mind is superior to maps and minis. <em>Pathfinder </em>is just a <em>D&amp;D</em> <em>knockoff</em>. You can’t properly review a game when you’ve only read the rules but haven’t played it. Safety tools are classist. The OGL scandal was fake news. Fantasy TTRPGs should never be “cozy”. Braunstein-style play was a giant troll on the entire scene. “Authentic” medieval fantasy is pointless and dumb. Fantasy is pro-monarchy and thus bad. “Heistfunding” is not a thing. Virtual tabletops are a godsend. Artpunk games aren’t actually games. <a data-discover="true" href="https://medium.com/theuglymonster/eat-the-reich-nazis-are-bad-7b0ef78bbfa9?sk=374372d0e419d73a6bc334b1a37bcef2"><em>Eat the Reich</em></a> is the ideal convention game. Modern <em>Vampire</em>, <em>D&amp;D</em>, and <em>Shadowrun </em>are too woke. You shouldn’t play a non-human. Matt Mercer ruined the hobby. GMs who use ChatGPT are traitors to humanity. Kelsey Dionne should lead the design of <em>6e</em>. <em>Exalted </em>is the pre-history of the <em>World of Darkness</em>. Just because <em>D&amp;D</em> won doesn’t mean it’s good. <em>Lancer</em> is too alien and weird to be taken seriously. Combat wheelchairs are dumb, even in <em>Eberron</em>. We should call <em>D&amp;D 2024</em> “6e”. Orcs are evil and it’s OK to genocide them without remorse. “Heistfunding” is totally a thing. The best thing about <em>3e</em> was the arquebus. The Ennie Awards don’t matter. <a data-discover="true" href="https://medium.com/theuglymonster/d-d-x-stranger-things-hellfire-club-will-mutate-ttrpgs-02cdf26d60ad?sk=f4208126af10f854e9e04e03f9df1c5e">TTRPGs are just weird board games</a>. Ray Winninger should make a <em>Powered by the Apocalypse</em> edition of <em>Underground</em>. Don’t game with nazis. Why are journal gamers like that? What the Hell happened to Cortex? What the Hell happened to the <em>Blades in the Dark</em> TV show? Corkboards &amp; Curiosities should cover <em>Unknown Armies</em>. You should only play <em>Rifts</em> ironically. <em>Daggerheart</em> is overrated. <em>FIST</em> is not PbtA.</p>
<p><em>Metadungeon </em>will probably be <em>DIE’s</em> most successful supplement yet, and that may lead to more designers making compatible material for it. But what if “everyone” gets a taste of <em>DIE: Metadungeon</em>? What if trad gamers want to relive the glory days AND storygamers want to explore this hobby’s ludicrous history AND OSRians hate-read it AND the overthinkers on YouTube produce a bunch of video essays on it? What if it all hits at the same time?</p>
<p>If everything lines up, <em>Metadungeon </em>could supercharge TTRPG discourse and shake the pillars of the hobby. Anti-woke culture warriors will hurl accusations of rewriting history with all the force a grifter can muster. Critical Role fans will go into shock when they discover <em>Mazes</em>, like escapees from Plato’s cave. Covid-era <em>5e</em> kids will devour everything they can learn about Ron Edwards. Barnes &amp; Noble will stock <em>Invisible Sun</em>. Joe Manganiello will run a <em>Marvel Multiverse</em> actual play on Disney+.</p>
<p>Moreover, <em>DIE </em>might breach containment and wind up being some normies’ very first roleplaying game. That’s like <em>Mulholland Drive</em> being the first movie you ever saw, or <a data-discover="true" href="https://medium.com/theuglymonster/planetary-a-kaleidoscope-of-genres-in-one-package-7d0cd0c7a905?sk=e0590629ef5513a7842a6bb00f0b0b04"><em>Planetary</em></a> being the first comic book you ever read.</p>
<p>Obviously, <em>DIE: Metadungeon</em> is unlikely to incite all that, but even a fraction of that would be a seismic shift in the tabletop roleplaying game space. And it is long overdue for a seismic shift.</p>
<p>Tabletop roleplaying games run on epic creativity and soul-crushing obsession. These rituals of dice and books and character sheets and crazy people are either the best or worst thing that ever happened to humanity; this scene needs to know itself WAY better than it does now to determine which, even if the process is horrible.</p>
<p>And if this discourse-on-steroids triggers an apocalypse in the TTRPG scene, so be it.</p>
