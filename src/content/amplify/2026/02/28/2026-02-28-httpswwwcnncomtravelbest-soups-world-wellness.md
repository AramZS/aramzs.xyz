<p>If a steaming bowl of soup strikes you as the ultimate in old-fashioned comfort, you’ve got plenty of company.</p>
<p>Soup is one of the world’s oldest and most universal <a href="https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/world-best-food-dishes/index.html">foods</a>, said Janet Clarkson, author of the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Soup-Global-History-Janet-Clarkson/dp/186189774X">“Soup: A Global History.”</a></p>
<p>“Every culture has some kind of soup,” she said. “It’s got very ancient roots.” Early people simmered it in everything from turtle shells to lengths of bamboo, she writes in the book, turning out metal soup pots starting in the Bronze Age.</p>
<p>Boiling food made it possible to subsist on stable grains, with herbs and other ingredients added for nourishment or medicinal purposes.</p>
<p>Each time you deliver a pot of <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/27/health/hearty-soups-comfort-food-leftovers-wellness/index.html">hearty soup</a> (with perhaps a side of <a href="https://www.cnn.com/travel/best-breads-world">bread</a>) to a friend with the sniffles, Clarkson said you’re in fact carrying on an age-old tradition. “Separating food and medicine — that’s not how ancient people thought of it,” she said. “I think in every country in the world, historically, some soups were seen as restorative.”</p>
<p>That’s true no matter what you call it. Today, soup leans brothy while <a href="https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/birria-stew-eva-longoria-recipe-wellness-origseriesfilms/index.html">stews</a> are more substantial, but the world’s spoonable foods have never fit neatly into the two English-language categories.</p>
<p>While Clarkson dove into centuries of etymology to trace the history of soup, potage and broth, she settled on a generously broad take. “Just some stuff cooked in water,” she wrote, “with the flavored water becoming a crucial part of the dish.”</p>
<p>It’s a definition that leaves room for the world’s tremendous culinary diversity. These are CNN Travel’s nominations for 20 of the best soups around the world:</p>
<figure><picture><figure><img alt="Banga is so popular in Nigeria that shops sell ready-mixed packets of spice." src="https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/210219171603-14-world-best-soups.jpg?c=original&amp;q=w_1093,c_fill"/><figcaption>Banga is so popular in Nigeria that shops sell ready-mixed packets of spice. Shutterstock</figcaption></figure></picture></figure>
<p>Fruits from the oil palm tree lend both fat and flavor to <a href="https://cheflolaskitchen.com/banga-soup/">this soup from the Niger Delta</a>, which also features fresh catfish, beef and dried seafood.</p>
<p>It’s so popular that packets of ready-mixed <a href="https://www.osiafrik.com/products/banga-spice">banga spice</a> are sold in shops. Most blends include African nutmeg, castor seed, orima, jansa and beletete leaves.</p>
<p>The spices infuse a rich, red sauce that’s the soup’s main draw: Soak it up with eba or a ball of starch, two Nigerian staples both made from cassava prepared with different methods.</p>

<p>Broth is simmered for hours with cinnamon, star anise and other warm spices to create a wonderfully aromatic base for this rice noodle soup.</p>
<p>Pho is among Vietnam’s most recognized culinary exports, but the soup is a relatively new food, wrote <a href="https://www.vietworldkitchen.com/blog/2018/03/the-history-of-pho.html">Andrea Nguyen</a>, author of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Pho-Cookbook-Adventurous-Vietnams-Favorite/dp/1607749580">“The Pho Cookbook.”</a></p>
<p>And while today’s pho restaurants serve a wide range of flavors, beef is the original. By 1930, Nguyen explained, the soup was served with slices of raw beef cooked gently in the broth.</p>
<p>Today, beef pho remains the most beloved version in Vietnam, with options that include the original raw beef, a mix of raw and cooked beef, brisket and tendon.</p>
<figure><picture><figure><img alt="Traditional Ukrainian Russian borscht or red soup in the  bowl." src="https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/210219165951-03-world-best-soups.jpg?c=original&amp;q=w_1093,c_fill"/><figcaption>Tender beets are just the start of borscht's tangy delights. Shutterstock</figcaption></figure></picture></figure>
<p>Chunks of tender beets swim in brilliant red broth for a soup that’s beloved in Ukraine and across Eastern Europe. Often topped with a rich dollop of sour cream, borscht is anything but basic beet soup. It gets a tangy kick from kvass, a lacto-fermented beet juice that’s another regional specialty.</p>
<p>And while the soup is sometimes attributed to Russian cuisine, that <a href="http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20191014-who-really-owns-borsch">claim is contested</a>.</p>
<p>In 2022, <a href="https://ich.unesco.org/en/USL/culture-of-ukrainian-borscht-cooking-01852">UNESCO declared</a> that borscht in Ukraine “unites people of all ages, genders and backgrounds at the table” and placed the soup on its list of Intangible Cultural Heritage in Need of Urgent Safeguarding. And individual Ukrainian chefs are doing their part to make the soup <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ukrainain-borsch-borscht-cultural-preservation-chef-food-ec0bd5ce731fe28cf4b35479c0eec911">a symbol of the nation.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/15/travel/best-sandwiches-world"><figure><picture><figure><img alt="&lt;strong&gt;Bocadillo de jamón Ibérico, Spain: &lt;/strong&gt;Simple and delicious, the star here is Spain's prized Iberian ham, thinly sliced and piled on crusty bread that's brushed with extra virgin olive oil.

<figure><picture><figure><img alt="Bouillabaisse is synonymous with Marseille, France." src="https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/210219165916-01-world-best-soups.jpg?c=original&amp;q=w_1093,c_fill"/><figcaption>Bouillabaisse, which is popular in Marseille, France, contains multiple types of seafood. Shutterstock</figcaption></figure></picture></figure>
<p>A fisherman’s stew turned culinary icon, bouillabaisse distills classic Mediterranean flavors into a dish synonymous with the coastal city of Marseille. Saffron, olive oil, fennel, garlic and tomatoes blend with fish fresh from the sea.</p>
<p>At one time, that fish would reflect each day’s catch, but things have gotten a bit stricter.</p>
<p>According to signatories of the <a href="https://www.hotel-restaurant-le-rhul.com/en/bouillabaisse-charter">1980 Bouillabaisse Charter</a> — a collective attempt by local chefs to ensure the quality of the French soup — the most authentic recipe must include at least four kinds of seafood <a href="https://www.marseille-tourisme.com/en/discover-marseille/gastronomy-in-marseille/bouillabaisse/">chosen from a list</a> that includes monkfish and crab.</p>
<figure><picture><figure><img alt="This hearty soup hails from Portugal's wine country." src="https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/201021112114-34-best-potato-dishes-photos-caldo-verde.jpg?c=original&amp;q=w_1093,c_fill"/><figcaption>This hearty soup, which sometimes includes sausage, hails from Portugal's wine country. Shutterstock</figcaption></figure></picture></figure>
<p>Thinly sliced greens meld with potatoes and onions in this homey soup from Portugal’s wine-producing Minho region. Now, the soup is a culinary star from upscale cafes to rural kitchens, the definition of down-home comfort food.</p>
<p>In many versions, tender Portuguese chouriço sausage adds an undercurrent of smoky, salty flavor that makes the soup even heartier. Enjoy alongside a glass of Minho’s famed vinho verde wine.</p>
<figure><picture><figure><img alt="Chorba frik is popular in North Africa after the sun sets during Ramadan." src="https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/210219170337-15-world-best-soups.jpg?c=original&amp;q=w_1093,c_fill"/><figcaption>Chorba frik is popular in North Africa as a way to break the fast during Ramadan. Shutterstock</figcaption></figure></picture></figure>
<p>Durum wheat harvested while green, called freekeh, adds satisfying heft and nourishment to this North African soup, which is especially beloved during the holy time of Ramadan.</p>
<p>The tender grains absorb a tomato broth and aromatic spices, their flavor melding with chickpeas plus stewed chicken, beef, mutton or lamb. Serve with lemon wedges and a hunk of kesra bread.</p>
<figure><picture><figure><img alt="&lt;strong&gt;Chupe de Camarones | Peru:&lt;/strong&gt; This creamy shrimp chowder with potatoes and corn gets a kick from the addition of ají amarillo, a chili pepper." src="https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/210219170436-19-world-best-soups-restricted.jpg?c=original&amp;q=w_1093,c_fill"/><figcaption>This hearty Peruvian soup has a kick to it and is considered an aphrodisiac.

<p>This creamy shrimp chowder is a specialty of Arequipa, a historic city surrounded by towering volcanoes. Cold nights in the mountains are perfect for the hearty dish: Tender shrimp swim alongside chunks of Andean potatoes and corn.</p>
<p>It’s got a kick, too. The addition of <a href="https://www.thespruceeats.com/aji-amarillo-peruvian-yellow-chile-pepper-3029288">ají amarillo</a>, a chili pepper with a lilting, fruity flavor, adds satisfying spice to balance out the rich and creamy ingredients. Maybe that explains the soup’s reputation as <a href="https://wapa.pe/trending/1239911-seduce-pareja-cuatro-platos-afrodisiacos-peru">a powerful aphrodisiac</a>.</p>
<figure><picture><figure><img alt="Gazpacho is a great way to enjoy a cold treat on a hot day." src="https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/210219165936-02-world-best-soups.jpg?c=original&amp;q=w_1093,c_fill"/><figcaption>Gazpacho, which is served cold, is a great way to find refreshment on a hot day. Shutterstock</figcaption></figure></picture></figure>
<p>Summer in Andalusia brings searing weather, ideal for cooling down with a bowl of this chilled vegetable soup. Today’s <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/gazpacho">most classic version</a> includes tomatoes, cucumbers, garlic and olive oil, with a handful of stale breadcrumbs added for body.</p>
<p>Arabs brought the dish to the Iberian Peninsula centuries before Spaniards tasted tomatoes, a New World ingredient. The original was a blend of bread, garlic and olive oil, pounded in a mortar and seasoned with vinegar.</p>
<figure><picture><figure><img alt="Sweet potatoes and okra are stars in this particular version of groundnut soup, popular throughout West Africa." src="https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/210219170317-13-world-best-soups.jpg?c=original&amp;q=w_1093,c_fill"/><figcaption>Sweet potatoes and okra are stars in this particular version of groundnut soup, popular throughout West Africa.</figcaption></figure></picture></figure>
<p>As with so many culinary treats, groundnut soup ignores international boundaries: Meat, fish or chicken simmered into a thick peanut soup is pure comfort food in countries across West Africa. Versions range from Gambian domoda — the national dish — to a Nigerian take cooked with bitter, leafy greens.</p>
<p>No matter the country, such soups and stews are creamy, rich and salty, a satisfying combination that often gets a fiery jolt from the addition of Scotch bonnet peppers.</p>
<figure><picture><figure><img alt="Chicken, sausage and shrimp festoon this gumbo." src="https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/210219170510-20-world-best-soups-restricted.jpg?c=original&amp;q=w_1093,c_fill"/><figcaption>Gumbo, which can be served with chicken, sausage and shrimp, is associated with New Orleans.

<p>Cultures and flavors meld in a hearty soup that’s a star of Louisiana cuisine, influenced by West African, Native Choctaw and French cuisines. Versions made with seafood, chicken and sausage are among the most popular today, but there are <a href="https://www.southernfoodways.org/oral-history/southern-gumbo-trail/">myriad ways to make this Southern specialty</a>.</p>
<p>Ground, dried sassafras leaves — called filé and long harvested by the Choctaw people — give many gumbo recipes a distinctive spice. Some cooks thicken their soup with a cooked flour paste called roux, while others swear by sautéed slices of okra.</p>
<p>Every possible version is on display each year at the<a href="https://www.iberiatravel.com/events/world-championship-gumbo-cookoff"> World Champion Gumbo Cookoff </a>in New Iberia, Louisiana, where cooks battle for some serious soup-master bragging rights.</p>
<figure><picture><figure><img alt="Moroccan harira uses chickpeas in a savory tomato broth to superb effect." src="https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/210219170352-16-world-best-soups.jpg?c=original&amp;q=w_1093,c_fill"/><figcaption>Moroccan harira uses chickpeas in a savory tomato broth to superb effect. Shutterstock</figcaption></figure></picture></figure>
<p>When the sun sets during the month of Ramadan, many Moroccans break their fasts with a hot bowl of this <a href="https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/spiced-moroccan-vegetable-soup-with-chickpeas-cilantro-and-lemon-harira">comforting chickpea stew</a>. Cinnamon, ginger, turmeric and pepper lend warming spice to the savory tomato broth, which soaks into tender chickpeas. It’s also widely enjoyed in Algeria.</p>
<p>While vegetarian recipes are popular, the most classic version is simmered with tender chunks of lamb or other meat. It’s not just fasting fare for Muslims; some North African Jews also prepare harira to <a href="https://forward.com/food/455164/hot-moroccan-harira-soup-beats-cold-fish-for-yom-kippur-break-fast/">break the annual fast of Yom Kippur</a>.</p>
<figure><picture><figure><img alt="A plum sauce gives kharcho its zesty flavor." src="https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/210219170025-05-world-best-soups.jpg?c=original&amp;q=w_1093,c_fill"/><figcaption>A plum sauce gives kharcho, a Georgian specialty, its zesty flavor. Shutterstock</figcaption></figure></picture></figure>
<p>Tart plum sauce called <a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/recipes/tkemali-sour-plum-sauce">tkemali</a> adds bright, zesty flavor to this traditional soup, which is one of Georgia’s most beloved dishes.</p>
<p>It’s made with unripe plums, whose sour note balances the richness of fatty beef and ground walnuts cooked into the soup. The aromatic kick, though, comes from the spice mix khmeli suneli, a blend of coriander, savory, fenugreek, black pepper, marigold and more.</p>
<figure><picture><figure><img alt="Of course a Chinese soup makes the best 20 list -- one taste of lanzhou beef noodle soup will tell you whyl" src="https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/210219170206-10-world-best-soups.jpg?c=original&amp;q=w_1093,c_fill"/><figcaption>Homemade noodles are at the heart of the popularity of this Chinese beef soup. Shutterstock</figcaption></figure></picture></figure>
<p>Shaping — or pulling — <a href="https://redhousespice.com/hand-pulled-noodles/">la mian noodles</a> by hand for this traditional soup is an art in itself. Artisans use a finely milled, high-gluten flour and alkaline powder to mix a stretchy dough, then <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BjNTKSLAyVS/?igshid=1fy9f6k0viz8t">pull and fold</a> a single piece of dough to make enough noodles for a bowl of soup.</p>
<p>Slip them into a bowl of beef broth for a world-class soup that includes tender beef, pale slices of radish, chili oil and fresh herbs. (At some shops, diners may even ask for noodles of a preferred thickness and shape.)</p>
<figure><picture><figure><img alt="This version of mohinga features catfish, rice noodles, chicken eggs and lime. " src="https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/210219170225-11-world-best-soups.jpg?c=original&amp;q=w_1093,c_fill"/><figcaption>This version of mohinga features catfish, rice noodles, chicken eggs and lime. Shutterstock</figcaption></figure></picture></figure>
<p>Soup is what’s for breakfast in much of Myanmar, where sidewalk vendors and tea shops hawk steaming bowls of mohinga out of enormous vats. The soul of this noodle soup is the aromatic broth, which is simmered with herbs and thickened with toasted rice powder.</p>
<p>Fish lends added richness, while the thin rice noodles are perfect for slurping. Mohinga is so beloved that it’s gone from breakfast dish to anytime snack, and each region has its own twist on the classic soup.</p>
<figure><picture><figure><img alt="Menudo is a traditional Mexican soup made with tripe and hominy. It's touted for its curative effects for hangovers." src="https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/210219170408-17-world-best-soups.jpg?c=original&amp;q=w_1093,c_fill"/><figcaption>Menudo is a traditional Mexican soup made with tripe and hominy. Shutterstock</figcaption></figure></picture></figure>
<p>Tripe simmered for hours in a piquant, garlicky broth is the ultimate Mexican hangover cure, but menudo goes far beyond morning-after remedies. It’s a favorite at weddings and big occasions, too, when an enormous pot of the traditional soup can feed dozens of guests.</p>
<p>It’s sheer comfort food, with kernels of hominy that get fresh bite from a garnish of raw onions, chiles and cilantro. Choose from one of two main varieties: Menudo rojo turns a deep red from chiles in the broth, while Sonoran-style Menudo blanco is a milder alternative.</p>
<figure><picture><figure><img alt="Shrimp floating in a coconut broth? Count us in for moqueca de camarão." src="https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/210219170421-18-world-best-soups.jpg?c=original&amp;q=w_1093,c_fill"/><figcaption>Shrimp float in a coconut broth in this Brazilian soup, enjoyed even in the summer months. Shutterstock</figcaption></figure></picture></figure>
<p>Palm oil and tomatoes tint coconut broth a warm, orangey red in this specialty from the Bahia region of Brazil, where locals eat steaming bowls on even the hottest days.</p>
<p>This soup’s real draw is sweet, tender shrimp floating in the broth, however. Traditionally, moqueca de camarão is cooked in a handmade pot made from black clay and the sap of mangrove trees, then brought to the table in the same authentic vessel.</p>
<figure><picture><figure><img alt="This is chicken noodle soup with an indulgent Indonesian twist." src="https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/210219170152-09-world-best-soups.jpg?c=original&amp;q=w_1093,c_fill"/><figcaption>This chicken noodle soup is enjoyed throughout Indonesia, with regional twists. Shutterstock</figcaption></figure></picture></figure>
<p>Chicken noodle soup may reach its culinary pinnacle in this piquant Indonesian dish. Spices such as fresh turmeric, star anise, cinnamon, lemongrass and lime leaves combine for deeply layered aroma and flavor, with the jammy yolks of soft-boiled eggs to add extra richness.</p>
<p>Every part of Indonesia has a local twist, and the soup is also beloved in Singapore, Malaysia and in faraway Suriname in South America, where the recipe arrived with Javanese immigrants.</p>
<p>Eat topped with fried shallots, fresh limes and a fiery scattering of sliced red chiles.</p>
<figure><picture><figure><img alt="&lt;strong&gt;Tom yum goong | Thailand:&lt;/strong&gt; Hitting major taste sensations -- sweet, sour, spicy and salty -- this soup's broth is the ideal environment for sweet, tender shrimp or other seafood." src="https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/210219170239-12-world-best-soups-restricted.jpg?c=original&amp;q=w_1093,c_fill"/><figcaption>This Thai soup features a broth that pairs well with shrimp or other seafood.

<p>Sweet, sour, spicy and salty, this soup’s magnificent broth is the ideal foil for sweet, tender shrimp. Aromatic ingredients include galangal, lemongrass and lime leaves, while slivers of bright red bird’s eye chilis add additional heat.</p>
<p>Tom yum goong is just one of many varieties of tom yum soup in Thailand — this version comes enriched with fat prawns, and is a favorite with many diners.</p>
<figure><picture><figure><img alt="This classic ramen soup is flavored with pork bones." src="https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/210219170135-08-world-best-soups.jpg?c=original&amp;q=w_1093,c_fill"/><figcaption>This classic ramen soup, which diners love to slurp, is flavored with pork bones. Shutterstock</figcaption></figure></picture></figure>
<p>Long-simmered pork bones impart intense flavor to this classic ramen, whose broth is cloudy with marrow and fat. It’s a signature of <a href="https://www.fukuoka-now.com/en/rwc/deep-fukuoka/tonkotsu-ramen/">Fukuoka Prefecture</a> on the southerly island of Kyushu, but the rich soup is now served in ramen shops across the country (and world).</p>
<p>While the indulgent broth is the star of tonkotsu ramen, a bowl isn’t complete without slices of pork belly and a tangle of noodles that are hard in the center. Eat with a pair of chopsticks and a flat-bottomed spoon, and don’t forget to slurp — it’s believed to enhance the flavor.</p>
<figure><picture><figure><img alt="Yayla çorbasi speaks to a time when soup and medicine weren't considered such separate things. " src="https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/210219170057-06-world-best-soups.jpg?c=original&amp;q=w_1093,c_fill"/><figcaption>Yayla çorbasi is so prized as a dish that it's considered a homespun medicine by many in Turkey. Shutterstock</figcaption></figure></picture></figure>
<p>Boiled rice or barley adds grainy sweetness to this creamy yogurt soup. It’s believed to ward off colds during winter; some Turkish hospitals even serve yogurt soup to recovering patients.</p>
<p>A crumble of dried mint helps balance the yogurt’s slight tang. Serve with a pillowy round of fresh pita bread.</p>
