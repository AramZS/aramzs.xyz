<p>Before he was the star plaintiff in an audacious lawsuit targeting a Bay Area doctor and interstate access to abortion medication, Jerry Hernandez Rodriguez was somewhere in Texas ducking a warrant for allegedly beating his girlfriend.</p>
<p>It was Nov. 7, 2024. Rodriguez, previously convicted of assaulting one woman and threatening to kill another, phoned the Webster Police Department to call his latest accuser a liar. When a detective answered, department records show, Rodriguez told him he was aware of the felony arrest warrant, but wouldn’t divulge his whereabouts.</p>

<p>Eight months later, Rodriguez resurfaced with a new story — one that presented him not as an abuser of women but as a victim of their reproductive choices. His girlfriend’s abortions, he said in his lawsuit, constituted the killing of his unborn children.</p>
<p>The image makeover came courtesy of Jonathan Franklin Mitchell, a <a data-link="native" data-modified-href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/california/article/shield-law-abortion-ban-21208348.php" data-mrf-link="https://www.sfchronicle.com/california/article/shield-law-abortion-ban-21208348.php" href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/california/article/shield-law-abortion-ban-21208348.php">prominent conservative attorney</a> and key figure in the campaign to push a nationwide abortion ban through the courts.</p>
<p>A former Texas solicitor general who successfully represented President Donald Trump in a 2024 election lawsuit, Mitchell devised the enforcement strategy behind a bill that banned most abortions in Texas when Roe v. Wade was still law. Imposing the ban through the threat of private lawsuits rather than government action, Mitchell stumped the Supreme Court and provided a template for other red states, while creating millions of potential new clients for his anti-abortion litigation.</p>
<p>Now, with Rodriguez as one of those clients, Mitchell has crafted a sweeping challenge to medication abortion access.</p>
<p>In their federal lawsuit, Mitchell and Rodriguez say the plaintiff’s girlfriend “killed Mr. Rodriguez’s unborn son” and ended an earlier pregnancy “with abortion pills that were illegally obtained” from <a data-link="native" data-modified-href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/california/article/abortion-shield-laws-test-21293129.php" data-mrf-link="https://www.sfchronicle.com/california/article/abortion-shield-laws-test-21293129.php" href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/california/article/abortion-shield-laws-test-21293129.php">Dr. Remy Coeytaux of Sonoma County</a>. The suit, which names the woman but seeks injunctions and unspecified damages against Coeytaux, does not mention the woman’s abuse claims against Rodriguez.</p>
<p>It is not the first Mitchell lawsuit to omit problematic information about a male plaintiff, the Chronicle found. But it may be the most consequential.</p>

<p>“The Comstock Act has been on Jonathan Mitchell’s radar screen for a long time,” said Rachel Rebouché, a professor at the University of Texas School of Law in Austin and faculty director of its Sissy Farenthold Reproductive Justice Defense Project.</p>
<p>So far, Mitchell has been unable to persuade a judge to apply his legal interpretation. But even some of his critics believe Mitchell is advancing on his goal, in part because of how Trump has shaped the federal judiciary through conservative appointments.</p>
<p>“Mitchell is playing the long game,” said Kate Hoeting, a senior adviser at Catholics for Choice, a Washington D.C. nonprofit that supports abortion access. “He knows the system is rigged for his success.”</p>
<p>Mitchell, 49, declined to be interviewed about his work or clients. “I respect and appreciate your willingness to hear my perspective,” he said by email. “But I don’t want to discuss those topics with the media, at least not now.”</p>
<p>Rodriguez, 57, did not respond to phone calls or emails, though someone from his number texted, “Do not call or text this number again or i will report you for harassment.”</p>
<p>The woman named in the lawsuit did not respond to emails, and her phone number no longer accepted calls. The Chronicle is not naming her because she is an alleged abuse victim.</p>
<p>In court filings, the two men say Rodriguez is acting “on behalf of … all current and future fathers of unborn children in the United States.” The allegations against Rodriguez — previously unreported but publicly available — show the lengths Mitchell will go to achieve his vision, say multiple people opposed to it.</p>
<p>“It’s a war to control women and their bodies,” said California Assembly Member Maggy Krell, D-Sacramento, a former state prosecutor and Planned Parenthood attorney. “He’s siding with abusers.”</p>

<p>On Oct. 29, 2024, two police officers from Webster, a small suburb between Houston and Galveston, entered a local hospital and made their way to Emergency Room 17. There, they found a petite woman in her late 30s bearing the alleged hallmarks of Jerry Rodriguez’s temper.</p>
<p>Officer Colton Pitts saw dried blood on her lip, cuts on her chest and cheeks, and red streaks on her neck. The marks were “consistent with a strangulation attack,” Pitts wrote in his police report, which the Chronicle obtained through a public records request.</p>
<p>That Tuesday night was warm and clear, Pitts noted in his report. According to the woman, it began with modest expectations.</p>
<p>She told officers she was in an open marriage and had been seeing Rodriguez for five months. Rodriguez, short and stocky with a graying goatee and fading tattoos, had rented a room at a Motel 6 so they could hang out, she said.</p>
<p>The pair watched TV, then Rodriguez left to pick up his mother’s car from a mechanic. The woman said she took out a set of press-on nails and began gluing them on. Some time later, Rodriguez returned with dinner and they ate. Then Rodriguez noticed the nails and erupted, the woman said.</p>
<p>Shouting that “she was irresponsible with money,” Rodriguez allegedly grabbed her by the neck and slammed her to the floor, the police report states. The woman said she “was seeing stars” when Rodriguez got on top of her and started hitting. She counted 12 punches and slaps. Then she felt Rodriguez “squeeze her throat” like he was trying to “crush” it, Pitts wrote.</p>
<p>She said she thrashed, but that Rodriguez smothered her face and told her to cooperate. She said she couldn’t breathe and “believed she was going to die,” Pitts wrote. She went still.</p>
<p>After about a minute, the woman guessed, Rodriguez climbed off but continued to berate her. When Rodriguez stepped toward the bathroom, the woman said, she dashed out of the ground-floor motel room. She said Rodriguez started to chase, but stopped when he saw the foot traffic outside.</p>
<p>The woman covered roughly 120 yards of patchy parking lot and ducked into a Waffle House. A short time later, she hailed a ride to HCA Houston Healthcare Clear Lake and called police, telling the dispatcher that “all she wanted to do was escape,” the call log states.</p>

<p>The call would be one of the more than 250,000 domestic violence incidents reported to law enforcement in Texas that year, according to the state’s Council on Family Violence. In a nation where homicide was the <a data-link="native" data-modified-href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/homicide-leading-cause-of-death-for-pregnant-women-in-u-s" data-mrf-link="https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/homicide-leading-cause-of-death-for-pregnant-women-in-u-s/" href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/homicide-leading-cause-of-death-for-pregnant-women-in-u-s/">leading cause of death for pregnant women</a> under Roe, a November 2025 <a data-link="native" data-modified-href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167629625001092" data-mrf-link="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167629625001092" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167629625001092">study</a> in the Journal of Health Economics found that reported domestic violence against women “significantly increased” in states that banned abortion after Roe fell.</p>
<p>In 2006, Rodriguez pleaded guilty to assaulting a woman he was living with in Harris County by striking her in the mouth. Three years later in Brazoria County, he pleaded guilty to harassment for “repeatedly” threatening to kill a woman over the phone. For the two crimes, both charged as misdemeanors, he spent a total of two days in jail.</p>
<p>From her hospital room, the woman estimated Rodriguez had “strangled her 8 times” over the previous five months and said “he makes threats that he will kill her and that will make her his ‘15th’ kill,” Pitts recorded.</p>
<p>It’s possible she was pregnant when she said this.</p>
<p>Rodriguez says in court filings that he and the woman learned she was pregnant in late October 2024. Pitts’ police report, taken Oct. 29, doesn’t mention a pregnancy. But it does say the woman was afraid of Rodriguez and had concealed his abuse before.</p>
<p>Three weeks before the motel incident, Rodriguez brought the woman to the same hospital with a two-inch gash on her forehead, a reddened neck and various scrapes. He reportedly told officers from a different agency that the woman’s husband was to blame.</p>
<p>Rodriguez was the actual assailant, the woman later told Pitts, but because Rodriguez had been next to her in the hospital, “she felt duress to agree with the lie.” Police records confirm that Rodriguez was present for some of the interview.</p>
<p>The Galveston County District Attorney’s Office withdrew a felony assault charge against the husband after learning of the false allegation, a spokesperson said.</p>
<p>The case against Rodriguez would hit different snags.</p>

<p>At the ER, officers photographed the woman’s injuries and filled out what local authorities call “a strangulation form.” They went looking for Rodriguez, but didn’t find him at the motel or his mother’s house. The next day, officers obtained an arrest warrant and Harris County prosecutors charged Rodriguez with felony assault of a family or household member.</p>
<p>Rodriguez was a no-show for his first court appearance, records indicate, and remained at large for eight months. He spent at least some of that time with his alleged victim, he later asserted.</p>
<p>In the lawsuit he and Mitchell filed, Rodriguez says he went with the woman to a sonogram appointment in January 2025. He says that she aborted the pregnancy at her husband’s house later that month and that in May 2025 — while still being sought by police — he impregnated the woman again, the third time in 11 months.</p>
<p>That pregnancy coincided with another crisis.</p>
<p>On May 9, 2025, the woman turned herself in to the Galveston County Sheriff’s Office on an outstanding warrant for possessing less than 28 grams of alprazolam, the generic name for Xanax. Her booking photo shows a woman with a tousled bun, hollow cheeks and a resigned expression. Two months later, a judge ordered her to pay $3,000 and sentenced her to five days in jail — harsher punishment than Rodriguez received for hurting two women.</p>
<p>It was an anonymous tip that finally led to Rodriguez’s arrest. The tipster’s information wasn’t exotic: The fugitive was at work.</p>
<p>On July 8, 2025, officers with the Pasadena (Texas) Police Department arrested Rodriguez mid-shift at a local Harley-Davidson dealership. He got out on bail the next day.</p>
<p>Rodriguez claimed financial hardship in a handwritten affidavit that reported $2,420 in monthly expenses — including $600 in rent to his mother and $600 in child support — against a $1,600 monthly income. He said he had $60 in his checking account and a teenage son who relied on his financial support. The court found Rodriguez to be indigent and appointed him a public defender.</p>
<p>Eleven days later, he was being represented by Mitchell, who <a data-link="native" data-modified-href="https://ia803105.us.archive.org/2/items/gov.uscourts.txsd.1487461/gov.uscourts.txsd.1487461.21.0.pdf" data-mrf-link="https://ia803105.us.archive.org/2/items/gov.uscourts.txsd.1487461/gov.uscourts.txsd.1487461.21.0.pdf" href="https://ia803105.us.archive.org/2/items/gov.uscourts.txsd.1487461/gov.uscourts.txsd.1487461.21.0.pdf">commanded nearly $700 an hour in 2018 when he entered private practice</a>.</p>

<p>It remains Jonathan Mitchell’s finest lawyering to date.</p>
<p>In May 2021, a full year before Roe’s repeal, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed Senate Bill 8, prohibiting abortion after six weeks. The Texas Heartbeat Act flouted the constitutional right that Roe had afforded for nearly five decades. Mitchell, a private attorney, devised the “bounty hunter” provision that galled defenders of reproductive health care and judicial precedent.</p>
<p>Offering $10,000 in potential damages for lawsuits against anyone who, <a data-link="native" data-modified-href="https://capitol.texas.gov/tlodocs/87R/billtext/pdf/sb00008f.pdf" data-mrf-link="https://capitol.texas.gov/tlodocs/87R/billtext/pdf/sb00008f.pdf" href="https://capitol.texas.gov/tlodocs/87R/billtext/pdf/sb00008f.pdf">in the bill’s language</a>, “aided or abetted” abortions in Texas, SB8 incentivized private citizens to bring civil suits.</p>
<p>The law took effect in September 2021, paralyzing the state’s abortion providers and tying the Supreme Court in knots. At oral arguments that November, Mitchell delivered a technical defense, saying there was no relief the court could craft without unintended consequences.</p>
<p>The court’s conservative majority, minus Chief Justice John Roberts, <a data-link="native" data-modified-href="https://www.scotusblog.com/2021/12/court-leaves-texas-six-week-abortion-ban-in-effect-and-narrows-abortion-providers-challenge" data-mrf-link="https://www.scotusblog.com/2021/12/court-leaves-texas-six-week-abortion-ban-in-effect-and-narrows-abortion-providers-challenge/" href="https://www.scotusblog.com/2021/12/court-leaves-texas-six-week-abortion-ban-in-effect-and-narrows-abortion-providers-challenge/">let the ban stand</a>.

<p>The eldest of seven boys from a Christian family in Pennsylvania, Mitchell graduated from the University of Chicago Law School in 2001 and quickly gained entry to momentously powerful rooms. He clerked for Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia during a term that saw <a data-link="native" data-modified-href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3164003" data-mrf-link="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3164003" href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3164003">his hero</a> on the losing side of decisions favoring affirmative action and sexual privacy, then joined the Bush administration’s Office of Legal Counsel just months after the invasion of Iraq.</p>
<p>Come 2010, Mitchell was teaching law at George Mason University in Virginia when he was unexpectedly offered the chance to be Texas’ solicitor general, a position that let him apply what he’d learned about conservative legal strategy.</p>
<p>Over the next four years, Mitchell represented the state three times <a data-link="native" data-modified-href="https://www.oyez.org/advocates/jonathan_f_mitchell" data-mrf-link="https://www.oyez.org/advocates/jonathan_f_mitchell" href="https://www.oyez.org/advocates/jonathan_f_mitchell">before the Supreme Court</a> and developed a reputation for sharp, sometimes cutting legal arguments. As the New Yorker reported, the Fifth Circuit once rebuked his office for a “disturbingly unprofessional tone.”</p>
<p>Brigitte Amiri, the deputy director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s Reproductive Freedom Project, encountered Mitchell in 2013, when the ACLU <a data-link="native" data-modified-href="https://www.aclu.org/cases/planned-parenthood-v-abbott" data-mrf-link="https://www.aclu.org/cases/planned-parenthood-v-abbott" href="https://www.aclu.org/cases/planned-parenthood-v-abbott">challenged</a> <a data-link="native" data-modified-href="https://www.texastribune.org/2013/07/10/take-two-house-debates-proposed-abortion-regulatio" data-mrf-link="https://www.texastribune.org/2013/07/10/take-two-house-debates-proposed-abortion-regulatio/" href="https://www.texastribune.org/2013/07/10/take-two-house-debates-proposed-abortion-regulatio/">Texas legislation</a> requiring abortion providers to obtain hospital admitting privileges and clinics to meet surgical center standards.</p>
<p>Mitchell was part of a trial team that Amiri’s side complained had delayed evidence disclosures, jeopardized patient privacy and pulled courtroom stunts like telling a witness on the stand that his clinic was about to be raided.</p>
<p>“I can generally say everyone should litigate zealously for their clients,” she said, “but there were some tactics that … stay with me to this day.”</p>

<p>Mitchell has said he left the Texas Attorney General’s Office in 2015 intending to restart his academic career. But outside of a few teaching stints, including at Stanford Law School, elite universities weren’t interested. And despite being a volunteer attorney on Trump’s first transition team, roles proffered by the new administration fizzled.</p>
<p>“I needed to figure out something else to do,” Mitchell told the New Yorker.</p>
<p>In 2018, he opened Mitchell Law PLLC. Court records show the tiny firm has been prolific.</p>
<p>Mitchell sued teachers unions in <a data-link="native" data-modified-href="https://ballotpedia.org/Martin_v._California_Teachers_Association" data-mrf-link="https://ballotpedia.org/Martin_v._California_Teachers_Association" href="https://ballotpedia.org/Martin_v._California_Teachers_Association">California</a> and a half-dozen other states over their ability to collect dues.

<p>He also filed dozens of legal actions against cities, nonprofits, doctors, friends and relatives who assist abortion seekers.</p>
<p>Lately, these actions have taken the form of wrongful-death lawsuits — like the one against Coeytaux, the Bay Area doctor — that name women who allegedly terminated pregnancies, use inflammatory language to describe abortion and invoke the Comstock Act for the purposes of a national ban.</p>
<p>Mitchell characterized his legal philosophy to the New Yorker as rational textualism — the idea that the law is about what it says, not how it’s interpreted, “consequences be darned.”</p>
<p>Yet five attorneys who have battled him in court and four legal and reproductive health scholars familiar with his work say he has a penchant for taking conservative culture-war cases of questionable merit.</p>
<p>“He’s throwing a bunch of spaghetti at the wall,” said Amiri, whose organization fended off Mitchell in 2020 and 2023 when ACLU litigation compelled his clients, officials in <a data-link="native" data-modified-href="https://www.aclutx.org/cases/texas-equal-access-fund-lilith-fund-v-city-waskom-et-al" data-mrf-link="https://www.aclutx.org/cases/texas-equal-access-fund-lilith-fund-v-city-waskom-et-al/" href="https://www.aclutx.org/cases/texas-equal-access-fund-lilith-fund-v-city-waskom-et-al/">Texas</a> and <a data-link="native" data-modified-href="https://www.acluohio.org/press-releases/social-workers-and-advocates-successfully-force-lebanon-oh-remove-draconian-aiding" data-mrf-link="https://www.acluohio.org/press-releases/social-workers-and-advocates-successfully-force-lebanon-oh-remove-draconian-aiding/" href="https://www.acluohio.org/press-releases/social-workers-and-advocates-successfully-force-lebanon-oh-remove-draconian-aiding/">Ohio</a>, to walk back ordinances classifying abortion support groups as criminal organizations. “I’m sure for the people who are sued by Mitchell, it has a profound impact on their lives, even if the case does get dismissed.”</p>
<p>That’s true of the women Mitchell identifies in his lawsuits, said Marc Hearron, associate litigation director at the Center for Reproductive Rights.</p>
<p>“These cases are sweeping up people who are just trying to live their lives,” Hearron, who represents Coeytaux, said of Texas abortion seekers. “(They) didn’t ask to be involved in this, didn’t ask for their names to come out.”</p>
<p>As for the men Mitchell represents, at least three have been accused of harming women, the Chronicle found.</p>
<p>In April 2022, Mitchell filed a federal lawsuit on behalf of an unnamed Texas Christian University student who had been suspended for sexually assaulting his ex-girlfriend. Court records show the male student admitted in <a data-link="native" data-modified-href="https://www.atixa.org/blog/judge-grants-preliminary-injunction-for-illogical-reasoning-bias-and-policy-deviations-in-title-ix-case" data-mrf-link="https://www.atixa.org/blog/judge-grants-preliminary-injunction-for-illogical-reasoning-bias-and-policy-deviations-in-title-ix-case/" href="https://www.atixa.org/blog/judge-grants-preliminary-injunction-for-illogical-reasoning-bias-and-policy-deviations-in-title-ix-case/">text messages</a> to being a rapist. The lawsuit, accusing the university of gender discrimination, was eventually dismissed.</p>
<p>In March 2023, Mitchell represented Marcus A. Silva, who sued his ex-wife’s three friends in Galveston County civil court for allegedly helping her arrange a medication abortion. Silva <a data-link="native" data-modified-href="https://www.texastribune.org/2024/10/11/texas-abortion-assistance-lawsuit-dropped" data-mrf-link="https://www.texastribune.org/2024/10/11/texas-abortion-assistance-lawsuit-dropped/" href="https://www.texastribune.org/2024/10/11/texas-abortion-assistance-lawsuit-dropped/">dropped the lawsuit</a> the next year, after his alleged record of verbal and emotional abuse surfaced in court documents, among them a Ring video transcript in which he acknowledged using legal threats to extort sex from his ex-wife.</p>
<p>Texas Supreme Court Chief Justice Jimmy Blacklock denounced Silva’s behavior in a scathing <a data-link="native" data-modified-href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/law.justia.com/cases/texas/supreme-court/2024/24-0284.html__;!!ApXA7kLm!1hv5K47EiDeoGuP7k2ZHsgln2B3UjW8VH7xoIjPlNAhtRV60-o3eh99rloNAFN_QQK89CyHRADMQdYVp3Varb7-exBbr%24" data-mrf-link="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/law.justia.com/cases/texas/supreme-court/2024/24-0284.html__;!!ApXA7kLm!1hv5K47EiDeoGuP7k2ZHsgln2B3UjW8VH7xoIjPlNAhtRV60-o3eh99rloNAFN_QQK89CyHRADMQdYVp3Varb7-exBbr%24" href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/law.justia.com/cases/texas/supreme-court/2024/24-0284.html__;!!ApXA7kLm!1hv5K47EiDeoGuP7k2ZHsgln2B3UjW8VH7xoIjPlNAhtRV60-o3eh99rloNAFN_QQK89CyHRADMQdYVp3Varb7-exBbr%24">concurring opinion</a> denying Mitchell’s request to depose the ex-wife — one of at least three women Mitchell has tried to compel into testimony about suspected abortions on behalf of their former male partners.</p>
<p>Writing that Silva had engaged in “disgracefully vicious harassment and intimidation of his ex-wife … during the course of their marriage’s demise and during this litigation,” Blacklock added, “I can imagine no legitimate excuse for Marcus’s behavior as reflected in this record, many of the details of which are not fit for reproduction in a judicial opinion.”</p>
<p>Yet Hearron, who represented one of the women Silva sued, said this is exactly the type of plaintiff that Mitchell’s bounty hunter law attracts.</p>
<p>“What kind of person is going to answer that call?” Hearron said. “These are not going to be savory plaintiffs, and these are not going to be clean facts.”</p>

<p>A week after Rodriguez made bail, prosecutors began seeking more evidence connecting him to the months-old motel assault, Harris County court records show.</p>
<p>On July 15, 2024, Assistant District Attorney Lindsey Tizzard subpoenaed HCA Houston Healthcare for its treatment records of the victim. Tizzard requested charts, notes, X-rays, photos, blood, urine and lab results. In her HIPAA privacy law attestation, Tizzard noted that the request for potentially protected information “is not related to reproductive health care.”</p>
<p>Days later, Mitchell and Rodriguez made it all about reproductive health care — using the word “murder” more than a dozen times in their challenge to medication abortion access.</p>

Religious outlets showed less restraint, with the Christian Post and Focus on the Family’s Daily Citizen naming her 16 times between them.</p>
<p>On Aug. 14, 2025, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton issued a <a data-link="native" data-modified-href="https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/sites/default/files/images/press/Coeytaux%20Cease%20and%20Desist.pdf" data-mrf-link="https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/sites/default/files/images/press/Coeytaux%20Cease%20and%20Desist.pdf" href="https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/sites/default/files/images/press/Coeytaux%20Cease%20and%20Desist.pdf">cease-and-desist notice</a> to Coeytaux, keeping the case in the news.</p>
<p>The Harris County District Attorney’s Office filed a motion to dismiss the felony assault charge on Sept. 15, 2025, stating it could not prove it “beyond a reasonable doubt at this time.” A spokesperson for the office declined to say why. But the move happened after court officers appeared to lose contact with the victim.</p>
<p>On Sept. 4, 2025, a copy of the victim’s emergency protection order — informing her that Rodriguez was prohibited from threatening her and her family — bounced back to the court, stamped “return to sender.”</p>
<p>One federal <a data-link="native" data-modified-href="https://www.ojp.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/235284.pdf" data-mrf-link="https://www.ojp.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/235284.pdf" href="https://www.ojp.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/235284.pdf">study</a> found that half of domestic violence victims can’t or won’t participate in prosecutions, feeling torn between “wanting the violence to end … or becoming embroiled in a legal process perceived to be out of their control.”</p>
<p>“It’s very hard to understand what may cause a victim to not participate,” said Jennifer Gentile Long, a former Philadelphia prosecutor who co-founded Aequitas, a Washington, D.C., nonprofit focused on human trafficking and intimate partner violence prosecutions. “There’s more aspects of intimidation than get reported.”</p>
<p>Hoeting, the Catholics for Choice advocate, also works as an abortion doula, providing support to people undergoing the procedure. For those clients in abusive relationships, so much weighs on them already, she said.</p>
<p>“To add on the potential that Jonathan Mitchell could involve you and your name in a nationally relevant legal case,” she said, “that’s violence.”</p>
<p>Mitchell and Rodriguez also sued the woman’s husband and mother in Galveston County civil court. Claiming the defendants violated Texas’ wrongful death statute by ordering the abortion medication and letting the woman take it in their homes, the suit seeks more than $1 million in damages. Rodriguez withdrew his claim against the mother in November 2025. A jury trial is scheduled for October.</p>
<p>As for the higher-profile federal case, Mitchell <a data-link="native" data-modified-href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/california/article/abortion-shield-lawsuit-21329398.php" data-mrf-link="https://www.sfchronicle.com/california/article/abortion-shield-lawsuit-21329398.php" href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/california/article/abortion-shield-lawsuit-21329398.php">filed a long-anticipated amended complaint</a> this month. It takes advantage of a new Texas law that he helped inspire: House Bill 7, or the Woman and Child Protection Act, increases the bounty to $100,000 for private lawsuits against anyone who furnishes abortion pills in the state. It also asserts that shield laws like those in California, which insulate in-state providers from out-of-state sanctions, are no defense for violating Texas’ medication abortion ban.</p>
<p>The complaint ays that Coeytaux, also being <a data-link="native" data-modified-href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/california/article/abortion-shield-laws-test-21293129.php" data-mrf-link="https://www.sfchronicle.com/california/article/abortion-shield-laws-test-21293129.php" href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/california/article/abortion-shield-laws-test-21293129.php">sought for extradition by Louisiana</a>, “intends to continue mailing abortion-inducing drugs into Texas unless a federal court restrains him.”</p>
<p>Coeytaux declined to be interviewed. The website for his telemedical practice remains active. His attorneys last week signaled their intent to seek the federal suit’s dismissal by challenging Rodriguez’s standing and HB7’s constitutionality.</p>
<p>Anti-abortion groups, however, have high hopes that HB7 will force a Supreme Court reckoning between the half of the country that protects abortion and the half that outlaws it.</p>
<p>“This is the type of case that needs to escalate,” said John Seago, president of Texas Right to Life, a frequent Mitchell client. “And to do that, you need lawsuits.”</p>
<p>The amended complaint contains, between the lines, a notable update. In their July 2025 filings, Mitchell and Rodriguez asked for injunctions against Coeytaux, the woman’s husband and mother to prevent another abortion.</p>
<p>Their Feb. 2 filings make no such request. There is no longer a need.</p>
<p>In response to the Chronicle’s emails, Mitchell affirmed that Rodriguez’s alleged victim was still pregnant and due this month.</p>
<p>Krell, the California lawmaker who once defended abortion access as chief legal counsel for Planned Parenthood Affiliates of California, bristled at the implications.</p>
<p>“This is in essence a forced birth in open court,” she said.</p>
<p>As for the woman, she doesn’t have an attorney. No one, thus far, has publicly spoken on her behalf. But 3½ years ago, in a uniquely candid setting, she spoke for herself.</p>
<p>In July 2022, the woman appeared as a guest on a podcast about addiction and recovery. A promotional video showed her with a tidy brown bob that matched the sleek finish of her nails. Her sapphire eyes roved thoughtfully as she talked about staying sober by helping others.</p>
<p>The mother of three spoke as if she had finally turned a corner.</p>
<p>She said she was the oldest child of young, incompatible parents — a mother who “lovingly” called her “a fraternity one-night stand blessing” and a devout Catholic father who pressed for marriage.</p>
<p>She was 19 when she sampled a boyfriend’s Vicodin prescription and, she said, “felt comfortable in myself for the first time in my life.” Like <a data-link="native" data-modified-href="https://nida.nih.gov/publications/research-reports/prescription-opioids-heroin/prescription-opioid-use-risk-factor-heroin-use" data-mrf-link="https://nida.nih.gov/publications/research-reports/prescription-opioids-heroin/prescription-opioid-use-risk-factor-heroin-use" href="https://nida.nih.gov/publications/research-reports/prescription-opioids-heroin/prescription-opioid-use-risk-factor-heroin-use">generations of opioid users before her</a>, she eventually bargained her way to cheaper heroin.</p>
<p>She let out a laugh halfway between mortified and moonstruck. The first time she overdosed, the woman said, she awoke to her husband performing CPR. “My poor husband,” she called him — he saved her life.</p>
<p>She floundered between rehabs and relapses, overdosing twice more. She worked the 12 steps, but kept stumbling over the <a data-link="native" data-modified-href="https://fherehab.com/learning/step-2-what-is-a-higher-power" data-mrf-link="https://fherehab.com/learning/step-2-what-is-a-higher-power/" href="https://fherehab.com/learning/step-2-what-is-a-higher-power/">second</a>, a call to surrender to a higher power. She’d rejected her father’s religion, finding it too “fire and brimstone,” its God too controlling.</p>
<p>“That was not my type of God,” she said.</p>
<p>She was nearing the end of her latest stint in rehab. Her wrung-out husband wasn’t keen on her coming home. She entered a sober living house for four months, sharing chores, curfews and stories with women not so different from her. She felt a higher power at work, nudging her toward an epiphany: “I realized in order for me to stay sober, I had to help others,” she said.</p>
<p>She lobbied her husband to open a sober living house with her. She was passionate, persistent, a pain. “He gave in,” she said delightedly.</p>
<p>The sober house opened off Texas State Highway 146 in Galveston County. It was 12 steps-centered, with a director who loved animals, stood for social justice, gushed about her husband’s singing and felt like she was proving herself again.</p>
<p>“I love just the opportunity to be a refuge place for any woman that needs the extra help,” she said at the time. “I’m really blessed.”</p>
