<p><em>Update Feb 2: I added additional cautionary language about the legal/ethical considerations related to some of the techniques in the “OSINT Like a Hacker” video.</em></p>
<p>It’s challenging to keep up with all the tools, techniques, training, and resources constantly being released in the OSINT field. This post is the first in what will likely be a regular series where I spend time reading/watching/consuming OSINT content to extract the best information for our members. I’ll save you time and keep you up to date.</p>
<p>For this edition, I watched more than a dozen videos and synthesized insights from the 8 best. Most are from the 2025 SANS OSINT Summit, an event I’d been meaning to revisit. I also watched two recent videos. One is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUdyQDiZk2k">“No Pain No Gain: AI in the OSINT Intelligence Cycle”</a> from a recent event in Japan. The other is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKD1TxqOIyE">OSINT Like a Hacker with Mishaal Khan</a>. He taught me things about insurance quote websites and hotel WiFi that were insightful, though the techniques he used definitely raised legal/ethical questions.</p>
<p>I’ve summarized the best insights, tools, and techniques from each video in the hope of efficiently building your skills and knowledge.</p>
