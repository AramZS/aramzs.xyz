<p>Why I love these fucking Austinites mystifies me — listeners older than me will dismiss them as minor artists whose continuous refinements wipe them from existence. To my ears Spoon are the sultriest mofos in American college rock. I can’t explain how Britt Daniel’s chalky, high, comically white timbre has erotic force unless I pair it with his rhythm guitar. Forget Pavement — these guys are the elegant bachelors. The secret of Jim Eno’s I-am-a-machine patterns and Rob Pope’s mixed-high bass lines isn’t even concentration: it’s, to quote Bob Christgau about New Order, timing and rapport. I get how they can bore, but Daniel can’t bore me as a singer-guitarist.</p>
<p>The only album fans won’t see here is 2010’s <em>Transference</em>, which I’ve warmed to but still dismiss, “The Mystery Zone” and “Got Nuffin” aside, as too damn etiolated. Get this: I still haven’t heard <em>Telephono</em> or A <em>Series of Sneaks</em>. I need surprises. And as I once explained, glimpsing Daniel in cargo shorts at a Chipotle line at Pitchfork Music Festival a decade ago demystified him like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7vYP1S9_qQ">the Pepsi ad</a> did David Bowie and Tina Turner.</p>
<p>1. <em>Gimme Fiction</em> (2005)</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah — an example of First Album Heard Syndrome. But I return to <em>Gimme Fiction</em> every few months newly infatuated by how Spoon force their gnomic musical in-jokes and terse flourishes to register as expressions by men of flesh and blood. Daniel’s guitar cuts syncopated little figures everywhere, and his not quite English affectations produce strange allusions: “I Summon You” is a 1979 Nick Lowe track, the basic Jim Eno drum pattern and Daniel strums produce a minor masterpiece in triumphant self-regard in “They Never Got You.” How many bands can get away wit “Could you believe yourself/Could you repeat yourself?” <em>Cover a path to the heart, </em>he also sang. I believe that he believes; his studio EFX are fingers shaking for contact.</p>
<p>2. <em>Girls Can Tell</em> (2001)</p>
<p>My parents had “Hey Jude.” My parents have “Hold On, We’re Going Home.” Spoon wrote “The Fitted Shirt” for me. The only title that could be more on-brand is “The Performative Drinker” and “The Listmaker.” Daniel’s raucous guitar suggested the beast locked inside the iron lung of that shirt. “Take a Walk” and “Take the Fifth” need Ron Wood to be Stones-worthy belches of halitosis. The rest holds up, with “Everything Hits at Once” the thematic unguent.</p>
<p>3.<em> Hot Thoughts</em> (2017)</p>
<p>Then last year they released yet another excellent album — with Gang of Four rhythms (“Shotgun”) and laden with extra instrumentation (sax obviously but darbuka too!) but not as mannered as Gax5. Their most fun album since 2005, <em>Hot Thoughts</em> is Spoon’s most allusive too: forty-one minutes of pastiche. Daniel, Eno, Pope, and new keyboardist Alex Fischel marry concision to a use of space as a means to ease the pressure, a tightrope feat that gives this record its tension and sense of continental expansion. Fischel’s synth textures turn Daniel’s guitar white-hot, in every sense; to call him a soul man would get my blogging credentials revoked, but damned if he doesn’t turn “WhisperI’lllistentohearit” into Spoon’s “Cry to Me,” their sexiest track ever. “Can I Sit Next to You” has a riff as amiably clipped as the one CCR’s “Down on the Corner.” “I Ain’t the One” recasts Roxy Music’s “Chance Meeting” as a Dylan dismissal.</p>
<p>4. <em>Kill the Moonlight</em> (2003)</p>
<p>For many, KTM was the breakthrough. For me, it looked rather malnourished beside the more fulsome pleasures of <em>Gimme Fiction</em> or even beside the desiccated figures in <em>Girls Can Tell</em>. “The Way We Get By” worked as an intro, though, and the way it folded Iggy Pop’s “Some Weird Sin” as referent, lyrically and musically, suggests their modest genius: they gelled that 1977 rocker, polished its shoes, and rewrote it as an ideal for living. The rest of the tracks sound like another band’s fabulous demos: the beat boxing in “Stay Don’t Go,” better than Justin Timberlake’s; the keyboard loop and drumstick tap teasing Daniel’s falsetto in “Paper Tiger”; trying to reach out to other people in “Vittorio E” when in the grips of delicious formalism.</p>
<p>5. <em>They Want My Soul</em> (2014)</p>
<p>Don’t come close or Daniel will spray you with guitar venom. Spoon return from their longest hiatus even less capable of dealing with the pain of others. This time card sharks, palm readers, educated folk singers, even <em>Kill the Moonlight</em>‘s Jonathan Fisk want Britt’s soul. Had he been hanging out at circuses and Russian poker games during the Obama era?</p>
<p>6. <em>A Series of Snakes</em> (1998)</p>
<p>Note the Wire joke in the title. It makes sense, for this is their driest, most gnomic collection, as severe as Dreyer’s <em>Gertrud</em>. Britt Daniel’s was a strange new musical and singing voice in 1998. To imagine Spoon coming up with “You Got Yr. Cherry Bomb” is to imagine Colin Newman covering Christina Aguilera. The ooh-oohs in “Lafitte Don’t Fail Me Now” acknowledge pop history.</p>
<p>7. <em>Ga Ga Ga Ga Ga </em>(2007)</p>
<p>A line in “Black Like Me” gave its name to this blog and my life project. I find Gax5 underdeveloped these days; the ones with the fussy horns still sound fussy (“The Underdog,” “Your Got Yr. Cherry Bomb”). Paranoid Number: “Don’t Make Me a Target,” which may be about turning Spoon into a large department store. Anyway, the best song after my namesake is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSu6ixOlzmc">a cover</a>.</p>
<p>8. <em>Lucifer on the Sofa </em>(2022)</p>
<p>Their flossiest album to date, LOTS also sports their toughest guitars. “Wild,” “The Hardest Cut,” their Smog cover — rarely has Daniel’s pinched gnarl complemented the instrumental tracks. <a href="https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/spoon-lucifer-on-the-sofa/">I reviewed this album</a> for Pitchfork.</p>
