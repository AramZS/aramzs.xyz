<p><strong>Ran Avrahamy, CMO, AppsFlyer</strong></p>
<p>For more than a decade, CMOs have been told that better technology would finally solve their measurement problems. First, the solution was attribution. Then it was omnichannel dashboards. Now it’s AI.</p>
<p>But the uncomfortable truth many marketing leaders have discovered in real time is that AI hasn’t fixed measurement. It has made unreliable measurement more consequential, by accelerating decision making based on false confidence.</p>
<p>The pressure on modern CMOs has never been higher. Boards expect growth that is faster and more efficient, while the need to demonstrate that a business is AI-powered has become increasingly prevalent. CEOs expect marketing departments to be accountable, predictive, tech-savvy and resilient. And teams are expected to move at startup speed, even inside global enterprises.</p>
<p>Yet most marketing organizations are still operating on measurement systems built for a different era — one in which the web was the center of the customer journey, channels were fewer and signals were easier to interpret.</p>
<p>In reality, when a measurement foundation is shaky, adding AI doesn’t accelerate decisions; it accelerates the wrong ones and makes them harder to reverse.</p>
<h2><strong>The measurement gap marketers don’t want to acknowledge</strong></h2>
<p>Most CMOs will no longer say that measurement concerns are what keeps them up at night. Instead, they’ll mention AI, talent or speed. But measurement issues haven’t gone away. The integration of AI has made ignoring measurement foundations more costly because measurement is the infrastructure on which AI depends.</p>
<p>As the customer journey has fragmented, mobile in particular has become the center of much consumer behavior, and it is where measurement has been most stress tested by privacy changes and signal loss, regardless of where the conversions occur.</p>
<p>Many measurement systems still treat mobile as just another channel rather than as the connective tissue at the center of most modern customer journeys. The result is data that appears comprehensive on the surface, but is riddled with blind spots beneath. Conversions appear disconnected. Paths seem linear, but aren’t. Performance signals over index on what’s easiest to measure rather than what actually drives outcomes.</p>
<p>CMOs see this gap when measurement reports don’t line up with reality; when performance shifts but explanations lag; and when teams argue over which numbers are accurate. What’s changed is that AI now sits atop that gap.</p>
<h2><strong>How AI makes bad measurement worse</strong></h2>
<p>AI doesn’t reason. It infers. And it infers based on the data it’s given. But if that data is incomplete, biased toward certain channels or missing core behavioral signals — especially from mobile — AI compounds measurement issues, rather than correcting them.</p>
<p>AI systems are remarkably good at creating confidence. They produce forecasts, recommendations and optimizations that feel precise and authoritative. Dashboards look smarter, decisions feel faster and outputs seem sophisticated. But confidence does not equal accuracy. In practice, false confidence built on automated, default recommendations can lead to rapid, poor decision making.</p>
<p>When key signals are missing, AI fills the gaps with assumptions. When those assumptions are reinforced over time, budgets shift around them, and marketing strategies are locked in. Teams trust the outputs because they seem advanced, even when they’re grounded in data that is only partially accurate.</p>
<p>In other words, AI can give marketing leaders a false sense of certainty at the exact moment when they most need clarity. Once teams operationalize those outputs, the feedback loop is reinforced, making it harder and more expensive to fix early errors.</p>
<p>The real issue is data readiness. Most conversations about AI in marketing focus on tools, models and capabilities. But for CMOs, the foundational questions are simpler: Is the measurement infrastructure producing trustworthy data to drive AI-led decisions? And are teams vetting that information?</p>
<p>Trust is built on accuracy: Can marketers see how customers move across environments, not just within them? Can they connect exposure, engagement and outcomes across devices and channels? Can they distinguish actual consumer behavior from modeled guesswork? Without clear answers, AI becomes a multiplier of ambiguity.</p>
<p>This is why so many early AI marketing initiatives stalled or resulted in disappointment. It was not because the technology failed, but because the underlying measurement infrastructure was never designed for autonomous or semi-autonomous decision making. Measurement is not a supporting metric. It’s the foundational infrastructure that determines whether AI becomes an accelerator or a liability.</p>
<p>Once AI systems begin making recommendations or taking actions, the cost of getting measurement wrong rises exponentially.</p>
<h2><strong>Mobile is the center of gravity for measurement</strong></h2>
<p>For most consumers, and, by extension, brands, the center of gravity is mobile. Consumer identity is strongest on mobile, engagement is deepest and intent is most clearly expressed, even when the final transaction happens elsewhere. It’s also where marketers learned how to measure with less: fewer deterministic identifiers, tighter consent expectations and constant platform change.</p>
<p>Those mobile-grade standards should anchor measurement across all channels. Yet many measurement systems still treat mobile as another channel rather than the connective tissue linking the entire customer journey. Many technology stacks retrofit mobile measurement on existing systems — with web-era assumptions and reporting conventions adapted for modern apps rather than implemented with mobile-grade standards built for privacy constraints.</p>
<p>Without a reliable anchor point that holds up under privacy constraints, omnichannel measurement becomes a patchwork of proxies and assumptions. This is the point at which AI can mislead marketing teams. AI can connect signals, but it cannot fill in missing or unreliable ones. And when mobile is treated as a measurement afterthought, teams optimize to what their platforms can easily observe, but not to what customers actually do.</p>
<p>By implementing mobile-grade measurement standards, marketers give AI a grounded identity source and behaviors from which to work. Without that, they may get faster, but not better, optimization.</p>
<h2><strong>What forward-looking CMOs should do now</strong></h2>
<p>AI exposes where measurement breaks down, where assumptions hide and where decision-making confidence outpaces accurate outputs. It forces marketing organizations to confront a hard reality: Automation magnifies whatever uncertainty already exists.</p>
<p>To effectively implement AI, CMOs must first ask the following measurement questions:</p>
<ul> <li>Where are the biggest blind spots across channels and devices?</li> <li>Which decisions rely on modeled assumptions rather than observed behavior?</li> <li>What data is treated as a truthful source and why?</li> <li>Are measurement systems designed to support automation or reporting?</li> </ul>
<p>From there, the focus should shift away from adding AI tools to strengthening the measurement infrastructure on which those tools reside. AI works best when it sits on systems built for today’s complexity rather than being retrofitted onto frameworks designed for yesterday’s simplicity.</p>
<p>That means prioritizing data that reflects true customer behavior — especially on mobile — and designing measurement that connects customer journeys end to end, not channel by channel. It also means preparing teams to work with AI as a decision-making partner rather than a reporting tool.</p>
<p>CMOs now face a fork in the road: Treat measurement as the foundation for AI-driven marketing, anchored in mobile-grade standards that hold up under privacy pressure, or keep piecing together channel reports and feeding AI a partial view of reality. One path leads to faster decisions marketers can defend. The other produces faster decisions marketers cannot explain, until the quarter is over and the spend is gone.</p>
