<h2><strong>Federal news</strong></h2>
<p>A federal judge will hear arguments Tuesday about whether to end <strong>telemedicine prescriptions</strong> of the <strong>abortion pill mifepristone</strong> nationwide. Telehealth abortions using mifepristone and <strong>misoprostol</strong> made up <a href="https://societyfp.org/research/wecount/wecount-june-2025-data/?ref=autonomynews.co"><u>27% of all reported abortions</u></a> in 2025, so any changes in <strong>Food and Drug Administration</strong> regulation of mifepristone could be a huge blow to access—though providers could prescribe a regimen using misoprostol alone. There is sadly no audio access to the hearing, and Trump-appointed judge <strong>David Joseph</strong> could rule any time after it concludes. <strong>Louisiana</strong> sued the FDA over mifepristone in <a href="https://www.autonomynews.co/louisiana-sues-fda-over-abortion-pills-texas-healthcare-workers-arrested-and-more-october-13-news-roundup/"><u>October</u></a>, but in December took the extraordinary step of asking the court <a href="https://www.autonomynews.co/trump-extorts-hospitals-over-gender-affirming-care-new-york-governor-vetoes-repro-bills-december-22-news-roundup/#federal-news"><u>to reimpose</u></a> unnecessary in-person appointments while the case continues. The FDA recently asked Judge Joseph to <a href="https://www.autonomynews.co/trump-is-playing-games-on-abortion-to-avoid-impeachment/"><u>pause the litigation</u></a> until it completes a politically motivated safety review. That review, and reports that the FDA is seeking to delay it until <a href="https://www.ms.now/opinion/fda-abortion-pill-mifepristone-safety-study-trump-administration?ref=autonomynews.co"><u>after the midterms</u></a>, prompted the aggressive move from Louisiana’s attorneys at the Christian nationalist law firm <strong>Alliance Defending Freedom</strong>. ADF first sued the agency over mifepristone in Texas in 2022, but the Supreme Court ultimately determined the physician plaintiffs didn’t have legal standing to challenge FDA actions. Briefs opposing Louisiana’s request include: <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.lawd.213952/gov.uscourts.lawd.213952.158.1.pdf?ref=autonomynews.co"><u>19 states</u></a> and Washington D.C., <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.lawd.213952/gov.uscourts.lawd.213952.155.2.pdf?ref=autonomynews.co"><u>more than 100</u></a> reproductive rights and justice organizations, the <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.lawd.213952/gov.uscourts.lawd.213952.154.2.pdf?ref=autonomynews.co"><u>National Domestic Violence Hotline</u></a>, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (<a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.lawd.213952/gov.uscourts.lawd.213952.170.2.pdf?ref=autonomynews.co"><u>ACOG</u></a>), and <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.lawd.213952/gov.uscourts.lawd.213952.148.2.pdf?ref=autonomynews.co"><u>telehealth providers</u></a> Abortion on Demand and Hey Jane, which serve 25 states.</p>
<p>The FDA’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/31/tracy-beth-hoeg-fda-vaccines?ref=autonomynews.co"><u>underqualified</u></a> top drug regulator, <strong>Tracy Beth Høeg</strong>, said in her first speech to staff that she <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2026/02/19/tracy-beth-hoeg-fda-speech-to-staff-ssris-in-pregnancy-rsv-shots/?ref=autonomynews.co"><u>would scrutinize</u></a> <strong>pregnant people</strong>’s use of <strong>SSRI antidepressants</strong> and <strong>vaccines</strong> used to protect babies from RSV. RSV can kill infants and young children, and vaccines aren’t within Høeg’s purview, anyway. Antidepressants help keep some people alive during and after pregnancy. Høeg and FDA Commissioner <strong>Marty Makary</strong> <a href="https://www.fda.gov/patients/fda-expert-panels/fda-expert-panel-selective-serotonin-reuptake-inhibitors-ssris-and-pregnancy-07212025?ref=autonomynews.co"><u>led</u></a> a July panel <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/mental-health/fda-panel-promotes-misinformation-antidepressants-pregnancy-psychiatri-rcna220047?ref=autonomynews.co"><u>packed</u></a> with <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/07/the-fda-held-a-misinformation-fest-about-antidepressants-in-pregnancy/?ref=autonomynews.co"><u>misinformation</u></a> about SSRI use during pregnancy.</p>
<p><strong>Immigration and Customs Enforcement</strong> <a href="https://www.startribune.com/how-ice-labeled-a-minnesota-teen-an-unaccompanied-minor-and-lost-him/601578960?utm_source=gift"><u>apprehended</u></a> a Minneapolis teenager seeking <strong>asylum</strong> in the U.S. with his father. They declared him an “<strong>unaccompanied minor</strong>,” sent him to a Christian youth shelter in <strong>Michigan</strong>, and lost him for a week. The teen was driving alone when agents detained him and flew him to a shelter owned by <strong>Bethany Christian Services</strong>, one of the country’s largest adoption agencies known for its anti-abortion stance and <a href="https://rewirenewsgroup.com/2018/06/27/christian-group-fostering-migrant-kids-history-coercive-adoptions/?ref=autonomynews.co"><u>history</u></a> of <strong>coercive adoptions</strong>. It’s far from the only example of immigrant children being detained while their parents try to retrieve them but don’t have the correct forms of <strong>identification</strong>. Multiple families <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.280423/gov.uscourts.dcd.280423.48.0.pdf?ref=autonomynews.co"><u>are</u></a> <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/72069728/c-f-v-kennedy/?ref=autonomynews.co"><u>suing</u></a> the Trump administration over the paperwork rules. An <strong>Associated Press</strong> investigation from Trump’s first term <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/deported-parents-may-lose-kids-adoption-investigation-finds-n918261?ref=autonomynews.co"><u>uncovered</u></a> that <strong>migrant children</strong> are sometimes placed in the custody of U.S. families without their parents even being notified. If the parents are deported, they may lose their children to <strong>adoption</strong>.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/report/abortion-clinics-united-states-2024-2025?ref=autonomynews.co"><u>new report</u></a> from the <strong>Guttmacher Institute </strong>finds that the number of brick-and-mortar <strong>abortion clinics</strong> in the U.S. declined by about two percent from March 2024 to the end of 2025. However, according to researchers, this seemingly small decline “can mask churn” as significant numbers of clinics close in some areas, while new facilities open up in others. Some of the declines were noted in states thought to be <strong>abortion havens</strong>, including <strong>California</strong>, which lost two clinics; <strong>Illinois</strong>, which also lost two; and <strong>New York</strong>, which lost a whopping <em>eight</em> clinics. Trump administration moves like the Medicaid <strong>“defund”</strong> of large abortion providers are <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/18/health/abortion-clinic-closures-guttmacher?ref=autonomynews.co"><u>further straining clinics</u></a> even in states with the fewest abortion restrictions. (Remember, federal Medicaid dollars can only be used to pay for abortion in extremely limited circumstances due to the <strong>Hyde Amendment</strong>, so when abortion providers bill Medicaid it’s usually for services like <strong>birth control</strong>, <strong>cancer screening</strong>, and <strong>STI testing</strong>.)</p>
<p>Last week, <strong>Americans United for Life</strong> (AUL) sent a press release about a <a href="https://aul.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Defund-2026-Coalition-Letter.pdf?ref=autonomynews.co"><u>coalition letter</u></a> urging Congress to extend the one-year “defund” provision in the federal budget, making <strong>Planned Parenthood </strong>and some other large abortion providers ineligible to participate in <strong>Medicaid</strong>. The current “defund” provision expires in July. The letter asks Congressional Republicans to extend it for 10 years, which is what they originally proposed. Signatories on the letter are a who’s-who of anti-abortion groups, including <strong>Live Action</strong>, <strong>Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America</strong>, <strong>Heritage Action</strong>, and <strong>Family Research Council</strong>. AUL later said the “leading organization decided after the fact that the letter was to be delayed to early March.” Oops!</p>
<h2><strong>State news</strong></h2>
<p>A <strong>Texas</strong> appeals court <a href="https://www.houstonpress.com/news/attorneys-for-midwife-sued-by-paxton-say-wheres-the-evidence/?ref=autonomynews.co"><u>heard arguments</u></a> in the case of <strong>Maria Rojas</strong>, the <strong>midwife</strong> arrested last year and accused of violating the state’s <strong>abortion ban</strong> and practicing medicine without a license. Rojas is represented by the <strong>Center for Reproductive Rights</strong>, which says the state has <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/ip-law/paxton-offered-little-proof-of-abortion-by-midwife-court-says?ref=autonomynews.co"><u>yet to present any evidence</u></a> to back these allegations up. However, even though Rojas hasn’t been convicted of any crime, she was stripped of her midwife’s <strong>license</strong>, and a lower court issued an injunction that shut down multiple clinics where she provided care to a largely uninsured, Spanish-speaking population. Rojas’ legal team is <a href="https://www.click2houston.com/news/local/2026/02/19/texas-appeals-court-to-hear-case-against-houston-midwife-accused-under-abortion-ban/?ref=autonomynews.co"><u>asking the appellate court</u></a> to reverse this injunction while legal proceedings continue. It’s not known when the court will issue its ruling. Rojas is the first person to be charged with violating Texas’ criminal abortion ban, which is no coincidence: The first abortion bans in the U.S., enacted in the 19th century, were <a href="https://rewirenewsgroup.com/2023/02/07/its-no-surprise-the-ama-is-leaving-abortion-providers-twisting-in-the-wind/?ref=autonomynews.co"><u>designed by physicians</u></a> looking to put their biggest competitors—midwives—out of business.</p>
<p>Two<strong> Tennessee </strong>Republicans <a href="https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/politics/2026/02/20/tennessee-bill-death-penalty-women-abortion/88777975007/?ref=autonomynews.co"><u>want to classify</u></a> <strong>abortion</strong> as <strong>homicide</strong> and make it punishable by the death penalty—including for people who have abortions. They’re trying to do this by adding an amendment to <a href="https://wapp.capitol.tn.gov/apps/BillInfo/Default?BillNumber=HB0570&amp;ref=autonomynews.co"><u>House Bill 570/Senate Bill 738</u></a>, a bill related to the maintenance and upkeep of a <a href="https://vanderbiltpoliticalreview.com/12751/local/what-tennessees-monument-to-the-unborn-says-about-its-priorities/?ref=autonomynews.co"><u>planned</u></a> “monument to unborn children” on state capitol grounds. Neither that bill nor this amendment, have been voted on, but the <strong>Southern Baptist Convention</strong> says it endorses removing the exception for <strong>pregnant people</strong> that currently exists in the state’s abortion ban.</p>
<p><strong>Florida </strong>Republicans are <a href="https://floridapolitics.com/archives/779138-house-committee-oks-parental-rights-bill-requiring-teens-to-get-permission-for-std-treatment/?ref=autonomynews.co"><u>advancing a bill</u></a> that would ban health providers from prescribing or even giving teenagers information about <strong>contraceptives</strong> without written parental permission. HB 173 would also allow doctors to examine and diagnose teenagers with <strong>STIs</strong> <em>without</em> parental consent, but requires a parent’s permission for treatment. In fact, medical providers would be unable to prescribe any drug to a minor without a parent’s signoff. Republicans say this is about <strong>“parental rights,”</strong> while Democrats have pointed out that it will put kids in danger—for example, by requiring a teenager who’s being sexually abused to get permission for medical treatment from the person who might be abusing them.</p>
<p>An <strong>Idaho</strong> case illustrates the danger of expansive <strong>parental rights </strong>laws: The state <a href="https://www.autonomynews.co/new-york-texas-abortion-pill-showdown-rfk-coming-for-tylenol-and-more-september-8-news-roundup/#state-news"><u>requires</u></a> consent for practically every medical intervention for minors, and when teens in distress call the <strong>988 Suicide and Crisis Hotline</strong>, operators have to end the call because of where they live. One teen who tried to seek help is <a href="https://idahocapitalsun.com/2026/02/18/988-ended-his-call-now-an-idaho-teen-is-pushing-for-a-fix-to-states-parental-consent-law/?ref=autonomynews.co"><u>urging lawmakers</u></a> to add carveouts to the law, which is also affecting young people’s <a href="https://idahocapitalsun.com/2024/08/06/idahos-parental-consent-law-prohibits-minors-from-accessing-rape-kit-exams-without-parents/?ref=autonomynews.co"><u>access to</u></a> <strong>rape kits</strong>. Idaho also <a href="https://www.autonomynews.co/fda-drops-barriers-to-menopause-treatment-supreme-court-denies-kim-davis-november-10-news-roundup/#state-news"><u>quietly turned down</u></a> all $1.5 million of its annual <strong>Title X</strong> federal family planning funding to comply with the parental rights law. The federal program doesn’t require consent for contraception or other reproductive health services.</p>
<p>The <strong>Wyoming </strong>House passed HB 117, a bill that would introduce new, biased “informed consent” requirements for <strong>abortion. </strong>The bill will now be taken up by the Senate. House committees also <a href="https://www.wyomingpublicmedia.org/health/2026-02-17/wyoming-republicans-advance-bill-to-ban-abortion-when-theres-a-heartbeat?ref=autonomynews.co"><u>advanced</u></a> a <strong>six-week abortion ban</strong> known as <a href="https://wyoleg.gov/Legislation/2026/HB0126?ref=autonomynews.co"><u>HB 126</u></a>—despite the fact that this ban would <a href="https://www.autonomynews.co/wyoming-abortion-bans-permanently-blocked-south-carolina-fetal-personhood-bill-back-january-12-news-roundup/"><u>obviously conflict</u></a> with the Wyoming Supreme Court’s interpretation of the state constitution—and <a href="https://www.wyoleg.gov/Legislation/2026/HB0143?ref=autonomynews.co"><u>HB 143</u></a>, an <strong>Alliance Defending Freedom</strong>-<a href="https://cowboystatedaily.com/2026/02/18/wyoming-lawmakers-advance-bill-shielding-free-speech-of-medical-professionals/?ref=autonomynews.co"><u>backed bill</u></a> to “protect” healthcare providers who feel they need to “self-censor” about their opposition to things like <strong>gender-affirming care</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>Mississippi</strong> House <a href="https://www.mississippifreepress.org/mail-order-abortion-pill-ban-passes-mississippi-house-with-prison-time-for-providers-for-drug-trafficking/?ref=autonomynews.co"><u>passed</u></a> an anti-<strong>drug trafficking</strong> bill that was <a href="https://www.autonomynews.co/trump-detains-migrant-girls-texas-abortion-ban-february-16-news-roundup/#state-news"><u>amended</u></a> to include <strong>“abortion-inducing drugs</strong>.” If convicted, prescribers of these drugs could face one to 10 years in prison. The bill, H.B. 1613, passed, by a<a href="https://billstatus.ls.state.ms.us/2026/pdf/votes/house/0370010.pdf?ref=autonomynews.co"> <u>77-39</u></a> vote.</p>
<p>In <strong>Iowa</strong>, House Republicans <a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/2026/02/16/iowa-legislature-bill-banning-all-abortions-wont-advance/88661980007/?ref=autonomynews.co"><u>canceled a planned hearing</u></a> on House File 2332, a <strong>total abortion ban</strong>, because they didn’t have the votes. The state currently bans abortion at around six weeks of pregnancy.</p>
<h2><strong>Personhood watch</strong></h2>
<p>A <strong>Nevada</strong> woman <a href="https://www.jezebel.com/cop-who-got-a-woman-arrested-for-her-stillbirth-kept-the-fetal-remains?ref=autonomynews.co"><u>imprisoned</u></a> for a <strong>stillbirth</strong> under a 1911 law received a <a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/i-lost-a-lot-of-hope-nevada-pays-100k-to-woman-convicted-for-miscarriage-via-1911-law?ref=autonomynews.co"><u>$100,000 settlement</u></a> from the state after a court vacated her conviction due ineffective assistance of counsel. Nevada is the only state that explicitly <strong>criminalizes pregnant people</strong> for ending their pregnancies, and only after 24 weeks of pregnancy. Patience Rousseau was the only person ever convicted under the law following her 2018 stillbirth, and $100K is nowhere near enough to make up for that. A bill to <strong>repeal</strong> that law <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/194833/nevada-repeal-1911-abortion-ban?ref=autonomynews.co"><u>stalled in the legislature</u></a> last year in part due to opposition from reproductive rights groups who claimed it would interfere with messaging around a proposed <strong>ballot measure</strong> codifying a right to abortion until fetal viability. That amendment, Question 6, needs to pass a second time this fall to become law.</p>
<h2><strong>First Amendment watch</strong></h2>
<p>A federal judge <a href="https://www.boston.com/news/local-news/2026/02/19/anti-abortion-centers-lawsuit-mass-officials-dismissed/?ref=autonomynews.co"><u>dismissed</u></a> an anti-abortion <strong>crisis pregnancy center</strong>’s lawsuit against the state of <strong>Massachusetts</strong> over its <strong>public education campaign</strong> about CPCs and their deceptive tactics. In June 2024, the state <a href="https://www.wgbh.org/news/politics/2024-06-10/mass-officials-launch-information-campaign-warning-against-anti-abortion-centers?ref=autonomynews.co"><u>launched</u></a> a <a href="https://www.mass.gov/info-details/about-anti-abortion-centers?ref=autonomynews.co"><u>campaign</u></a> that, among other things, warned the public that CPC staff or volunteers may interpret pregnancy dating ultrasounds without the required medical training. A CPC called <strong>Your Options Medical</strong> sued the state and the Reproductive Equity Now Foundation, which worked on the campaign, claiming that they discriminated against the CPC based on its religious views and stifled its right to free speech. A judge <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mad.274138/gov.uscourts.mad.274138.90.0.pdf?ref=autonomynews.co"><u>disagreed</u></a>. Your Options says it will appeal the decision to the <strong>First Circuit Court of Appeals</strong>.</p>
<h2><strong>Assaults on queer people</strong></h2>
<p>The <strong>Bureau of Prisons</strong> has <a href="https://www.lawdork.com/p/trump-admin-new-bop-anti-trans-prison-policy?ref=autonomynews.co"><u>proposed a new policy</u></a> that would ban <strong>gender-affirming surgeries </strong>for <strong>trans people </strong>incarcerated in federal prisons, require them to “taper” off <strong>hormone therapy</strong>, and end <strong>social transition</strong> accommodations, such as gender-appropriate clothing. An earlier version of the policy, which would have banned gender-affirming care and accommodations wholesale, has been <a href="https://www.lawdork.com/p/class-injunction-trans-care-prisons?ref=autonomynews.co"><u>blocked</u></a> by a federal court for nearly a year.</p>
<p><strong>NYU Langone Health</strong> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/17/nyregion/nyu-hospital-transgender-youth.html?ref=autonomynews.co"><u>says</u></a> it will end <strong>youth gender-affirming care</strong>, citing the “current regulatory environment.” <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/nyc-parents-say-mount-sinai-has-cut-off-services-for-trans-kids-ahead-of-federal-rule?ref=autonomynews.co"><u>Parents say</u></a> <strong>Mount Sinai Health</strong> has done the same, though the health system has refused to answer questions about the change. The Trump administration has proposed, but not finalized, a rule to block <strong>Medicare</strong> and <strong>Medicaid</strong> funding to hospitals that offer this care.</p>
<p><strong>Texas </strong>Attorney General <strong>Ken Paxton</strong> is <a href="https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/news/releases/attorney-general-ken-paxton-sues-radical-company-selling-harmful-chest-binders-girls-transition-them?ref=autonomynews.co"><u>suing</u></a> <strong>New York</strong>-based retailer <strong>Lola Olivia </strong>for selling <strong>chest binders</strong> online.</p>

State officials say the law’s <a href="https://kansasreflector.com/2026/02/22/kansas-state-officials-begin-process-of-interpreting-poorly-drafted-bathroom-law/?ref=autonomynews.co"><u>vague language</u></a> will make it difficult to implement.</p>
<p><strong>Tennessee </strong>Republicans <a href="https://tennesseelookout.com/2026/02/12/tennessee-republicans-advance-bills-targeting-lgbtq-residents/?ref=autonomynews.co"><u>voted unanimously to advance</u></a> five <strong>anti-LGBTQ+</strong> bills, including one that would allow private individuals and organizations to refuse to recognize <strong>same-sex marriages</strong>; one that would ban <strong>Pride flags</strong> or other observances by state employees; another that would allow small businesses to ignore <strong>anti-discrimination protections</strong> for LGBTQ+ people in the workplace; an expansion of existing state law that bans <strong>public school employees</strong> from being required to respect students’ correct pronouns; and another that would bar health professionals from asking children about <strong>gender identity</strong> without a parent present.</p>

The ACLU <a href="https://www.jezebel.com/the-5-most-infuriating-takeaways-from-supreme-court-arguments-on-trans-kids-medical-care?ref=autonomynews.co"><u>warned</u></a> in late 2024 that the Supreme Court upholding bans on young people’s care could lead to bans for adults.</p>
<p><strong>Alliance Defending Freedom</strong> is <a href="https://adfmedia.org/press-release/xx-xy-athletics-christian-bookstore-continue-suits-against-colorado-for-silencing-their-views-on-biological-reality/?ref=autonomynews.co"><u>suing</u></a> the state of <strong>Colorado</strong> on behalf of a Christian bookstore and an <strong>anti-trans</strong> athletic apparel company who argue that the state’s anti-discrimination law—which merely requires businesses to address people the way they want to be addressed—infringes on “their ability to speak truthfully about the biological differences between men and women.” However, after a hearing last week, a federal magistrate judge <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/70392086/committee-of-five-inc-v-sullivan/?ref=autonomynews.co"><u>recommended</u></a> that ADF’s motion for a preliminary injunction blocking enforcement of the law be denied.</p>
<h2><strong>Extremism</strong></h2>
<p>The <em>San Francisco Chronicle</em> reports that anti-abortion legal activist <strong>Jonathan Mitchell</strong> found <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/california/article/jonathan-mitchell-abortion-ban-california-21244133.php?ref=autonomynews.co"><u>yet another</u></a> <strong>male abuser</strong> to challenge access to <strong>abortion pills</strong>. His client <strong>Jerry Rodriguez</strong> is a <strong>Texas</strong> man who <a href="https://www.autonomynews.co/planned-parenthood-defund-blocked-but-11-clinics-close-july-28-news-roundup/#personhood-watch"><u>filed</u></a> a July 2025 lawsuit against a <strong>California</strong> physician for prescribing medication abortion to his girlfriend. The lawsuit is an attempt to <a href="https://www.autonomynews.co/an-onslaught-of-lawsuits-and-state-legislation-february-9-news-roundup/#state-news"><u>take down</u></a> the state’s “<strong>shield law</strong>,” which protects clinicians who prescribe abortion pills across state lines. The <em>Chronicle</em> reports that Rodriguez was convicted of <strong>assaulting</strong> a woman in 2006 and <strong>threatening to kill</strong> another in 2009. The woman Rodriguez claims used the abortion pills told police in October 2024 that he <strong>punched</strong> and <strong>choked</strong> her and had “strangled her 8 times” over the previous five months. In 2023, Mitchell represented another Texas man named <strong>Marcus Silva</strong> who sued three of his estranged wife’s friends for allegedly helping her access abortion pills. Silva was verbally and emotionally abusive and <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/texan-suing-abortion-promised-drop-lawsuit-sex-1234839569/?ref=autonomynews.co"><u>threatened to release</u></a> sex tapes of his wife unless she did his laundry and said he’d drop the case if she had sex with him. The parties <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2024/10/11/texas-abortion-assistance-lawsuit-dropped/?ref=autonomynews.co"><u>settled</u></a> the case days before it was set to go to trial.</p>
