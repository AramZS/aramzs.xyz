(Matt McClain/The Washington Post)</figcaption></figure><p>A federal judge in Virginia rejected the Justice Department’s request to search through a Washington Post reporter’s electronic devices as part of a national security leak investigation, ruling that the court would instead be responsible for conducting the search.</p><p>The <a href="https://washingtonpost.com/documents/820e7a03-efb5-4c3c-a02b-d9b5a48ef737.pdf" target="_blank">Tuesday ruling</a> suggested that Magistrate Judge William Porter did not trust the government to conduct a narrow search of the devices and feared that such an examination could risk exposing more than 1,000 of the reporter’s government sources to the Justice Department.</p><p class="rw-outer-content"><span>Some content could not be imported from the original document.</span> <a href="https://washingtonpost.com/national-security/2026/02/24/washington-post-reporter-search/">View content ↗ </a></p><p>“Given the documented reporting on government leak investigations and the government’s well chronicled efforts to stop them, allowing the government’s filter team to search a reporter’s work product — most of which consists of unrelated information from confidential sources — is the equivalent of leaving the government’s fox in charge of the Washington Post’s henhouse,” Porter wrote.</p><p>Porter also sharply criticized prosecutors for not briefing him in their search warrant application on a federal law that protects reporters against searches in many situations: the Privacy Protection Act of 1980. Their failure to inform him about the law before he approved the warrant in the case “has seriously undermined the Court’s confidence in the government’s disclosures in this proceeding,” he wrote.</p><p>On Jan. 14, the federal government executed an unprecedented search of Post reporter Hannah Natanson’s home in Virginia. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2026/01/14/washington-post-reporter-search/" target="_blank">Federal agents</a> seized a phone, two laptops, a recorder, a portable hard drive and a Garmin watch. Law enforcement officials said the search was part of their investigation into government contractor Aurelio Perez-Lugones, a systems administrator with a top-secret clearance who was indicted in Maryland last month on charges of unlawfully obtaining and sharing classified materials.</p><p>Porter <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2026/02/20/washington-post-reporter-search-fbi/" target="_blank">held a hearing in an Alexandria courthouse Friday</a> to determine whether the government should be permitted to search through the devices seized from Natanson — or whether the government must return those devices to Natanson without an extensive search.</p><p>The ruling Tuesday afternoon is a victory for The Post and Natanson, who said that allowing the government to search through her phone would risk the identities of her sources and could have a chilling effect on future sources who wish to speak to reporters.</p><p><i>This is a developing story and will be updated.</i></p></body></html>
