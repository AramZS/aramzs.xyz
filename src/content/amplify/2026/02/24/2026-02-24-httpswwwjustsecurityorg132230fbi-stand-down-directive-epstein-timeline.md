<p>Just five days after Jeffrey Epstein’s arrest in the summer of 2019, federal authorities “directed” the New York Police Department to “stand down” its investigations related to Epstein, new documents released by the Department of Justice show. The directive applied to NYPD’s Special Victims Unit — the group specially trained and equipped to handle sex crimes and child abuse cases. At the time, the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office (DANY) had an ongoing investigation involving Epstein’s victims, the documents reveal, but the FBI assumed that would come to a halt as well following the Bureau’s directive.</p>
<p>These revelations are just part of the chronology below, which spans 1996-2025. The timeline amounts to the most comprehensive record to date of the publicly available information on New York law enforcement authorities’ action and inaction with regard to Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell and other potential co-conspirators. It is a long record of institutional failures though with some successes (including DANY’s more recent pursuits with at least one of the alleged co-conspirators). The timeline is provided for public education, especially given that New York was an epicenter of Epstein’s vast criminal conspiracy.</p>
<p>Notably, last week, the Office of New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez also revealed that his state’s “investigation was closed in 2019 at the request of the U.S Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York.” The revelation came alongside Attorney General Raúl Torrez ordering the criminal investigation to now be “reopened.”</p>

<h2><strong>Timeline: New York Law Enforcement and Epstein Investigations</strong></h2>
<p><strong>August 29, 1996: Maria Farmer reports Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell to NYPD</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“On August 29, 1996, [Maria Farmer] reported Epstein and Maxwell to law enforcement. Initially, Maria reported Epstein’s crimes to the New York Police Department’s Sixth Precinct (“NYPD”). 114. Maria disclosed to the NYPD that Epstein and Maxwell had sexually abused her and that Epstein and Maxwell, together with others, were committing multiple ongoing illegal sex abuse crimes, including crimes against minors and vulnerable young women, child pornography crimes, and possible crimes against her minor siblings.<br/> …</p> <p>The NYPD explained that they could only address the local fire threats and that she needed to report her additional allegations to the FBI. They gave her the FBI’s telephone contact information ….”</p></blockquote>

<p>Context: The FBI did not open an investigation into Epstein <a href="https://context-cdn.washingtonpost.com/notes/prod/default/documents/1c1f6649-226e-4afa-953e-826dee8de3b5/note/49b577fa-6ad8-415d-8efc-c553423af314.#page=42">until</a> May 23, 2006.</p>
<p><strong>On June 30, 2008: Epstein pleads guilty in Florida state court – to one count of state felony solicitation of prostitution and one count of procurement of a minor to engage in prostitution.</strong></p>
<p><strong>From 2008-2018: Period of inaction despite allegations of Epstein and co-conspirators’ crimes in court cases and news reports</strong></p>
<p>New York law enforcement authorities should have been alerted to explosive revelations of a wider criminal conspiracy, including the role of Ghislaine Maxwell, in news reports and several civil lawsuits filed in the Southern District of New York and the Southern District of Florida in the months and years following Epstein’s 2008 plea.</p>
<p>Source: Court cases cited in <a href="https://www.justsecurity.org/119137/timeline-jeffrey-epstein-ghislaine-maxwell/#post-119137-_x1e6b5l0c9r3">No. 15</a> in prior Timeline of federal law enforcement failures.</p>
<p><strong>January 18, 2011: Office of Manhattan DA Cyrus Vance Jr. attempts to downgrade Epstein’s sex offender status to low risk</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Judge Pickholz: “I have to tell you, I am a little overwhelmed because I have never seen the prosecutor’s office do anything like this.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Summary and context</strong>: Following his brief period of incarceration in Florida, Epstein returned to his homes including in New York. State Supreme Court Justice Ruth Pickholz was shocked by the Manhattan DA prosecutors’ request to reduce Epstein’s sex offender’s status in New York to the lowest possible level. As the New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/09/nyregion/cyrus-vance-epstein.html">reported</a>, the low-level classification “would have limited the personal information available to the public, and would have kept him from being listed on a registry of sex offenders for life.” It was especially surprising because the State Board of Examiners of Sex Offenders had already <a href="https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/soma-board-recommendation-epstein-EFTA00095656.pdf">recommended</a> the highest classification of Level 3. Court records <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/09/nyregion/cyrus-vance-epstein.html">reportedly</a> showed the Board’s risk assessment of Epstein was “solidly above” the threshold for Level 3. Following Justice Pickholz’s rebuke, Cy Vance submitted a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00792500.pdf">brief</a> in August 2011 asking the appellate court to uphold Justice Pickholz’s level 3 determination. Vance’s communications director Danny Frost would later issue a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/09/us/jeffrey-epstein-sex-offender">statement</a> saying, “D.A. Vance was not made aware that the Manhattan D.A.’s Office even had this SORA [Sex Offender Registration Act] matter, or any matter involving Jeffrey Epstein, until well after the hearing occurred and only when the office corrected its legal error on appeal.”</p>
<p>Important note: There is a <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jeffrey-epstein-nypd-says-it-wasnt-required-to-monitor-sex-offender-registration/">dispute</a> whether Epstein was required by the court, as a Level 3 sex offender, to check in every 90 days with NYPD. Epstein did not do so. In July 2019, NYPD publicly <a href="https://x.com/NYPDChiefOfDept/status/1149326440812482562">defended</a> its decision not to require Epstein to make those check-ins on the ground that Epstein changed his residence to the Virgin Islands before his first legally mandated check-in. Documents released in the DOJ files indicate Epstein’s attorneys had obtained that view from NYPD, and their letters to various NYPD authorities restated that understanding in <a href="https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00584529.pdf">undated</a> (likely 2010), <a href="https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00728347.pdf">2010</a>, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01733848.pdf">2010</a> and <a href="https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01100102.pdf">2015</a>. Epstein’s daily calendar and schedules, which are now public, would indicate if he stayed in New York for longer than 9 days at a time, which this understanding (to not perform the regular check-ins) required.</p>

<p><strong>May 7-8, 2012: Epstein and one of his victims-assistants discuss NYPD contacting her</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>[Redacted]: “Is something going on that I should know about? I have NYPD detectives looking me up and contacting me on social networks. Nothing specific, I’m just suspicious….”</p> <p>Epstein: “nohting[sic] i know about at all. many diplomats coming to see me. could be reasons. nothing sex related.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Summary and context</strong>: A victim who became an assistant to Epstein (her identity since redacted) emailed Epstein reporting that NYPD detectives were researching and contacting her. The next day, Epstein responded that it did not necessarily mean the NYPD was onto him for sex-related matters.</p>

<p><strong>December 6, 2018: The FBI opens a case on Epstein with SDNY, aided by NYPD/FBI Child Exploitation Human Trafficking Task Force</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“On 12/06/2018, FBI NY initiated a case after Southern District of New York (SDNY) contacted FBI NY regarding several victims that had been sexually abused by Jeffrey Epstein in the mid 2000’s.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Likely before July 6, 2019: NYPD travels to New Mexico to interview Epstein survivor</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“We had some issues prior to and post arrest of Epstein with possible rumors of DANY having a case on him. We eventually found out (I think after the arrest was made) that NYPD special victims did fly to New Mexico to interview an Epstein Victim (Farmer).”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Summary and context</strong>: In a January 28-29, 2020 email exchange, apparently FBI officials discuss whether DANY has had its own Epstein investigation.</p>
<p><strong>July 6, 2019: Epstein arrested – resulting from FBI, DOJ and NYPD investigation </strong></p>
<p>A joint press conference is held by SDNY, FBI, and NYPD. In an SDNY press <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/jeffrey-epstein-charged-manhattan-federal-court-sex-trafficking-minors">statement</a>, “[SDNY US Attorney] Berman praised the outstanding investigative work of the FBI and the NYPD.” William Sweeney, the head of the FBI NY Field Office, <a href="https://transcripts.cnn.com/show/ath/date/2019-07-08/segment/01">said</a>: “Our partnership with the NYPD on this case and so many others has been phenomenal. … Last but not least, I want to extend my thanks to the NYPD child exploitation and human trafficking task force.”</p>
<p><strong>July 10-11, 2019: The “stand down” directive to NY law enforcement authorities; DANY investigation was proceeding</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>July 10: “Here’s another fire: <strong>DANY is proceeding with their investigation and already reached out to nbc news victim</strong> to arrange an interview. I’m not sure what the point is given both their double jeopardy and SOL [Statute of Limitations] issues. Let’s discuss outreach to them.”</p> <p>July 11: “<strong>FBI reached out to NYPD leadership already and they were told that SVU [Special Victims Unit] has been directed to stand down and that all Epstein stuff needs to go to and through us</strong>. DANY could still try to go forward with their own investigators, so I think it is worth a call over.” (emphasis added)</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Summary and context</strong>: In apparent email exchanges including U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman, federal officials email colleagues to flag that DANY has its own parallel investigation into Epstein and that DANY recently contacted a victim for an interview, raising concerns about overlapping jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Note 1: An Epstein survivor was <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/new-jeffrey-epstein-accuser-he-raped-me-when-i-was-n1028011">interviewed</a> by NBC’s Savannah Guthrie on July 10, 2019. That same day she submitted a New York State court <a href="https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/fbem/DocumentDisplayServlet?documentId=f0TLN3SKZ/mR_PLUS_Xfj5Dbefw==&amp;system=prod">filing</a> asking to obtain information from Epstein of a recruiter who allegedly worked with him in luring her. On August 14, 2019, she filed a <a href="https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/nyscef/ViewDocument?docIndex=CwuhhjSSjUl30efulsBtuA==">lawsuit</a> in New York State court against Ghislaine Maxwell, three unnamed Epstein assistants, and the Epstein estate alleging that Epstein sexually assaulted her in his New York City townhouse when she was 14 and 15 years old. Around that time, the survivor’s lawyer <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/crime-courts/jeffrey-epstein-accuser-jennifer-araoz-sues-ghislaine-maxwell-3-other-n1041901">confirmed</a> to NBC News that she had been in contact with DANY. In October 2019, the survivor <a href="https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/nyscef/ViewDocument?docIndex=GgZneJVHbXk/GIk8Cn4lLA==">amended</a> her complaint to add Lesley Groff, Cimberly Espinosa, and several corporate entities (see court filing in <a href="https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/nyscef/ViewDocument?docIndex=bCgO7xqtO_PLUS_d_PLUS_6YioQmUy6A==">response</a> by Groff’s attorney).</p>

<p><strong>Possibly October 2019: DANY begins looking into sexual assault allegations against Leonard Black</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“The Manhattan District Attorney’s office began looking into allegations against Leon Black.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Summary and context:</strong> A memo released by the Department of Justice provides a timeline of the Epstein investigation. This reference to DANY is made following a statement that “In October 2019, an adult victim was interviewed and provided information related to Epstein directing her to massage two other individuals, <strong>Leon Black and Jes Staley</strong>” (emphasis added) with details of alleged sexual abuse. The document may be an FBI Case Initiation Summary. The date of the start of the investigation is not certain from the memo which itself was written sometime after June 28, 2022.</p>
<p>Note: For DANY’s investigation of Leon Black, see Jacob Shamsian and Madeline Berg, Epstein files show prosecutors investigated Leon Black sexual abuse allegations — but he wasn’t charged, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/leon-black-epstein-files-sexual-assault-claims-investigate-prosecutors-2026-2">Business Insider</a>, Feb. 10, 2026.</p>

<p><strong>August 17-19, 2019: NYPD receives new tip/allegation in Epstein case</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“Not sure if you saw this LER that came in. It mentioned Jeffrey Epstein. Can you please take a look at it?”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Summary and context:</strong> An NYPD detective from Vice Enforcement forwards a Law Enforcement Report (LER 2205) from the NYPD Special Victims Division IRT/LER Unit. It appears to be sent to the NYPD/FBI Child Exploitation and Human Trafficking Task Force.</p>
<p><strong>January 28-29, 2020: FBI/federal agents discuss “stand down” directive</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“After our arrest was public some phone calls were made amongst <strong>NYPD brass and I’m pretty sure there[sic] investigation was closed and differed[sic] to us</strong>. I’m not totally sure of DANY’s involvement into that investigation or if they ever stopped. Our assumption was obviously that they closed anything they had after his death.</p> <p>It may be an issue though if DANY somehow was continuing an investigation into Price Andrew or his best friend Maxwell. This is something we may want to figure out I’m hoping they are continuing to differ[sic] this case to us but we may not know without making a few inquiries.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Summary and context</strong>: An FBI email chain discusses the history of NYPD/DANY Epstein investigations, that the NYPD investigation was closed and deferred to the FBI, that federal authorities’ assumption was DANY also closed its investigation, but not clear that they did. The above quote follows in response to an FBI official in the New York Office writing, “I am not aware of any DANY investigation on Epstein.”</p>
<p>Note: See July 10-11, 2019 entry for additional information on the stand down directive.</p>
<p><strong>July 2, 2020: Maxwell arrested – resulting from FBI, DOJ and NYPD investigation </strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“Dermot Shea, Commissioner of the New York City Police Department (‘NYPD’), announced that GHISLANE MAXWELL was arrested this morning.<br/> …<br/> [SDNY Acting US Attorney] Strauss praised the outstanding investigative work of the FBI and the NYPD.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>November 9, 2020:</strong> <strong>NYPD receives new tip/allegation in Epstein/Maxwell case</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“She did not report this to anyone until this year. [Redacted] has filed a report with the NYPD regarding the assault. This occurred in 1992.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Summary and context</strong>: FBI Intake records a victim calling the National Threat Operations Center to report her 1992 assault by Epstein/Maxwell in NYC.</p>

<p><strong>February 25-March 10, 2021: Alleged lack of followup by NYPD with Epstein victim<br/>
</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Feb. 25: “She said she had been in touch with an NYPD detective but had not heard back in some time. … I advised that someone would follow up with her, hopefully in the next week or so.”</p> <p>Mar. 10: “Just FYI, got another call from Ms. [Redacted] this afternoon, looking for a follow-up.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Summary and context</strong>: An SDNY AUSA records a call from an Epstein victim who reports she had been in contact with an NYPD detective regarding her case but had not heard back.</p>

<p><strong>October 29, 2021: DANY investigation of sexual assault allegations against Leon Black</strong></p>
<blockquote><p> “ADA [redacted] &amp; I are from the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office and we are investigating allegations of sexual abuse against Leon Black.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Summary and context</strong>: DANY Assistant District Attorneys contact SDNY to apparently introduce their investigation into sexual abuse allegations against Leon Black connected to the Epstein matter.</p>

<p><strong>January 21, 2022: DANY investigation of sexual assault allegations against Leon Black continues</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“[O]ur office is conducting an investigation into sexual assault allegations by [redacted] against Mr. Black.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Summary and context</strong>: DANY Assistant District Attorney emails SDNY again, reconfirming the ongoing DANY investigation into Leon Black sexual assault allegations and checking on SDNY’s progress post-Maxwell trial. The email also says. “When we last spoke you had indicated that your office was pretty busy with the Maxwell trial and did not have much of an update regarding an investigation involving [redacted].” (The latter suggests another individual under investigation.)</p>
<p>Note-1: SDNY replies: “We don’t have any current plans to interview [redacted] again.If you are still pursuing an investigation encompassing both victims, we are not likely to open an other investigation. If anything changes or my understanding is incorrect, please let me know.”</p>

<p><strong>August 10, 2022: “Jane Doe” speaks with DANY’s Sex Crimes Unit apparently about Jes Staley</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“[Jane Doe, the plaintiff in this litigation] to Manhattan District Attorney’s Office Deputy Chief of the Sex Crimes Unit, Vanessa Puzio, on August 10, 2022″</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Summary and context</strong>: The information comes to light due to a subpoena by JPMorgan. The subpoena requests: “Any statements, oral or written, or records of statements, provided by any individual identifying <strong>James ‘Jes’ Staley</strong> as an alleged witness or an alleged perpetrator of any sexual assault, sexual abuse, or other sex-related crime” (emphasis added). In November 2022, Jane Doe had <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.590048/gov.uscourts.nysd.590048.1.0_4.pdf">sued</a> JPMorgan Chase for the alleged misconduct of Staley.</p>
<p>Note: See March 11, 2025 entry below for more information about Staley, including his admission to sexual intercouse with Epstein assistant.</p>
<p>Document: Federal court <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.590048/gov.uscourts.nysd.590048.157.0.pdf">order</a> approving the subpoena.</p>
<p><strong>February 28, 2023: New cooperating witness in DANY Leon Black sexual assault investigation</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“We have a new CW who has come forward and alleged sexual abuse by Leon Black. This CW was trafficked by Maxwell and Epstein, and we are wondering whether [redacted] name has come across your desk in the course of your investigation.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Summary and context</strong>: DANY contacts SDNY to report a new cooperating witness. They set up a time to speak by phone.</p>
<p>Document: <a href="https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/EFTA00156644-1.pdf">EFTA00156644</a></p>
<p><strong>June 2-28, 2023: Details of DANY’s Leon Black/Jes Staley sexual assault investigation</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“[Redacted] spoke with DANY in January in 2023 … They were considering civil lawsuit or being involved in the Epstein compensation fund. But wanted DANY to look at allegations against Black”</p> <p>“AW/ DANY do not doubt her allegations against JE and LB</p> <p>O They believe she was also abused by <strong>Staley</strong><br/> O They have not found any independent corroboration”</p> </blockquote>
<p><strong>Summary and context</strong>: An SDNY “memo to file” of a call with DANY includes details of a DANY investigation involving a victim allegedly trafficked by Maxwell and Epstein and allegedly assaulted by Leon Black. The victim’s attorneys appear to be Jeanne Christensen and Adam Horowitz. The memo includes references to DANY issuing a subpoena, attempting to obtain phone records, obtaining medical records, CLEAR records corroborating the identity of an Epstein assistant; “DANY didn’t push on Mary [the alleged assistant] because they didn’t have jurisdiction.”</p>
<p>Note 1: As referenced above, for SDNY and DANY’s investigation of Leon Black, see Jacob Shamsian and Madeline Berg, Epstein files show prosecutors investigated Leon Black sexual abuse allegations — but he wasn’t charged, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/leon-black-epstein-files-sexual-assault-claims-investigate-prosecutors-2026-2">Business Insider</a>, Feb. 10, 2026 (identifying 2022 <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23320523-cheri-pierson-v-leon-black/">lawsuit</a> mirroring the above allegations and discussing allegations of three other women).</p>
<p>Note 2: A May 30, 2024 <a href="https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731724.pdf">email</a> released by the Department of Justice indicates that Bradley Ewards, an attorney for other victims, opposed including the woman in a class action settlement award and cast doubt on her allegations; the email also indicates a federal judge expressed reluctance to include her in the class action award due to lack of corroboration.</p>
<p>Note 3: See March 11, 2025 entry below for more information about Staley, including his admission to sexual intercouse with an Epstein “assistant.”</p>
<p><strong>June 9, 2023: Reported/possible limitations of DANY Black investigation and low likelihood of charges </strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“[T]his is the victim DANY called about few months ago<br/> …<br/> DANY is only looking into one incident of sexual assault in NYC in 2001 by Black<br/> Any other conduct (and targets) would be outside the contours of their investigation<br/> …<br/> They find her credible in part of the similarity in the sexual assault … They are trying to see if any information as to that specific conduct could have become known to the victim</p> <p>Charges seem unlikely but they are still investigating.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Context</strong>: The summaries are in an apparently internal SDNY email, dated June 9, 2023, which provides “call notes” of a conversation with DANY about the “Leon Black DANY Investigation.” It separately refers to “DANY closed as to them,” which may be other potential victims in the Leon Black investigation.</p>

<p><strong>March 11, 2025: Jes Staley admits before U.K. court to having sexual intercourse with Epstein assistant<br/>
</strong></p>
<p>The new DOJ releases of Epstein files contain <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/feb/05/jes-staley-barclays-rape-allegation-us-prosecutors-epstein">additional allegations</a> about Staley, including in an 86-page confidential SDNY memorandum entitled, “Investigation into Potential Co-Conspirators of Jeffrey Epstein,” which is dated December 19, 2019 (<a href="https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/EFTA02731082.pdf">EFTA02731082</a>).</p>
<p>There are also more recent developments. On March 11, 2025, in court proceedings before the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority, FCA’s lawyer Leigh-Ann Mulcahy KC <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/mar/12/prince-andrew-was-told-epstein-saw-staley-as-close-friend-court-hears">reportedly</a> handed Staley documents, which were not available to the public, before asking:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Do you accept that you had sexual intercourse with a woman at Mr Epstein’s brother’s apartment?”</p> <p>Staley replied: “Yes.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Staley <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/13/business/jes-staley-slept-with-epstein-assistant-intl">reportedly</a> told the court, “she was part of his staff as I recall,” that Epstein <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/03/13/business/jes-staley-slept-with-epstein-assistant-intl">introduced</a> him to the woman. He <a href="https://www.wsj.com/finance/barclays-former-ceo-jes-staley-is-having-an-embarrassing-week-jeffrey-epstein-0db12a04?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=ASWzDAgkWpWzWTPfzirNvJIEUDWW4w9d1XtFyTIwHhrS-66-yu12oPAu998FyxQkBE4%3D&amp;gaa_ts=688f9ddd&amp;gaa_sig=rhyEfPRSHcy5cqkKizId7cjQYcsjjqDWGbDblohwuwUO_QwYhmYi_VY1xFMmupDojHmPR64HCeg_cwCHdJDmQQ%3D%3D">claimed</a> that he didn’t think Epstein knew they had sex, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/mar/12/prince-andrew-was-told-epstein-saw-staley-as-close-friend-court-hears">that</a> it was “consensual,” and that it was “one encounter.” He <a href="https://www.wsj.com/finance/barclays-former-ceo-jes-staley-is-having-an-embarrassing-week-jeffrey-epstein-0db12a04?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=ASWzDAgkWpWzWTPfzirNvJIEUDWW4w9d1XtFyTIwHhrS-66-yu12oPAu998FyxQkBE4%3D&amp;gaa_ts=688f9ddd&amp;gaa_sig=rhyEfPRSHcy5cqkKizId7cjQYcsjjqDWGbDblohwuwUO_QwYhmYi_VY1xFMmupDojHmPR64HCeg_cwCHdJDmQQ%3D%3D">said</a>, “we had, much to my embarrassment today, we had one encounter.”</p>
<p>Additional information has come to light since 2019 through civil litigation. In April 2023, the Government of the U.S. Virgin Islands’ <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.591653/gov.uscourts.nysd.591653.119.0.pdf">complaint</a> against Staley and JP Morgan stated: “Staley corresponded with Epstein while Epstein was incarcerated and visited Epstein’s Virgin Islands residence on multiple occasions.” The Wall Street Journal <a href="http://wsj.com/finance/barclays-former-ceo-jes-staley-is-having-an-embarrassing-week-jeffrey-epstein-0db12a04?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=ASWzDAgkWpWzWTPfzirNvJIEUDWW4w9d1XtFyTIwHhrS-66-yu12oPAu998FyxQkBE4%3D&amp;gaa_ts=688f9ddd&amp;gaa_sig=rhyEfPRSHcy5cqkKizId7cjQYcsjjqDWGbDblohwuwUO_QwYhmYi_VY1xFMmupDojHmPR64HCeg_cwCHdJDmQQ%3D%3D">reported</a> on one exchange: “‘Free and home,’ Epstein emailed four people, including Staley, on his release from jail the next year. ‘I toast your courage!!!!!’ Staley responded.” The U.S. Virgin Islands’s court filing also states:</p>
<blockquote><p>54. On December 30, 2008, … Staley replied that he would instead make arrangements to visit Epstein in Palm Beach in early January. On January 8, 2009—around the time of Staley’s scheduled visit to Palm Beach—Epstein wired $2,000 from his JP Morgan account to a woman with an Eastern European surname.</p> <p>55. Between August 27 and 29, 2009, Staley communicated via email to Epstein that he would be in London in a week. Epstein inquired whether Staley would need anything while in London, and Staley replied, “Yep.” On August 31, 2009, Epstein wired $3,000 from his JP Morgan account to the same Eastern European woman Epstein paid in January 2009.<br/> …<br/> 58. [On Dec. 5, 2009], Epstein wrote to Staley, “you were with Larry, and I had to put up with . . .” and attached a picture of a young woman (shown below). Staley quipped, “don’t tell me a French wine.” Epstein replied, “always thoughts of alcohol.”</p> <p>59. On December 20, 2009, Epstein sent an email to Staley that was blank except for a picture of a young woman.<br/> …<br/> 61. In July 2010, Staley sent an email to Epstein, saying: “Maybe they’re tracking u? That was fun. Say hi to Snow White.” Epstein responded: “[W]hat character would you like next?” When Staley said “Beauty and the Beast”, Epstein replied: “well one side is available.”</p></blockquote>
