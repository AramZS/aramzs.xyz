<p>Tourette’s activist <a data-tag="john-davidson" href="https://variety.com/t/john-davidson/">John Davidson</a>, who inadvertently <a href="https://variety.com/2026/film/awards/alan-cumming-john-davidson-i-swear-outbursts-1236669691/">shouted the N-word during the BAFTA Film Awards</a> on Sunday night, has released a statement after widespread backlash.</p>
<p>“I wanted to thank BAFTA and everyone involved in the awards last night for their support and understanding and inviting me to attend the broadcast. I appreciated the announcement to the auditorium in advance of the recording, warning everyone that my tics are involuntary and are not a reflection of my personal beliefs,” Davidson said. “I was heartened by the round of applause that followed this announcement and felt welcomed and understood in an environment that would normally be impossible for me. In addition to the announcement by Alan Cumming, the BBC and BAFTA, I can only add that I am, and always have been deeply mortified if anyone considers my involuntary tics to be intentional or to carry any meaning.”</p>

<p>He added: “I was in attendance to celebrate the film of my life, ‘<a data-tag="i-swear" href="https://variety.com/t/i-swear/">I Swear</a>,’ which more than any film or TV documentary, explains the origins, condition, traits and manifestations of Tourette Syndrome. I have spent my life trying to support and empower the Tourette’s community and to teach empathy, kindness and understanding from others and I will continue to do so. I chose to leave the auditorium early into the ceremony as I was aware of the distress my tics were causing.”</p>
<p>Davidson, who first began experiencing tics and uncontrollable outbursts involving cursing at the age of 12, was a guest at the ceremony after a film about his life, “I Swear,” was nominated for five awards.</p>
<p>In the movie, “Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power” star Robert Aramayo plays Davidson as he is diagnosed with the syndrome. Aramayo beat out Hollywood stars including Leonardo DiCaprio and Ethan Hawke to take home the leading man statue for his performance. The film, which was nominated in five categories, also won an award for casting.</p>
<p>Davidson made a number of outbursts during the first half of the ceremony, including shouting “shout the fuck up” at BAFTA chair Sara Putt. When Michael B, Jordan and Delroy Lindo took to the stage to present the best visual effects award to “Avatar: Fire and Ash” he was also heard shouting the N-word.</p>
<p>“Sinners” production designer, Hannah Beachler, who was also nominated for a BAFTA, later posted on X that “it happened 3 times that night and one of the three times was directed at myself on the way to dinner after the show.”</p>
<p>She added: “I know we must handle this with grace and continue to push through. But what made the situation worse was the throw away apology of ‘if you were offended’ at the end of the show.”<br/>
Before the ceremony began a floor manager introduced Davidson to the audience and warned them they may hear “some involuntary noises or movements.” Host Alan Cumming also twice interrupted proceedings to address Davidson’s outbursts, once to thank the audience, which include William and Kate, the Prince and Princess of Wales, for their understanding and the second time to apologize “if you are offended tonight.”</p>
<p>Despite the show being aired with a two hour time delay on BBC One in the U.K., the n-word was not censored or edited from the broadcast. The uncensored broadcast also remained available on the BBC’s streaming platform iPlayer until midday on Monday <a href="https://variety.com/2026/tv/news/bbc-removes-baftas-iplayer-n-word-broadcast-1236670091/">when the broadcaster pulled it</a>. It was also audible on the U.S. broadcast which went out on E! The BBC said in a statement: “Some viewers may have heard strong and offensive language during the <a data-tag="bafta-film-awards" href="https://variety.com/t/bafta-film-awards/">BAFTA Film Awards</a>. This arose from involuntary verbal tics associated with Tourette syndrome, and as explained during the ceremony it was not intentional. We apologize that this was not edited out prior to broadcast and it will now be removed from the version on BBC iPlayer.”</p>
