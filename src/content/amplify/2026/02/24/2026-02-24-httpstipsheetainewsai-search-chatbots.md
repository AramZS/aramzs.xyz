<p>For many publishers it represents the loss of search referral traffic and the onslaught of AI bots – and that’s just for starters. They’re not alone. Advertisers have similar concerns as Digiday’s Sam Bradley found out.</p>
<p>Labeling Google’s “AI Overviews” and “AI Mode” a zero-click search “cul-de-sac” where users visit but never advance any further, Bradley discovered that advertiser “organic search” traffic referrals had been negatively impacted by 12%, according to data from Wpromote.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the news isn’t all bad. Bradley reported:</p>
<figure data-id="524dacdf-fbab-4ed8-9b89-bc47415ea7f4" data-type="blockquoteFigure" data-variant="2"><blockquote> <p data-id="5747f9c8-df18-4254-badf-1f049acf345f">“But there’s another ‘general trend’ at play that’s somewhat more promising, according to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/charliemarchant/">Charlie Marchant</a>, CEO of SEO firm ExposureNinja. Marketers across categories are finding that when search traffic falls, sales or conversions are typically holding steady. And what referral traffic they’re able to track from the likes of ChatGPT appears to lead to higher rates of conversions. It’s a finding echoed during earnings calls this month.”</p> </blockquote></figure>

<p>In the latest episode of Andrew Faris’ eponymous performance marketing podcast, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/theconnormacdonald/">Connor MacDonald</a>, CMO of online retailer <a href="https://ridge.com/">Ridge</a>, was the guest.</p>
<p>Ridge specializes in wallets, rings and other accessories for men with, reportedly, “nine-figure” revenue driven almost entirely online.</p>
<p>As a CMO at the front lines of direct-to-consumer retail trends, Mr. MacDonald’s observations are also rooted in years of using Meta’s AI-enabled ad platform (he started at Ridge in 2017).</p>
<p>Here’s a selection of his insights from the podcast:</p>
<ul> <li data-id="5dcb0f18-d3b4-4775-ad74-7f6f3018fa3e"><strong>Meta-only: </strong>MacDonald said that any DTC retailer <em>under</em> $25 million in revenue <em>only</em> needs Meta. He <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/connor-macdonalds-channel-diversification-framework/id1646694096?i=1000750707074&amp;r=1509.08">added</a>, “The first million dollars we’re gonna spend are probably best spent on Meta.”</li> <li data-id="fe2c8d77-424f-40b1-a57e-f3a89e406d58"><strong>Creative portability:</strong> With Ridge reaching into the $100s of millions of annual revenue, he’s long since expanded his channels for reaching the customer and is especially enamored with video. MacDonald noted that being able to quickly take video ads — which his firm is creating for Meta ad placements — and slide them into video placements on YouTube is important. He said YouTube comprises 10-20% of Ridge campaign budgets today.</li> <li data-id="62e2c84e-b59e-4a2a-86b6-f50c6d24ada8"><strong>Incrementality tests</strong>: Ridge is <a href="https://www.haus.io/">Haus</a>’s largest client for incrementality measurement, according to MacDonald. That says something about his belief in the importance of the measurement framework.</li> <li data-id="4629924b-165d-4d68-9bf1-e597a4c4266d"><strong>Channel diversification:</strong> Though his marketing organization is always testing new (and old) channels for digital ad opportunity, MacDonald <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/connor-macdonalds-channel-diversification-framework/id1646694096?i=1000750707074&amp;r=897.02">admitted</a>, “And I wouldn’t argue we’re currently optimally allocating, but it’s a lot easier when we are far more confident in 6 channels than not that confident and we have 14 channels.” So his point was to keep channel diversification relatively tight — but always be testing.</li> </ul>
<p>It’s a revealing discussion with one of DTC’s more disciplined and successful operators. Speaking of which, Mr. MacDonald is also a panel member of the popular “<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/marketing-operators/id1739369446">Operators</a>” podcast.</p>

<p><strong>From tipsheet:</strong> Consider the implications here regarding the opportunity for the SMB market. MacDonald, an experienced online marketer, is saying if you’re an online retailer under $25 million in revs, you only need to go to one place — that’s a powerful endorsement of Meta’s AI flywheel. And Meta isn’t stopping as it refines its “machine” by investing in AI and products such as its Business AI customer service <a href="https://tipsheet.ai/technology/meta-customer-service/">chatbot strategy</a>.</p>
<p>From here, video/CTV’s proliferation seems to be a potential disruptor to — or an opportunity for — Meta.</p>

<p><strong>From tipsheet #1:</strong> What magic could a deterministic database like Catalina’s facilitate with the help of a powerful, probabilistic large language model (LLM)?</p>
<p>Infillion (which ingested MediaMath’s infrastructure in <a href="https://infillion.com/blog/mediamath-acquisition/">2023</a>) will no doubt be trying to find out with its own AI-enabled ad tech.</p>
<p><strong>From tipsheet #2:</strong> Ingesting datasets such as Catalina’s doesn’t seem to be a “thing” for LLMs yet — at least not overtly. Perhaps it steps over the line of violating “user trust” which is often <a href="https://openai.com/index/testing-ads-in-chatgpt/">cited</a> by AI companies about ads.</p>
<p>But is that “data day” coming for valuable first-party datasets? Seems like an opportunity for AI companies looking to create moats.</p>

<p>A Liquid Death Olympics ad caught the eye of Ad Age reporters as the team flagged what may be a grudging, but gradual acceptance of AI intertwined in today’s digital ad creative.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Ad Age’s Garett Sloane previewed a story penned by his colleague, Asa Hiken, on LinkedIn:</p>
<figure data-id="3ab54725-08d8-40e0-91f9-c44c58ad132b" data-type="blockquoteFigure" data-variant="2"><blockquote> <p data-id="57e298eb-4296-4c7e-947e-3ecc8e241d6e">“The Liquid Death Olympics ad is a good case study in how to use AI in marketing.</p> <p data-id="77e8fe84-2a44-4112-ab7d-2cd97659309e">The ad sparked a mystery because it streamed on Peacock and then apparently disappeared from the internet.

<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stefanopuntoni/">Stefano Puntoni</a>, a professor of marketing at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, authored a hopeful opinion piece for AI marketing believers in the Harvard Business Review.</p>
<p>Mr. Puntoni noted the transition from SEO to GEO and “conversational AI” in marketing and cited a whitepaper he published late last year with Wharton colleagues titled: “<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5634270">Conversational AI: The Next Frontier of Digital Platform Monetization.</a>”</p>
<p>Puntoni thinks things are just getting started in this new conversational AI world and concluded in HBR:</p>
<figure data-id="403c35a6-da28-464e-87eb-c85a6dd0e4bd" data-type="blockquoteFigure" data-variant="2"><blockquote> <p data-id="3d607107-f7c0-4cc2-931c-19510fed688c">“<strong>Marketing has survived disruptive transitions before: </strong>print to broadcast, broadcast to digital, desktop to mobile. Each created winners and losers. This transition goes even deeper. We’re changing not just how marketing reaches human decision-makers but potentially also who those decision-makers are. The early evidence suggests that we have a rough ride ahead, given variations in AI agent behavior across models and the opacity of how chatbots weight information. We’re heading toward a period of uncertainty and experimentation.</p> <p data-id="f33e80ae-8fda-4a93-94a0-b833c11ce1da"><strong>But uncertainty is where opportunity lives. </strong>The companies that develop expertise in conversational AI marketing and that figure out how to optimize for both human and machine customers will reap large rewards.”</p> </blockquote></figure>

<p>Yesterday, eMarketer chief content officer <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vladhanzlik/">Vladimir Hanzlik</a> reminded everyone who some of the “key companies” in digital advertising are. See the new eMarketer graphic below.</p>
<p>The list is fine-tuned to the most recent quarterly financial results reported by digital ad public companies. AI is impacting all of these companies to varying degrees.</p>
<p>One notable omission in the graphic is mobile ad technology company, AppLovin, which generated <a href="https://tipsheet.ai/news/applovin-ai-axon/">$5.4 billion in Q4 2025</a> and grew at a 70% clip.</p>
<p>The year-over-year digital ad revenue momentum would place AppLovin in second place behind LLM-favorite Reddit.</p>
