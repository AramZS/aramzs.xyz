title: 'building [at] habitat'
---
<p>With that, I'd like to introduce <a href="https://habitat.network">habitat</a>: a project exploring the edges of ATProtocol, asking, what if we didn't stop here? What if we built data permissioning, now? What are the new rules and constraints for doing multiplayer with ATProtocol? What does a search system for personal data look like with ATProtocol? What if we tried to make indexes shared infrastructure too? Can these things be built at a protocol level?</p>
<p>What if we really did just start doing things?</p>
<p>Our first project is called pear: an acronym for permission-enforcing ATProtocol repository. As we began building ATProtocol applications for ourselves and our communities (simple things like a calendar, docs, photos), we realized granular control over who sees what data cannot be a later add-on. It's a prerequisite. In the last few days, I've talked to at least ten people who didn't realize everything they were doing on Bluesky was completely public. To anyone and everyone. That's why we're building this now.</p>
<p>So much for a short introduction! That's all I'll share for now, but our small team is committed to building in the open, so it won't be long.</p>
<p>Goodbye company device, and hello network! See y'all at AtmosphereConf.</p>
