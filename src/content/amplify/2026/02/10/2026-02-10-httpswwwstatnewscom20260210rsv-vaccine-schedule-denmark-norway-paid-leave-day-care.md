<p>I was riding the subway in Oslo, Norway, when I learned about the <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2026/01/05/childhood-vaccine-schedule-new-cdc-recommendation-11-shots/">updated childhood vaccine schedule in the U.S</a>. The changes, the Department of Health and Human Services explained, were based on<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/12/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-begins-process-to-align-u-s-core-childhood-vaccine-recommendations-with-best-practices-from-peer-developed-countries/"> a memorandum</a> from President Trump stating that as part of the Make America Healthy Again strategy, childhood vaccine recommendations should be more closely aligned with “best practices from peer, developed countries.” At the time, I was on my way to pick up my half-Norwegian 2-year-old from her<em> barnehage</em>, one of Norway’s many public child care centers.</p>
<p>I exited the train, my boots crunching over the frozen ground, and continued to think about the new <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/childhood-immunization-schedule/index.html">chart I’d just read</a> from the CDC, which illustrates which vaccines will no longer be universally recommended to children in my home country. As I entered my daughter’s day care, its colorful rooms filled with toddlers and preschoolers but no actual babies, I had a terrible realization about what these changes could mean for American infants.</p>
<p>Isn’t it very dangerous, I wondered, to remove the recommendations for certain infant vaccines, particularly against RSV, in a country that continues to deny new parents the right to paid parental leave? What, I wondered, are the consequences of under-vaccinating millions of babies in a country where working parents have no other choice but to put their literal newborns in a room full of other babies all day?</p>
<p>Prior to Jan. 5, the CDC recommended that all infants be protected against RSV, either in the form of a maternal vaccination, an infant vaccination, or sometimes both, depending on the time of year of pregnancy and birth. Now, the infant vaccine has been removed from the group of “immunizations recommended to all children” and put into the “high risk” category of shots. So unless your doctor thinks there’s a specific reason for your baby to receive this vaccine, it will not be routinely offered, and is not likely to be covered by insurance.</p>
<p>RSV is a respiratory illness that’s most dangerous for babies under the age of 12 months. In the U.S., it’s the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rsv/php/surveillance/burden-estimates.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com">leading cause of infant hospitalizations</a>. But during the flu season of 2024-2025, the first year after the RSV vaccine became widely available and recommended, <a href="https://www.ajmc.com/view/infant-rsv-hospitalization-rates-drop-in-first-season-with-widespread-preventive-product-use?utm_source=chatgpt.com">hospitalizations among babies dropped by about 43%</a>, proving that it’s extremely effective.</p>

<p>I’m an American, a native of Michigan. I moved to Norway 12 years ago and had both of my children here, which means that neither of them received the RSV vaccine, nor did I. In 2023, shortly after my younger daughter was born, the maternal antibody vaccine against RSV finally became available in Norway. However, it must be requested and paid for privately at a cost about $250.</p>
<p>When my babies were newborns, I didn’t know how dangerous this virus could be, or that other countries offered protection against it. If I did, I would have joined the parents and doctors in the media who are putting immense pressure on Norwegian public health officials to include these vaccines in our national schedule.</p>
<p>But even if I had known, my concerns about this virus would have likely felt very different from those of most working American parents. And that’s because I never had to worry about my infant child catching a respiratory illness from another baby at day care.</p>
<p>I knew, even before I got pregnant, that my babies wouldn’t start day care until they were at least a year old. I knew they would be at home with me, and later, my husband. I knew this because, regardless of our employer, we have the right to take up to 59 combined weeks of paid leave. Because of this government-mandated paid leave policy, and the way our universal child care is structured, most children start <em>barnehage</em> between the ages of 1 and 2. There are simply no infants in day care in Norway.</p>
<p>With both of my daughters, now aged 6 and 2, I received 80% of my income during 10 months of leave. When I returned to work, my husband took about four months of leave, also at 80% pay. Then I took two more months of job-protected unpaid leave while receiving a caregiver subsidy of $750 a month. Both of my kids started <em>barnehage</em> at about 16 months old, when they were out of the most high-risk age group for developing severe complications of RSV.</p>
<p>This is not at all to claim that young babies in Norway never contract RSV, or that keeping them at home longer is a guarantee against them catching it or becoming severely ill. Each year in Norway, <a href="https://uit.no/nyheter/forskerhjornet/864424/de_arlige_rs-virusepidemiene_blant_spedbarn_kan_u#:~:text=Barneavdelinger%20fylt%20opp%20til%20randen,barn%20sliter%20med%20%C3%A5%20puste.">about 2%</a> of babies infected with RSV are admitted to the hospital. In 2023, the Norwegian Institute of Public Health began advising doctors to recommend the maternal vaccine to pregnant women, though it has yet to be become part of the free national schedule.</p>
<p>For context, I think it’s important for Americans to understand why countries like Norway recommend fewer vaccines than the United States historically has. The short answer is that with a publicly funded national health care system, decisions like what to include in a childhood vaccine schedule are largely based on a cost/benefit analysis.</p>
<p>The vaccines that are chosen are those deemed most critical for preventing the most severe illness and death. For example, the chickenpox vaccine is not included in our national schedule since while the virus can make children very sick, it’s not as lethal as other diseases, like polio or measles. But these recommendations evolve. As of September 2025, <a href="https://news.ki.se/even-healthy-children-can-be-severely-affected-by-rsv">Sweden began recommending the RSV vaccine</a> to all newborns. In October 2025, <a href="https://en.ssi.dk/news/epi-news/2025/no-38---2025">Denmark started to offer free RSV vaccines to all pregnant women</a>. Norway will likely soon follow suit.</p>
<p>The CDC’s updated vaccine schedule was largely created on the basis of <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/cdc-acts-presidential-memorandum-update-childhood-immunization-schedule.html">trying to emulate the schedules of “peer nations.</a>” As many critics have pointed out, one cannot copy the vaccine policies of another nation and expect it to have the same effect. The demographics of every country are unique and so are their risk factors for the spread of disease. Both Norway and Denmark, our close geographic and cultural neighbor, have much smaller populations with less income inequality than the United States.</p>

<p>And critically, all of the other countries mentioned as exemplary “peer nations” provide their citizens with universal health care. In Norway, all health care is free for children under 16. If a Norwegian baby undergoes a long hospitalization due to complications from RSV, the only thing their parents have to worry about is their sick baby. For an American baby’s family, a single vaccine could be the difference between a runny nose and medical bankruptcy.</p>
<p>All of these arguments are valid and important. But I also think that the United States’ lack of a federal paid leave policy should be a primary concern as we enter this new terrain of fewer childhood vaccine recommendations. At a time when universal child care is (finally) getting introduced in states like Vermont, New Mexico, and New York, many more families will soon be able to access and afford child care.</p>
<p>This is great progress. But in lieu of a federal paid leave policy, this also means that many more babies will be entering day care at a very young age, likely leading to more disease spread and severe illness among our tiniest Americans.</p>
<p>It really doesn’t have to be this way, though. We could protect them better. We could choose, as a country, to let babies be at home longer. We could pay their parent or other family member to be their primary caregiver during those first, very vulnerable weeks of life. We could do what our peer nations do.</p>
<p>On the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/slides-2025-12-04-05/01-Hoeg-Danish-vax-schedule-508.pdf">CDC’s website is a report</a> that uses Denmark and other peer countries as the benchmark for the U.S.’s new immunization recommendations. The researcher who prepared the report refers to the U.S. as an outlier compared with the vaccine policies of Denmark, Canada, Germany, Sweden, the U.K., and Japan. But if we want to talk about the U.S. being a policy outlier, shouldn’t we look instead at the most obvious difference? Denmark offers about 52 weeks of paid parental leave. Sweden gives 69. Germany, 47. Canada, 28, Japan, 26. The U.K., 39. The United States: zero.</p>
<p>You don’t even need to look abroad to see how paid leave improves the health of babies. A <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2822790">2024 study in JAMA Pediatrics</a> showed that after New York introduced eight weeks of paid family leave in 2018, “acute care encounters for respiratory tract infections [in infants 8 weeks and younger] were 18% lower after the introduction of paid family leave than in the absence of the policy.”</p>
<p>In other words, newborn babies in New York caught RSV less, and were hospitalized less, because they were at home in the care of a family member instead of at day care. Now imagine if this period of paid leave was three or even six months instead of eight weeks, and if this right extended not just to New Yorkers, but to every working American. Just think how much healthier our children could be.</p>
