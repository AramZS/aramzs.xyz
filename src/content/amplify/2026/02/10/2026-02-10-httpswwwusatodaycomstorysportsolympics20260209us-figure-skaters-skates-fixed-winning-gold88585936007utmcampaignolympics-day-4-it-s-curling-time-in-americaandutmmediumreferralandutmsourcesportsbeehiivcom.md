<p>MILAN — It wasn’t all great for <a data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2026/02/08/olympics-figure-skating-live-results-updates-team-event/88572152007/">Team USA figure skating to win gold</a> at the <a data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" href="https://www.usatoday.com/sports/olympics/">2026 Winter Olympics</a>.</p>
<p>U.S. skaters had their skates messed up after the medal ceremony on Sunday, Feb. 8, and needed to get them fixed, a person with knowledge of the situation told USA TODAY Sports.</p>
<p>The person spoke on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the situation.</p>
<p>The issue was a result of the medal podium, as it was not covered in carpet or a similar soft surface, the person said, leading to scratches and potential damages to the skates.</p>
<p>Typically, skaters put on skate guards whenever they are not on the ice to prevent damage. All the medalists came onto the ice for the medal ceremony, but there were not skate guards for them to put on when they stepped on the podium, leaving them without a chance to protect the blades.</p>
<p>Team USA did do a jump on the podium.</p>
<p>It’s unknown the severity of damage to some skates, or who was affected, but damage to blades at the Olympics is not an ideal scenario.</p>
<p>Issues with blades could lead to having to change skates, a doomsday scenario for skaters since it usually <a data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2026/02/04/ilia-malinin-new-skates-2026-winter-olympics/88505341007/">takes some time to break them in</a> before they feel comfortable with them.</p>
<p>The ice dance pairs will skate on Monday, Feb. 9.</p>
