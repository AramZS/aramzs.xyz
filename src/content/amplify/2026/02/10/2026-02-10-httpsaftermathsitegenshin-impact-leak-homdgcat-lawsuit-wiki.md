title: Genshin Impact Maker Suing To Take Down Fan Wiki
---
<figure><figcaption>Image: HoYoverse </figcaption></figure>
<p><em>Genshin Impact</em> maker HoYoverse is suing to take down a fan wiki dedicated to its popular game, <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/995231354/Genshin-Impact-Maker-Suing-To-Take-Down-Fan-Wiki?ref=aftermath.site"><u>according to documents filed in a Georgia court</u></a>. HoYoverse's lawyers say that the person who maintains <a href="https://homdgcat.wiki/about?ref=aftermath.site"><u>the HomDGCat website</u></a>—who goes by the alias HomDGCat—"has engaged in a sustained, coordinated campaign to steal and publicly disseminate" unreleased <em>Genshin Impact</em> and <em>Honkai: Star Rail</em> content and events. HomDGCat describes the website as a place to "efficiently provide[s] data for all players," alongside guides and information about game updates, but HoYoverse claims he’s built it "into a massive compendium of infringing and unlawfully disclosed content."</p>
<p>The website, which is a thorough wiki with detailed tutorials, character guides, and change logs related to <em>Genshin Impact</em>, is quite popular and useful to players; <em>Genshin Impact</em> players found the website easy to use and the information neat and organized. HoYoverse says it has attempted to "stem [HomDGCat's] conduct" multiple times. In January, HomDGCat announced that he was turning over the HomDGCat Telegram channel to another person after "certain things that happened recently in real life," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact_Leaks/comments/1q4tdyw/about_homdgcat_channel/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>according to a post on his Telegram account</u></a>. It's unclear whether he's relinquished ownership of the website as well, but <em>Genshin Impact</em> players on Reddit immediately started mourning the possible loss of the website. In January, the HomDGCat website was also updated with a disclaimer that reads "HomDGCat Wiki will only update live game data in the future.”</p>
<p>HoYoverse's lawyers say HomDGCat got hold of unreleased content by "exhorting participants in [HoYoverse's] beta testing program to breach their non-disclosure and confidentiality obligations" by giving access to the beta packages to HomDGCat. HoYoverse included a screenshot in the lawsuit of HomDGCat asking beta players to send beta files to him to aid in datamining and research. Using unauthorized access to the beta, lawyers say, HomDGCat was able to get information about updates before they were released, then upload information to his website. HoYoverse lawyers say HomDGCat posted "thousands, if not tens of thousands" of pieces of unreleased content from both <em>Genshin Impact</em> and <em>Honkai: Star Rail</em>. Even the publicly available information is a problem for HoYoverse: It doesn't want HomDGCat to use copyrighted artwork at all.</p>
<p>The HomDGCat website also has a section that includes a way for players to read and search through all text and dialogue for <em>Genshin Impact</em> and <em>Honkai: Star Rail</em>, which the company described as "unlawful conduct."</p>
<p>HoYoverse says the company has suffered due to the leaked content—"negatively impacted public interest and enthusiasm," giving HoYoverse's "competitors unfair insight and knowledge" about unreleased content, and by infringing the company's copyrights. The company says it sent several DMCA takedown notices. In December, lawyers sent HomDGCat emails and physical letters with a cease-and-desist. HomDGCat responded, HoYoverse's lawyers say, and agreed to comply with some demands—but not all.</p>
<p>"He did not agree to refrain from his unlawful datamining activities or from improperly soliciting beta packets, and all or nearly all of the materials on the HomDGCat Website remain available," lawyers say.</p>
<p>HoYoverse is asking the court to shut down the HomDGCat website and social media accounts, and for damages related to the alleged harm to the company for trade secret misappropriation, copyright infringement, circumvention of technological measures, breach of contract, and tortious interference with contractual relations.</p>
<p>HoYoverse has been trying, desperately, to stop its major problem with leaks. It's filed several different lawsuits <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/four-genshin-impact-leakers-targeted-in-new-set-of-dmca-subpoenas-230113/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>and sought out leakers via court subpoenas</u></a>, including <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/honkai-star-rail-castorice-leak-lawsuit-hoyoverse?ref=aftermath.site"><u>one filed in June of 2025 over the streaming of unreleased content</u></a>. That leaker didn't show up to court, <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/honkai-star-rail-lawsuit-leaker-ruling?ref=aftermath.site"><u>and HoYoverse won a default judgement with a $15,000 fine</u></a>. HoYoverse also went after a <a href="https://www.dlapiper.com/en-ca/news/2024/12/dla-piper-secures-infringement-judgment-for-genshin-impact-publisher-hoyoverse?ref=aftermath.site"><u><em>Genshin Impact</em> hack creator in a Canadian court in 2024</u></a> and won $1.5 million in damages.</p>
<p>HoYoverse has not responded to Aftermath's request for comment by publication time, and HomDGCat was unable to be reached.</p>
