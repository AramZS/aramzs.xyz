<p><i><p><i>By </i><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/alan-feuer">Alan Feuer</a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/glenn-thrush">Glenn Thrush</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/michael-s-schmidt">Michael S. Schmidt</a></p></i></p>
<p>Federal prosecutors in Washington sought and failed on Tuesday to secure an indictment against six Democratic lawmakers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/18/us/politics/democratic-lawmakers-illegal-orders.html">who posted a video this fall</a> that enraged President Trump by reminding active-duty members of the military and intelligence community that they were obligated to refuse illegal orders, four people familiar with the matter said.</p>
<p>It was remarkable that the U.S. attorney’s office in Washington — led by Jeanine Pirro, a longtime ally of Mr. Trump’s — authorized prosecutors to go into a grand jury and ask for an indictment of the six members of Congress, all of whom had served in the military or the nation’s spy agencies.</p>
<p>But it was even more remarkable that a group of ordinary citizens sitting on the grand jury in Federal District Court in Washington rejected the effort, sending a signal that they did not believe that the lawmakers had committed any crimes.</p>
<p>It had been exceedingly rare for grand jurors to rebuff requests by prosecutors seeking indictments, although <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/06/us/trump-dc-national-guard-grand-juries-crime.html">it has happened with increased frequency</a> to the Justice Department under Mr. Trump, as his appointees push ahead with questionable cases.</p>
<p>The move to charge the lawmakers — among them, Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona and Senator Elissa Slotkin of Michigan — was, by any measure, an extraordinary attempt by prosecutors <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/25/us/politics/trump-retribution-comey-indictment.html">to politicize the criminal justice system</a> even for a Justice Department that has repeatedly shattered norms of independence from the White House and followed Mr. Trump’s directives to prosecute his adversaries.</p>
<p>Prosecutors presenting the case sought to persuade the grand jurors that the lawmakers had violated a statute that forbids interfering with the loyalty, morale or discipline of the U.S. armed forces, according to one of the people familiar with the matter.</p>
