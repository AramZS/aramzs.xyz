<p>KNOXVILLE, Tenn. — U.S. Congressman Andy Ogles is now <a href="https://ogles.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/ogles.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/letter-e-c-bad-bunny.pdf">calling for an investigation</a> into Bad Bunny's <a href="https://www.wbir.com/article/sports/nfl/superbowl/live-updates-super-bowl-lx-seahawks-patriots/281-4cb1481f-be5f-4503-860e-c2da8c0d02f8">Super Bowl</a> performance, citing issues such as "widespread twerking."</p>
<p>In a letter sent to fellow U.S. Congressman Brett Guthrie, Ogles said the performance featured "widespread twerking, grinding, pelvic thrusts and other sexually suggestive content," namely during the performance of the song "Safaera."</p>
<p>Bad Bunny performed his set entirely in Spanish, because all of his music is recorded in that language, aside from his collaborations with English-language artists. The only English singing on the field came from Lady Gaga.</p>
<p>Ogles stated that he wants to "ensure that we hold Spanish language content to the same standards and expectations we have for English language content," specifically when it comes to sexual content. He stated the song's performance in Spanish "did not mitigate the explicit nature of the material."</p>
<p>In his letter, Ogles asked that the Committee on Energy and Commerce, which oversees broadcast regulation and FCC oversight, examine what knowledge the NFL and NBCUniversal executives, producers and standards personnel had about the "explicit nature of the selected songs," as well as the choreography. He also requested that the committee examine:</p>
<ul><li>The internal review, translation, and approval processes are used in preparing the halftime show for live broadcast.</li><li>Whether existing safeguards, including broadcast delay protocols and standards review procedures, were properly applied or intentionally disregarded</li><li>The broader implications for broadcaster accountability when explicit content is aired during programming that reaches a national audience of families and minors.</li></ul>
<p>He stated that, while the FCC's direct licensing authority pertains primarily to local broadcast stations, Congress still should ensure that rules are adequately enforced.</p>
<p>On social media, Ogles referred to the performance as "<a href="https://x.com/RepOgles/status/2021002549491302715?s=20">pure smut</a>" and said the lyrics glorified "unspeakable depravities." You can view his whole statement below.</p>

<p>🚨The Apple Music Super Bowl LX Halftime Show was pure smut, brazenly aired on national television for every American family to witness. Children were forced to endure explicit displays of gay sexual acts, women gyrating provocatively, and Bad Bunny shamelessly grabbing his crotch while dry-humping the air. </p><p>And if that weren't outrageous enough, the performance's lyrics openly glorified sodomy and countless other unspeakable depravities. These flagrant, indecent acts are illegal to be displayed on public airways. </p><p>That is why I am requesting that the Energy and Commerce Committee launch a formal congressional inquiry into the National Football League and NBC immediately for their prior knowledge, deliberate approval, and facilitation of this indecent broadcast. American culture will not be mocked or corrupted without consequence.</p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/HAwLEXxaAAEttIu.jpg"/><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/HAwLEYNbYAEYZ46.jpg"/>

<p>For around 13 minutes, all eyes on the field, and around the world, were focused on Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio.</p>
<p>His set featured a large wedding, as many of the scenes and <a href="https://www.wbir.com/article/sports/nfl/superbowl/real-wedding-bad-bunny-halftime-show-super-bowl/507-972b7eb6-37a1-4b0b-92db-8d78582c92ff">representatives confirm that it was real</a>. The couple allegedly invited Bad Bunny to their wedding, but he couldn't attend due to his halftime show performance. So, instead, he invited them to be part of his Super Bowl show.</p>
<p>About five minutes into the show at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California, a smiling officiant declared the couple dressed in white married, and the husband and wife shared a kiss as dancers and musicians surrounded them and smiled.</p>
<p>During a segment where Lady Gaga joined Bad Bunny to perform "BAILE INoLVIDABLE," they took their vows. Bad Bunny served as a witness and signed their marriage certificate.</p>
<p>Bad Bunny ended the performance saying "God bless America" and listed every country in North, South and Latin America by name: “Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Brazil” and so on, including the United States and Canada — a reminder that while it is common to use “America” as a synonym for the U.S. in the U.S., it is the <a href="https://www.wbir.com/article/sports/nfl/superbowl/trump-critiques-bad-bunny-super-bowl-halftime-show/507-5cd226dd-020f-415f-a23f-c161e63d7fdf">name used across two continents</a> — while dancers carried their flags across the field and through the sugar cane bushes.</p>
<p>“And my motherland, mi patria, Puerto Rico, seguimos aquí.” In English, “My homeland, Puerto Rico, we are still here.”</p>
<p>Behind him, a screen read, "The only thing more powerful than hate is love" in English text, a direct reference to one of his recent speeches at the 2026 Grammys.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.wbir.com/article/sports/nfl/superbowl/bad-bunny-super-bowl-halftime-show-salary-2026/507-92797bb7-7630-4777-82f8-d9ddc8ea583f">NFL may cover travel costs for artists</a>, but maintains its long-standing tradition of not paying performers for the pregame and halftime shows beyond the minimum union scale requirements. Under union agreements, this typically amounts to around $1,000 per day for rehearsals and the performance itself. That means no splashy appearance fees for these major artists.</p>
<p>However, the real value of the Super Bowl halftime show lies in its unprecedented exposure. The 2024 performance headlined by Usher drew massive viewership, continuing the trend set by Rihanna's 2023 show, which attracted 115 million viewers. For artists, this exposure typically translates into significant increases in music sales and streaming numbers.</p>
<p>On Sunday, <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2026/02/the-biggest-hits-of-bad-bunnys-apple-music-super-bowl-lx-halftime-show/">Apple Music confirmed that the number of simultaneous Bad Bunny listeners spiked immediately after halftime</a>. They stated that Bad Bunny's listeners on Apple Music were up 7x. “DtMF,” “BAILE INoLVIDABLE,” and “Tití Me Preguntó” were the most-streamed songs immediately after the show, according to Apple Music, all of which were performed during the halftime show.</p>
