<p>Recently, the <a href="https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/news/releases/attorney-general-ken-paxton-launches-wide-sweeping-investigation-unlawful-financial-incentives">Texas attorney general</a> launched a formal investigation into what he called “unlawful financial incentives” for childhood vaccines, saying that he would “ensure that Big Pharma and Big Insurance don’t bribe medical providers to pressure parents to jab their kids.”</p>
<p>The timing was uncanny. The four of us had just completed a six-month investigation into this exact question: Do pediatricians get rich from vaccines?</p>
<p>Our answer, after analyzing available commercial reimbursement data from four major insurers across all 50 states, reviewing state Medicaid fee schedules, and interviewing pediatricians about the financial realities of vaccine delivery: no. And the truth is far more complicated than the false profit narrative suggests.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2022/jan/19/instagram-posts/no-blue-cross-blue-shield-physicians-arent-paid-bo/">idea</a> that pediatricians get rich from vaccines has circulated for years, most recently amplified by public officials, including Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. “Doctors are being paid to vaccinate, not to evaluate,” <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/fact-checking-rfk-jr-s-claim-that-pediatricians-recommend-vaccines-for-money">Kennedy said</a> in August. “They’re pressured to follow the money, not the science.”</p>
<p>These claims typically reference insurance company quality programs but fundamentally misrepresent how they work.</p>

<p>First, the source of payment matters: Pharmaceutical companies do not pay pediatricians to vaccinate children. It would be illegal for them to do so under <a href="https://oig.hhs.gov/compliance/physician-education/fraud-abuse-laws/">federal anti-kickback laws</a>.</p>
<p>Quality incentive payments come from insurance companies, not vaccine manufacturers. Insurers structure these programs because preventive care keeps their members healthy and out of emergency rooms, saving them money.</p>
<p>Second, viral claims misrepresent what these programs reward. Quality programs often tie payments to dozens of care metrics, including developmental screenings, chronic disease management, and patient satisfaction. Immunization is one component among many.</p>
<h2>The real economics are messier</h2>
<p>If the profit narrative were true, we’d expect pediatricians to eagerly expand vaccine services. We found the opposite: <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5600475/">24% have considered stopping vaccine delivery entirely</a> — not because they doubt vaccines, but because offering them at all is a financial strain.</p>
<p>The economics vary dramatically depending on where you practice and who you serve. In Colorado, commercial insurers pay a median of <a href="https://pediatricsupport.com/analysis-of-codes-affecting-pediatrics">$42</a> for vaccine administration; Medicaid pays <a href="https://hcpf.colorado.gov/provider-rates-fee-schedule">$21</a>. In Mississippi, commercial rates hover around <a href="https://pediatricsupport.com/analysis-of-codes-affecting-pediatrics">$22</a>, while Medicaid pays just <a href="https://medicaid.ms.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/VACCINE-FEE-SCHEDULE-10-3-2022-FNL.pdf">$11.68</a>, well below what it actually costs to store and administer a vaccine.</p>
<p>Some practices with favorable payer mixes break even or earn modest margins. Many serving Medicaid and uninsured children lose money on every dose. This isn’t a story about greedy doctors. It’s a story about a fragmented payment system that places the greatest financial burden on practices serving the most vulnerable children.</p>
<h2>What the profit narrative misses</h2>
<p>The focus on supposed physician profits obscures the real policy problem: Inadequate reimbursement is threatening vaccine access.</p>
<p>Pediatricians who serve high proportions of Medicaid patients face a brutal calculation. They can absorb financial losses to protect children in their communities. They can limit the number of Medicaid patients they accept. Or they can stop offering vaccines altogether and refer families elsewhere, adding barriers that may mean some children don’t get vaccinated at all.</p>

<p>The profit accusation also misunderstands that vaccine payments don’t go into physicians’ pockets. When a practice breaks even or earns a modest margin, this revenue helps fund the practice so it can better serve families through programs such as after-hours nurse lines, mental health counseling, and care coordinators. When reimbursement fails to cover costs, practices may cut these services, sell to larger health systems, or close entirely.</p>
<p>Adult primary care offers a cautionary tale. Facing these same pressures, many adult physicians simply stopped offering vaccines. Today, <a href="https://ghlf.org/ghlf-news/report-demonstrates-that-pharmacist-administered-vaccinations-have-increased-since-the-onset-of-the-covid-19-pandemic/">adults frequently get vaccinated at pharmacies</a> — not because pharmacies provide better care, but because doctors’ offices <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9004468/">can’t afford</a> to stock and administer vaccines at a loss. Pediatricians haven’t followed suit because they feel an obligation to protect children despite the financial hit.</p>
<p>Pediatricians are among the last bastions of trust in American health care — the ones who show up in “Paw Patrol” scrubs when our kids are miserable, who answer panicked calls about fevers at midnight, and who chose one of the <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/11/27/pediatrics-residency-match-pay-pediatrician-shortage/">lowest-paid specialties in medicine</a> because they wanted to care for children. Eroding trust in them has consequences. When parents are led to believe their pediatrician’s recommendations are driven by profit rather than their child’s health, they delay or decline vaccines. And children get sick.</p>
<p>If policymakers genuinely want to examine vaccine economics, they should ask why reimbursement rates vary so widely across states, why Medicaid payments often fall below delivery costs, and why the burden of protecting vulnerable children falls disproportionately on the practices least able to afford it.</p>
<p>The pediatricians we interviewed didn’t talk about bonuses. They talked about months-long waits for reimbursement, the impossible math of serving kids on Medicaid, and the kids themselves. The ones they’ve watched grow up. The families who trust them. They keep vaccinating, not because it’s profitable (it usually isn’t), but because it protects children.</p>
<p>Understanding the actual economics matters, because the physicians most committed to vaccinating children are often the ones making the least from it.</p>
