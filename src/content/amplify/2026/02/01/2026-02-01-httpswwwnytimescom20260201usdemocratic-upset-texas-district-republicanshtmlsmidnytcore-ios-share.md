<p><i><p><i>By </i><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/j-david-goodman">J. David Goodman</a></p><blockquote><p>Reporting from Houston</p></blockquote></i></p>
<p>In an upset that rattled Republicans in Texas and beyond, a Democrat decisively won a state legislative special election on Saturday in a district around Fort Worth that President Trump carried by more than 17 percentage points just over a year ago.</p>
<p>The Democrat, Taylor Rehmet, a local union leader and first-time candidate, defeated the Republican, Leigh Wambsganss, by double digits — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2026/01/31/us/elections/results-texas-special-runoff.html">57 to 43</a> — in the historically conservative district.</p>
<p>The contest to fill a State Senate seat <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/29/us/politics/taylor-rehmet-leigh-wambsganss-texas-election.html">had been closely followed</a> by national leaders from both parties as a barometer of potential Republican struggles in this year’s midterm elections.</p>
<p>It attracted outsized attention after Mr. Rehmet, 33, performed far better than expected in the first round of voting in November and ended up in the runoff. Since then, he received a surge of support from Democratic groups, including the Democratic National Committee.</p>
<p>Republican leaders, concerned that a defeat could bring an influx of Democratic investment into Texas races in 2026, tried to rally support for Ms. Wambsganss. She received an endorsement from President Trump and the backing of prominent conservative leaders in Texas, including Gov. Greg Abbott and Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick. The chairman of the Republican National Committee <a href="https://x.com/LeighForTexas/status/2017286080400064689">met with Ms. Wambsganss last week</a>.</p>
<p>The unusually timed election attracted low turnout in a district of Tarrant County that includes portions of Fort Worth and its northern suburbs. Mr. Patrick, in the run up to the race, pleaded with Republicans to vote in the special election, which fell on a Saturday. Mr. Trump also urged voters to vote <a href="https://x.com/LeighForTexas/status/2017421681493487806">in a social media post on Friday</a>.</p>
