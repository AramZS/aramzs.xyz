<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates that United States net <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/greenhouse-gas-emission">greenhouse gas emissions</a> have declined over the last two decades and are now about 17 % below their 2005 level. However, a large body of independent measurements suggests that over the same time frame, surging oil and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/natural-gas-production">natural gas production</a> from shale formations increased emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas and the main component of natural gas, well beyond EPA estimates. Accounting for these increased methane emissions removes over two-thirds of the apparent post-2005 decline in United States net <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/greenhouse-gas-emission">greenhouse gas emissions</a>. This result suggests that Americans may need to work harder than expected to reduce emissions at a speed and scale consistent with international climate goals, highlights the need to mitigate methane emissions, and calls into question the role of natural gas in climate action plans. Other nations should carefully consider methane emissions when evaluating the climate impacts of oil and natural gas imported from the United States.</p>
<h2>Section snippets</h2>
<h2>Methane and natural gas infrastructure</h2>
<p>Human activities that emit methane, the main component of natural gas, account for about 0.5</p>
<figure></figure><p>∘C of global mean surface temperature rise over pre-industrial levels, compared to about 0.8</p>
<figure></figure><p>∘C from all anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions since the Industrial Revolution (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2021a). Methane is a potent and fast-acting greenhouse gas, causing 82.5 (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 56.7–108.3) times more radiative forcing per unit mass than carbon dioxide over a</p>
<h2>Adjusted emission estimates</h2>
<p>The unadjusted EPA estimates of net United States emissions (Fig. 1, left plot, black curve) show a fairly consistent decline from the 2005 value of 6.6 billion tonnes per year (Gt/a) of carbon dioxide equivalent. This apparent decline is attributed largely to natural gas power plants displacing coal-fired electricity generation (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2023), as unconventional oil and natural gas supply from shale formations surged due to innovations in horizontal drilling and</p>
<h2>Policy considerations</h2>
<p>Three policy considerations arise from the result that methane emissions from natural gas infrastructure largely erode the apparent post-2005 decline in United States emissions. First, the United States may need deeper and faster climate action than previously thought to meet its Nationally Determined Contributions under the Paris Agreement of (a) reducing net emissions 50 %–52 % below 2005 levels by 2030, (b) reducing net emissions 61 %–66 % below 2005 levels by 2035, and (c) reaching net zero</p>
