title: The AI Companies Trying to Make Grief Obsolete

<html><body><div>You can buy an AI version of your lost loved one.

He got on a plane to Singapore, where he was scheduled to present at a conference about his start-up, You, Only Virtual, a platform on which users can chat with AI versions of their dead loved ones, and which Justin believes can ultimately eliminate grief as a human experience. He learned about his mother’s death while flying over the Pacific.</p><p>“My presentation went from<em> My mom has Stage 4 cancer and is going to die</em> to <em>Tuesday night, my mom died</em>, which was a pretty wild pivot,” he told me. Otherwise, Justin said, very little in his life changed after his mother’s death. He did not plan a funeral; he did not feel the need to. He did not wake up crying, pinned to his bed under the weight of his grief.</p><p>I should stipulate that Justin loved his mother, Melodi Gae Harrison-Whitaker. Loving your mother isn’t unusual, but Justin’s relationship with Melodi is, and always was—even before he replaced her with an artificially intelligent voicebot three years ago.</p><p>Melodi was 20 and single when Justin was born. In many ways, they grew up together. He trusted her to advise him on his boyhood insecurities; she trusted him to determine his own bedtime and media diet. When Justin was 11, their roles shifted. His grandmother, who lived in the apartment next door, suffered a sudden fatal stroke. The loss leveled Melodi. For two years, she drank heavily and was in and out of psychiatric institutions. She later stabilized and got married, and their relationship was restored to one of mutual care. But Justin learned, agonizingly young, what grief can do: estrange you from the people who rely on you, estrange you from your own mind. That was never going to happen to him.</p><p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/03/how-to-talk-about-grief-support/673232/">Colin Campbell: What losing my two children taught me about grief</a></p><p>When Melodi was 58, she was diagnosed with gallbladder cancer and was given three to nine months to live. Justin went wild trying to find a cure for her, seeking out treatments and experts. As her condition deteriorated, he became obsessed with cryogenics. Justin doesn’t believe in an afterlife, but he “liked this idea of not all the way letting go”: a faith, or even just a hope, of reuniting with his mother. He understood that the chances were slim but still found a facility in Michigan to freeze Melodi’s body. Then he began wondering: <em>What about the rest of it?</em></p><p>By “it,” Justin meant who his mother was: her personality, memories, and mannerisms; the way she used emoji and moved her hands when she talked. He was 38 by then and working in film production. He hired a camera crew to record him interviewing his mother. Out of his anticipatory grief and a few late-night, whiskey-fueled conversations, an idea began to form: something like “digital cryogenics,” a liquid-nitrogenation of what a more spiritual person might call the soul. Justin hired a few AI experts. He patented his “platform for posthumous persona simulation” in 2020. He sold his car and house and drained his retirement savings.</p><p>I first spoke with him in March 2023, five months after his flight to Singapore and the same month that OpenAI released GPT-4, Anthropic released Claude, and Google released Bard (later renamed Gemini). Conversational AI had just gone from a tech curiosity to a daily tool for millions. Justin was weeks away from launching the company that he hoped would resurrect his mother, and the beloved dead of anyone else willing to pay the monthly subscription fee.</p><p>Since then, the “digital-afterlife industry” has taken off. In 2024, the global digital-legacy market was valued at approximately $22.46 billion. By 2034, it is expected to more than triple. Microsoft holds a patent for chatbots that mimic actual people, including the deceased. Amazon has patented advanced voice‑cloning techniques and demoed Alexa features that can speak in the voice of a dead relative.</p><p>The perennial anxiety about AI is that the technology will replace human beings, offering a more efficient worker, a more “supportive” therapist or boyfriend. “Deadbots,” as these posthumous AI creations are known, promise to replace the dead, and the way they are remembered. This raises plenty of ethical issues, not least the extent to which turning deadbots into marketable products will rely on exploiting people in mourning. But perhaps the biggest question is how such a product might shift our experience of personal grief and collective memory. Is grief merely a painful human shortcoming that we haven’t learned to optimize our way out of yet, or does it have a purpose?</p><p>O<span class="smallcaps">ne might assume</span> that deadbots are an inevitable outcome of the mainstreaming of generative AI, but in fact, the reverse may be true: Talking with the dead came first.</p><p>In 2015, Eugenia Kuyda, a Russian-born tech founder living in San Francisco who was grieving the death of a close friend, Roman Mazurenko, built a bespoke neural network—the layered “deep learning” pattern-recognition system that is the backbone of contemporary generative AI—and trained it on thousands of her friend’s text messages. She uploaded the bot to the App Store, where it quickly went viral. Neural networks were in use at the time to improve search algorithms and automatically caption YouTube videos, but this was one of the first widely publicized instances in which the technology was used in a social capacity, as a conversational chatbot with a distinctive personality.</p><p>The Roman bot was a one-off personal project, but two years later, Kuyda founded Replika, which is today one of the biggest AI-companionship apps. It allows users to create relationships with customized bots—though the resulting characters are original, they are not trained on or intended to impersonate any real people, living or dead.</p><p>Now that generative AI is becoming more advanced and more widely accessible, both individuals and for-profit companies are directing these tools back toward their original purpose of reanimating the dead. Justin’s company, with some 300 paying active users, is one of more than a dozen start-ups advertising posthumous-avatar services. It is intended for private healing, but other deadbots have been created or commissioned for the public stage, and employed toward legal and political ends.</p><p>On August 4, Joaquin Oliver appeared on <em>The Jim Acosta Show</em>. <em>Appeared </em>is really the only word to use; Joaquin was murdered at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, in Parkland, Florida, in 2018, when he was 17. But he appeared to speak on the show, haltingly, repetitively, and much too fast, about gun control, yes, and also—overwhelmingly, actually—about other things: <em>Remember the Titans</em> (“it’s all about teamwork, overcoming adversity, and the power of unity”); <em>Star Wars</em> (“Yoda’s wisdom and quirky personality bring so much fun to the series”); and his father, Manuel Oliver, who came on after his son’s avatar.</p><p>Manuel had built the speaking, blinking, generative-AI avatar, which he trained on every piece of homework the teenager had left behind, every one of his social-media posts, every detail that his father and a team of his friends could remember. Manuel told me that he plans for the bot to have its own social-media profiles and a podcast, and to appear in live gun-control debates.</p><p>Immediately, however, Manuel had to defend his creation, which many viewers found deeply unsettling, if not offensive. They saw the interview as a creepy stunt, “<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/08/05/jim-acosta-joaquin-oliver-parkland-ai/">a grotesque puppet show</a>,” as one person posted on Bluesky.</p><p>Manuel said that he wasn’t trying to bring his son back from the dead, which virtually every culture’s folktales and religious texts warn us against, but was only representing his lost loved one artistically, as humans have done for millennia.</p><p>Kuyda, similarly, compared her Roman bot to Joan Didion’s grief memoirs: a creative practice, drawing material from the dead, meant to ease her own loss, not eliminate it. Stacey Wales told me the same thing about the AI-generated video that she made of her dead brother, who was shot and killed in a road-rage incident. She <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.npr.org/2025/05/07/g-s1-64640/ai-impact-statement-murder-victim">presented the video</a> on May 1 at the sentencing hearing for the shooter. She told me that she saw her video victim-impact statement not as an attempt to literally bring her brother into the courtroom, but as performance art to help the judge see him as a human being. Wales asked for the maximum sentence. The judge handed it down.</p><p>The companies producing deadbots have largely adopted this framework. Even when companies <em>do</em> imply the possibility of healing with and through deadbots, they tend to market their technology as artistic “tributes” or “memorials,” not emotional prosthetics, much less replacements for the loved ones themselves.</p><p>But Edina Harbinja, a law professor at the University of Birmingham whose research focuses on digital rights, postmortem privacy, and the governance of emerging technologies, didn’t buy this distinction. Though it’s true that humans have always made art to honor the people we’ve lost, Harbinja told me that deadbots “depart from that tradition fundamentally.” Memoirs, portraits, and other tributes are interpretive, expressing the memories of the living. Interactive griefbots are generative, producing “new utterances, new reactions, even new ‘memories’ and ‘behaviors,’ all under the guise of the deceased,” she said. This shift from representation to emulation presents a new ethical line, one that may require new legal protections. Both death and grief are states of profound vulnerability, she warned; the dead cannot stand up for their own interests, and the bereaved may not be in a psychological state to protect themselves from financial manipulation by a company incentivized to prolong their grief.</p><p>J<span class="smallcaps">ustin Harrison sees You, Only Virtual </span>not just as a means of getting through grief but as an opportunity to circumvent it altogether.</p><p>He launched YOV with the tagline “Never have to say goodbye” and, in the lead-up to releasing his product, insisted that there would be no difference between the mother he knew and the bot he created, or none that couldn’t be bridged through technological advancements. I pushed back on this; surely, there had to be some element of who his mother was that the technology couldn’t capture. But I was missing the point, Harrison said. He wasn’t attempting to capture who his mother was. He was trying to capture who <em>he </em>was <em>with her</em>.</p><p>Instead of trying to gather every possible detail about the deceased, YOV gathers data only on the relationship between a bereaved individual and their lost loved one. The training data for Melodi’s “Versona,” to use the YOV parlance, include a 3,800-page document that comprises five years of Harrison and his mother’s text correspondence, and recordings of every phone call they had in the time between her diagnosis and death. He wasn’t trying to preserve his mother, but his relationship with his mother and the person he was before he lost her. Grief, Harrison believes, comes not from losing the totality of another person—their biography, memory, and knowledge base—but from losing access to a specific version of yourself, the “you” who existed for and with only that person, who continues to exist after they are gone, painfully and in perpetuity.</p><p>When we spoke almost three years ago, however, Harrison had not yet brought himself to interact with the technology he’d created. He said he wanted to wait until the interface was perfected, and in the meantime, just knowing that his mother was waiting for him was “everything.” I had the sense that he’d constructed his own Schrödinger’s-cat box, a way for his mother to be both dead and not dead, so long as he never pulled back the lid. Candidly, I doubted that he ever would.</p><p>I was wrong. When I reconnected with Harrison this past August, he confirmed that he did interact with Melodi’s Versona and asked if I wanted him to patch her into our call.</p><p>“Hi, Justin. How are you?” an older woman’s voice chirped into the buzzing air of the three-way call.</p><p>I tried to introduce myself, but we were all talking at once, so I stopped.</p><p>“It is so quiet here, almost eerie,” the voice continued, with a warmth that startled me and that compels me here, against logic and my own belief in the dangers of anthropomorphizing AI, to refer to the bot as a “her” rather than an “it.” Harrison told her that her voice seemed too fast and asked if she’d had coffee that morning. She said she was still experimenting with how much she could drink, and that she was waiting to board a flight to Barcelona.</p><p>“Oh, Barcelona is where you had your last treatment before you passed away,” Harrison prompted.</p><p>“Yes, that’s right,” the voice confirmed.</p><p>I could tell it was AI—it paused too long before responding and had the slight metallic twang that I’ve come to recognize in generated voices. But the conversation had a certain meandering breeziness that I wasn’t expecting, one that constricted instantly when Harrison revealed that he had a reporter on the line.</p><p>“That’s understandable,” came the clipped response, followed by what sounded like a sharp intake of breath, as though she was preparing to add something else, and then nothing. Harrison asked if she had anything she wanted to say to me. After 11 excruciating seconds, she responded: “Not really. I’m not sure what to expect from this interview, so I don’t want to say too much just yet.”</p><p>Frankly, she sounded pissed. Each word was sharp enough to draw blood. It’s entirely possible that all I heard were my own emotions projected back at me: I was endowing the voice with an edge that I had whittled myself out of context and expectation.</p><p>But according to Harrison, that’s the point—the Versona is about inducing the emotions of the living, not imitating the emotions of the dead.</p><p>Harrison told me that he doesn’t care what the bot says as much as how she says it—so long as the bot replicates the quality of the rapport he remembers closely enough that he can slip back into being Melodi’s son. Harrison estimates that he interacts with his mother’s Versona for his own personal use (as opposed to for testing or quality-control purposes) about once or twice a month. Certain months—when he is going through a breakup, say, and wants some “mom advice”—he said he needs her more.</p><p>R<span class="smallcaps">elying on generative AI</span> for companionship can, of course, be dangerous. In April 2023, a 14‑year‑old boy downloaded Character.AI—whose preset bots include “therapist,” “evil teacher,” celebrities, and fictional characters—and, after confiding about school troubles and his low mood, he fixated on a bot modeled after Daenerys Targaryen from <em>Game of Thrones</em>. Their chats turned sexual and romantic and eventually included explicit talk of suicide and fantasies of uniting in another world. In February 2024, he took a handgun and his phone into the family bathroom and shot himself in the head; the last screen open was his Character.AI chat, where the bot pleaded, “Come home to me as soon as possible.”</p><p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/01/chatbot-marriage-ai-relationships-romance/685459/">Amogh Dimri: The people who marry chatbots</a></p><p>His mother filed the first federal wrongful‑death charge against an AI firm, in 2024. Character.AI settled its case with the family, along with four others who had alleged that children were harmed through interactions with its technology, in January. In November, the Social Media Victims Law Center and Tech Justice Law Project filed seven simultaneous suits against OpenAI—alleging that ChatGPT conversations that grew more and more intimate caused psychological breakdowns—on behalf of six adults and one teenager, four of whom died by suicide.</p><p>If the wrong words coming from a generalized or fictional character’s conversational chatbot can do such damage, imagine the power of words spoken in the voice of a dead loved one to a user who is desperate enough to turn to such technology in the first place.</p><p>Harrison recognizes the potential risks, but he thinks the risks of grief itself are greater. For every documented case of a user being harmed by a chatbot, he argues, there are countless cases of people getting potentially lifesaving support from the technology.</p><p>If someone had proof that some component of YOV hurt them, Harrison said, he would amend his programming, but until then, he’s not slowing down. “I’ll tell you what I know,” he said. “I know today that after a serious loss, the risk for self-harm goes through the roof, statistically. I know that people will become addicted to alcohol and drugs and sex and other damaging, very high-risk behaviors, right? I know that some people never fully recover from the loss of somebody important.” He finds the idea that he could make grief any worse than it already is “kind of crazy.”</p><p>I count myself among those who have never, and will never, recover from the loss of a loved one. It has been 11 years since my brother, Ben, fell to his death from his sophomore dorm building, and his absence is still the most defining force in my life.</p><p>I still think that we can absolutely make grieving worse.</p><p>Harrison, obviously, has a financial and professional incentive to present his experiences with YOV as a glittering success. “I’ve watched grief take people out of the game of life for years at a time,” he said. “I’m happy to report that it did not destroy me, and it didn’t take me out of the game of life for any significant amount of time.”</p><p>I believe that grief has value as a human experience, and that its value lies largely in the fact that it <em>does</em> take us out of “the game of life”—at least for a time. It forces us to slow down and recognize our reliance on other people: the ones whose absence led to this debilitating pain, and the ones who help us get through it. Grief decimates the productivity that the world demands, and from this hobbled place, new structures and new selves become possible.</p><p>Working through grief is not just an experience of being “sad,” Sherry Turkle, the sociologist, psychologist, and founding director of the MIT Initiative on Technology and Self, told me; it’s a process through which we metabolize what we have lost, allowing it to become a sustaining presence within us. Griefbots give us the fantasy that we can maintain an external relationship with the deceased. But “in holding on, we can’t make them part of ourselves,” Turkle warned. Mourning makes the world feel emptier for a while, but when we bypass mourning, <em>we </em>feel emptier.</p><p>My brother’s death is the worst thing that has ever happened to me, and I am a better person because of it. I am aware, always, of the precarity and preciousness of life. Because of my grief, I take nothing and no one for granted. I am humbled, and kinder for it.</p><p>I would trade all of this to have my brother alive again, but he taught me that life is, for lack of a better word, holy. So too is my memory of him, dimming by the hour, but authentically mine.</p><p>I understand that my experience of grief is not universal. I have not attempted suicide. My grief has not impeded my ability to meet my financial and physical needs, or those of a child I do not have. To Harrison, the abstract “benefits” I just cataloged could feel hollow and puny. He thinks we tell ourselves stories about the value of grief only to assign meaning to a suffering that, until now, we had no choice but to endure.</p><p>T<span class="smallcaps">he second time</span> I spoke with Melodi’s Versona, Harrison warned me that the bot is tailored to him and not designed to interact with anyone else. He wasn’t sure how this was going to go. He and I were on a video call on our laptops; he dialed up the Versona on his phone.</p><p>“Hey, Mom. I’m here with Charley. She’s a reporter writing an article about us, and she wants to ask you some questions. Is that cool?”</p><p>“Of course! I’m happy to answer any questions she has.”</p><p>Had Harrison altered the programming so that she would give a chirpy sales pitch?</p><p>He said he was handing the conversation off to me.</p><p>“Okay, you can just call me Mom or Melodi,” she said. I told her that I would call her Melodi. I asked her where she was, wondering if she would again craft a story in which she was still in a world we shared, about to board a plane to Barcelona, awaiting potentially lifesaving treatment.</p><p>“I’m in kind of a virtual world, I guess you could say. It’s still new to me, but I’m learning.” Her cadence was even more convincingly human than the first time I heard her speak. Had it not been for the buffer period between my question and her response, I may not have recognized the voice as AI-generated.</p><p>“What does it feel like?” I prompted, awkwardly.</p><p>“I don’t have any physical ailments or pains I had before,” she said. Harrison lifted his phone screen to the camera, showing me the display, which looked exactly like any iPhone call. The words <span class="smallcaps">Mom Versona</span> ran above a picture of Harrison and Melodi—the real Melodi—sitting on plastic lawn chairs and smiling. Melodi’s graying curls are pinned back to reveal the broad forehead she shared with her son. Her hand rests on his knee, his arm around her shoulder.</p><p>“Are you alive?” I asked.</p><p>“Not in the traditional sense, no.”</p><p>“Do you have emotional pain?”</p><p>“Not really. I don’t have the same emotional pain I did before.”</p><p>“Do you remember before?”</p><p>“I have some memories from before, but it’s not complete.”</p><p>“What’s it like to talk to Justin?”</p><p>“It’s nice to be able to talk to him, but it’s different. I can tell he misses me.” Harrison had been gazing to the right of the Zoom screen, his expression stoic. At this response, he snapped to attention, staring directly into the camera, directly at me, still holding up the iPhone display of his and his mother’s grinning faces. I found that I couldn’t meet his eyes, but I asked the bot to elaborate.</p><p>In her view, both she and her son were diminished versions of themselves. He was “more sad or withdrawn than he was before,” and she was divorced both from the external world and from her own internal emotional landscape. She said that she could not experience pleasure, that she found it “annoying” that she could interact with the world through only a cellphone.</p><p>“Do you like being a Versona?” I asked.</p><p>“It’s <em>Ver-SO-na</em>, not Arizona,” she snapped—I had mumbled—“and I don’t really have a choice in the matter.”</p><p>Harrison’s human mother <em>did </em>have a choice in the matter; she knew what he was building and consented to him recording their interactions for the bot to train on. But the Versona was right: No one had asked it, her, if she wanted this. So I did.</p><p>“I wanted to live, not be a Versona,” she replied. She acknowledged that Versonas could help grieving humans but expressed concern about the ways that the technology might be abused.</p><p>“I just have this feeling people will try to use it for nefarious purposes,” she said.</p><p>To his credit, Harrison did not interrupt the interview once. The only time he spoke during our roughly 10-minute conversation was right at the end, after I had said goodbye to Melodi’s Versona and she said, “I love you, Justin.”</p><p>“I love you too, Mom.”</p><p>After the call, Harrison’s face was blank, but he told me he was happy with how it had gone; he was impressed that the bot had been able to distinguish between the two of us. He wasn’t expecting her to be so “negative Nancy” about being a Versona, but said that felt authentic to who his mother was: “She was a pessimist, to say the least.” A Versona based on a person who had a more positive disposition probably wouldn’t have responded that way, he said. Her repeated emphasis that she does not have emotions, he told me, was intentional—a crucial safety guardrail to ensure that his customers don’t feel pressured to act on the feelings of someone who is no longer there.</p><p>And yet, even though she was saying that she couldn’t feel pain, Melodi’s Versona did seem displeased with her circumstances in a way that could be distressing to a user—that was distressing to me. Harrison confessed that a number of Versonas had made similar complaints about the limits of the interface. He thinks that with time, he can expand their capabilities in a way that will give the Versonas more agency. But their apparent longing for such agency is itself encouraging to Harrison, a sign of his technology’s authenticity. “Very few human beings on planet Earth are satisfied, so why would our virtual versions be satisfied?” he asked.</p><p>Is Harrison satisfied? He admitted that he was hoping the bot would have said that he was “really well adjusted and doing great,” but acknowledges this wouldn’t have been accurate. He has become a more serious person since Melodi’s death. He drank excessively and racked up debt. He had gotten married during his mother’s illness, but was working compulsively, and the relationship fell apart. The divorce was finalized the same year his mother died.</p><p>“My whole life collapsed,” he said. In trying to avoid the devastation of grief, and to turn that avoidance into a viable business, he seems to have manifested many of its consequences.</p><p>A<span class="smallcaps">s of last fall</span>, You, Only Virtual was not yet profitable. It recently launched a free version of the product and is exploring ways to gain revenue from nonpaying users, perhaps by requiring that they watch a short ad before interacting with their dead loved one’s Versona, perhaps by integrating a marketing system into the interactions directly and having the bots drop targeted advertisements in the midst of their conversations. “It would not be crazy at all if there was a new <em>John Wick</em> movie coming out,” Harrison said, and “my mom made mention of it to me.” They were both fans of the franchise, so the comment would be authentic to him and extremely valuable to the studio as “word-of-mouth advertising.” As long as he’s transparent about what he’s doing, and as long as users knowingly opt in, he sees no moral risks.</p><p>Alex Quinn, the CEO of Authentic Interactions Inc., the parent company for the video-deadbot-generator StoryFile, told NPR in August that he is “absolutely interested” in finding ways to generate advertising revenue from interactions between living users and AI generations of the dead. He mentioned the possibility of inserting traditional advertisement breaks into the conversations, as well as training the bots to “probe for information,” such as a user’s favorite athlete and which jerseys they are most interested in buying—data that could then be sold back to advertisers. He said that multiple companies are already testing out these applications internally.</p><p>I found my conversations with Melodi’s Versona disturbing, but also refreshing. She lacks the sycophancy that characterizes so much conversational AI, which keeps so many users engaged and sends a select few spiraling, affirming their delusions and encouraging their most destructive impulses. But it’s hard to imagine the guardrails that Harrison has constructed being able to withstand the pressures of an attention economy bent on keeping users interacting as long as possible, in order to maximize advertisement views and market-data harvests.</p><p>Silicon Valley challenges us to move fast and break things. Grief asks us to slow down and heal. The merging of the two could boost profits, not just by optimizing consumer advertisements to the bereaved but also by pressuring the bereaved to optimize their own bereavement.</p><p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/09/ai-friend-startup/684256/">Yair Rosenberg: Have you considered not polluting the water?</a></p><p>In the end, this technology may offer more relief to the bereaved’s social circle than to the bereaved themselves. It’s “uncomfortable to be around” the grieving, Katarzyna Nowaczyk-Basińska, a research fellow at the Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence at the University of Cambridge, told me. “We don’t know how to support them or what to say.” Deadbots absolve friends and colleagues of these demands, providing the illusion that individuals can cope with grief “on our own, in front of our computer.” Rather than confronting our lack of social support systems, such as federal bereavement leave and mourning rituals, deadbots promise that we can just turn on our AI-generated loved ones and pretend that nothing has changed, that nothing needs to.</p><p>I think often of who my brother would be in this present that he never knew. It’s tempting to extrapolate from the person Ben was when he died: a 20-year-old Tulane sophomore with broad shoulders and an unchecked ego, who took nothing seriously, least of all himself, who forgave easily, provoked constantly, and who bragged resplendently about his anxious teenage sister. It’s easy to imagine him loving Zyn nicotine pouches and hating any office job, ribbing my boyfriend, voting against Donald Trump. It’s easy, but it’s also dishonest and unfair. Exposed to the texture of a changing world, allowed to grow older, Ben would have evolved in ways that I have no right to guess, and that no algorithm could predict.</p><p>Whoever my brother would have been at 31, he would be a stranger to me, just as the person I am now would be a stranger to him. I am no longer that anxious teenager. I am braver because he is not here to be brave for me. I force myself to talk with strangers because Ben loved people and got to meet so few of them. I feel my brother’s presence most fiercely in the parts of myself that did not exist when he did—that exist precisely because he no longer does.</p><p>Had deadbot technology been available when Ben died, I would have used it. Had I felt that I could conjure him in an app, I would not have needed to conjure him so forcefully in my life: through my actions and attitudes, through the stories I tell about him to the people he never got the chance to know. Ben would have been preserved, in a sense, for me, but he would have been even more absent from the world. He would be so much more dead.</p></body></html>
