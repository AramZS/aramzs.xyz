<p>The First Amendment protects five things: religion, speech, the press, assembly and petition. The press is the only private enterprise explicitly named in the Constitution — not as a commercial interest to be protected but as a democratic function to be preserved. The press made that list because an informed citizenry is a prerequisite for self-governance.</p>
<p>A press that informs the wealthy while leaving others in darkness is not the press the Constitution envisions. The press freedom clause is from a time when newspapers often advocated revolution. The era’s journalism was intended to reach the people, not just the ruling class.</p>
<p>Almost two centuries later, Judge Murray Gurfein famously <a data-cms-ai="0" href="https://www.nytimes.com/1979/12/18/archives/judge-gurfeins-first-case.html">said</a><u>,</u> “A cantankerous press, an obstinate press, a ubiquitous press must be suffered by those in authority in order to preserve … the right of the people to know.”</p>
<p>The free press cannot be ubiquitous behind a paywall. A recent <a data-cms-ai="0" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Chj__TSiC_U&amp;t=10s&amp;themeRefresh=1">online event</a> featuring the editors of Wired and 404 Media hosted by Freedom of the Press Foundation, where I’m a founding board member, previewed a better way. It turns out “unpaywalling” is good not only for democracy but for business.</p>
<p>It’s not going to solve all of journalism’s problems — the industry is in a rough place with outlets barely scraping by, regardless of paywalls. But whatever business model journalism settles on is sure to depend on public trust. Paywalls undermine that trust.</p>
<h3>Two-tiered citizenry</h3>
<p>Paywalls create a two-tiered citizenry — one that can afford to be informed and one that cannot. Those most likely to be surveilled, policed, detained and deported are least able to afford subscriptions.</p>
<p>During Operation Midway Blitz, the impacted communities needed basic information: What were their rights? Who had been taken? Where? Were immigration authorities lying?</p>
<p>Chicago is lucky. Chicago Public Media (which owns the Chicago Sun-Times), the Reader, Unraveled Press, the Triibe, Block Club Chicago and others offered excellent nonpaywalled reporting about ICE’s invasion to all Chicagoans, whether at a coffee shop in Lincoln Park or dodging white supremacist federal goons in Back of the Yards.</p>
<p>Otherwise, those who needed news most would be out of luck. The median household income in Brighton Park — which was heavily targeted by ICE — is under $45,000. For a family deciding between groceries and a newspaper subscription, information loses.</p>
<p>Hopefully, Chicagoans in a position to support nonprofit and nonpaywalled news outlets will now see their benefits more clearly, and fund them, so we retain our privileged position in a country full of news deserts.</p>
<p>But the next city ICE invades may not be so fortunate. The results can be perverse; those with the greatest stake in accountability journalism are systematically excluded from it.</p>
<h3>Public records, private access</h3>
<p>There’s a particular irony when FOIA-based reporting — the kind that will expose the corruption and incompetence behind ICE’s abduction spree — ends up behind a paywall.</p>
<p>The federal Freedom of Information Act and its state counterparts exist because the public owns government records. We fund their creation. When a journalist files a FOIA request, fights for compliance, and finally publishes a story, it’s the product of public investment at every stage. It exists because the law recognizes our right to know.</p>
<p>When the story goes behind a paywall, that right becomes a privilege.</p>
<p>Wired and 404 — both for-profit outlets — recognized this reality and unpaywalled public records-based reporting. Katie Drummond, global editorial director of Wired (and also a Freedom of the Press Foundation board member), said Wired “made a calculated bet that our audience would show up for us,” which paid off “above and beyond what I could have possibly imagined. The changes Wired made in March led to a “huge increase in subscribers.”</p>
<p>It’s great that Wired’s announcement got attention and drove revenue. Other for-profit outlets should follow. And nonprofit outlets like those in Chicago that don’t paywall any stories, Freedom of Information Act-based or otherwise, should be similarly rewarded.</p>
<p>Journalism’s effectiveness often depends on reach. A scoop about corruption reaching 10,000 paying subscribers is a problem for the government to manage. One reaching a million citizens is a crisis that demands a response.</p>
<p>And reach begets more reach. 404 co-founder Joseph Cox said free access to the outlet’s public records reporting has led to local journalists “doing basically the same public records request, but for their own communities.”</p>
<p>Paywalls don’t just limit the reach of news; they create a void often filled by lies and deceit. People read and share unverified social media reports — some wildly wrong — not because they’re good, but because they’re free. And those misinformation purveyors have a vested interest in convincing their audience that real news isn’t worth paying for.</p>
<p>The only way to rebuild the public’s dwindling trust in the media is to show the public: “This is what we do and why we matter.”</p>
<p>Paywalls capture the already converted. Paywall-free news earns the trust of everyone else.</p>
