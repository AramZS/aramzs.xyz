<p>GQ recently ran an <a href="https://www.gq.com/story/why-my-2026-resolution-is-to-start-drinking-again">essay</a> from writer Dean Stattmann about attempting to go alcohol-free. Stattmann swore off booze last summer and found himself clearer-eyed, with a healthier body and bank account, but also … a little glum. He kept his run club and regular pickup soccer game, and still went out to dinner with his wife. But he missed some of the fun that comes from knocking back a beer with a friend, impulsively deciding on karaoke, going to the proverbial second location. He became, he says, a bit of a bummer. So instead of embracing a dry January for 2026, he decided to ditch ditching booze. That is: He resumed drinking.</p>
<p>Which, go for it, man. Things are bleak, <a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2020/01/2020-skip-resolutions-embrace-a-vice.html">grab a little liquid joy while you’re here</a>. But just in case he wanted another option, I have a secret to let Stattman and everyone else in on. There is a way to do this sans booze. (This is not an essay about sobriety or harm reduction, both of which are great.) A way that will keep your head clear in the morning. A way that brings a little spark of sunshine to your outing. A subtle, ineffable looseness that will not incapacitate you.</p>
<p>Let me introduce you to the 1-milligram edible. The 1-milligram edible is a thing of beauty: just enough THC to take the edge off your middle-aged back pain, not enough to send you out for a pint of Talenti. The 1-milligram edible can get you through a holiday with extended family, make your mental-health walk better, or quiet the horrifying drumbeat of authoritarianism. If you’re an adult in an otherwise healthy relationship with substances, here I am telling you to do drugs. Just a little.</p>
<p>I have never been a real stoner. My attempts in high school and college were of the furtive, throat-burning variety. I believe a Coke-can-as-makeshift-bong was involved. Probably some very low-quality weed, too. I was too much of a Goody Two-Shoes to really investigate.</p>
<p>I embraced the 1-milligram edible in adulthood. Weed is legal in New York, where I live. And while it wasn’t a regular pastime, I had the odd edible every now and then. But what I found is that they often made me <em>too</em> high. Five milligrams and I was interrogating a liberal pundit at a party about his thoughts on aliens (it’s drones, come on). Then, I got pregnant and breastfed—no weed for me. Sometime around 2022, the algorithm got me and served me an ad for “<a href="https://roselosangeles.com/products/strawberry-singles">Strawberry Singles</a>,” a product tailor-made for lightweights like me. I ordered them and tucked them away.</p>
<p>Then, when I was diagnosed with early-stage lung cancer just before Christmas in 2023, they rode to my rescue. On Dec. 23, I learned that the cancer was contained and manageable, but that I would need surgery soon. But … I couldn’t schedule said surgery or even start talking to surgeons until after the new year. That left me heading into a family holiday recovering from a biopsy, with my husband and 3-year-old, while a 6-foot-high neon sign screaming “CANCER! CANCER! CANCER!” went off in my brain. As I packed to head to my mother’s house, the little pink box of edibles was the first thing in my suitcase.</p>
<p>Being plunged into the world of cancer was a bit like snorkeling (go with me here). My 48-year-old life existed in this beautiful, mundane, above-water plane, filled with work and marriage and family and the kind of things we should all be thankful for, even if we aren’t always. But a cancer diagnosis, even an early-stage one like mine, renders death visible. You have put on your mask and snorkel and stared into another realm. And it is teeming, not with fish and coral, but blood panels and pulmonary function tests and Cassandra the nurse manager from Aetna calling to review your benefits. It’s a world you always knew existed, but maybe luck or privilege let you avoid facing it directly. One of my doctors shared a line by physician <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1813683">Susan Levenstein</a> that has stayed with me: “Our everyday living depends on a fiction of invulnerability which when breached leaves us crippled with fear.” It is a lot to contemplate while you are trying to make a gingerbread house. The edibles made me lighter. Able to fill a stocking without crying. To play a game of tag in the snow. To let down some of the fierce protective armor that was necessary to slog to diagnosis.</p>
<p>Now that I am two years out from surgery, I still recommend the edibles. Not so much as a “holy shit what is happening to me” tool; that’s what oncology, therapy, and exercise are for. But for a fun escape with minimal downside. A pleasant warmth spreading through your midsection. You will relax, you will smile, you will endure <em>Disney on Ice</em>. And crucially, you will have no hangover. Somewhere around 45 I lost the ability to drink more than 1.5 glasses of wine without next-day pain. No such issue here!</p>
<p>A teeny tiny bit of THC is where it’s at. If you need to snap back into grownup mode, no problem. It is literally impossible to<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/04/opinion/dowd-dont-harsh-our-mellow-dude.html"> accidentally Maureen Dowd</a> yourself. But it’s just enough for 90 minutes of solitude. A moment when my brain can turn off thinking about whether we need paper towels or my various crushing sandwich-generation duties, <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2026/01/renee-good-killing-ice-watch-mom.html">or how a parent was just murdered by the state</a>, on camera. When I told one of my doctors about this occasional coping mechanism, he offered to get me a medical marijuana card so I could have a higher dose.</p>
<p>But I’m happy with my milligram. I’m a parent, I’m a reporter, I don’t want to <em>completely</em> dissociate from reality, that feels too irresponsible for me. I don’t drink much, since alcohol is a carcinogen. But do I want to go to Pilates and slightly lose track of my legs? You bet. If you doubt that a single milligram of THC does anything, trust me: Pilates hurts more without it.</p>
