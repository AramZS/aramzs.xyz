<h2>Build community, bring snacks, and other tips from an occupied city</h2>
<p><em><strong>Hello, Snackers and new readers. </strong><em>I live in Minneapolis. I need to say some things. </em></em></p>
<p><em>This is all very dashed-off and raw; apologies for any typos and the lack of tidy thoughts and fully-formed arguments. </em></p>
<p><em><strong>If you’re new here,</strong> Snack Stack is USUALLY an obsessively researched newsletter about the cultural history of snacks and other foods around the world. Longtime readers know I get political and personal sometimes, like <a href="https://snackstack.net/2022/01/12/the-snack-that-comforts-me/">the one about nachos and Covid</a> or <a href="https://snackstack.net/2024/11/09/this-was-supposed-to-be-about-potato-chips/">the one about potato chips and the 2024 election</a>. Here we go again. </em></p>

<p>I live in Minneapolis. South Side. It’s worse than you’ve heard. But also, weirdly, better.</p>
<p>Federal agents are currently occupying my city, the place where I was born and raised. They’re in my neighborhood and in all the other neighborhoods. It’s both a big city and a very small town, and all the streetscapes you’ve seen on the news are places I know well.</p>
<p>I assume you’ve heard, by now, about <a href="https://people.com/liam-conejo-ramos-ill-fever-ice-detention-center-11894992">five-year-old Liam</a>, the little boy in the cute blue hat, and <a href="https://people.com/ice-sends-minnesota-man-and-his-toddler-2-to-texas-detention-center-against-judge-orders-report-11891939">two-year-old Chloe</a>, detained with her dad on their way home from the grocery store, the sort of mundane activity of daily life that everyone reading this has done a thousand times.</p>
<p>I assume you understand that their stories–and Alex Pretti and Renee Good and the other Minnesotans whose names and faces have made headlines around the world–are but a small fraction of the detentions and assaults and harassment of everyday people across this city, this state, this country.</p>
<p>I assume you know that Minneapolis and St. Paul have organized to support their neighbors. Again, the published news accounts are barely a starting point. Drive around town on a weekday and you’ll see parents and community members in high-viz vests outside schools. I don’t mean some schools, I mean <em>all </em>of them. Preschools, too. (Consider the bleakness of that.) Sometimes I’m out there in my own orange vest. Sometimes I’m doing other things we can’t discuss, all entirely legal and helpful, just neighbors helping neighbors in routine ways that have suddenly become dangerous because armed goons, sent by a wannabe dictator, have invaded our city.</p>
<p>The fear is ever-present. I habitually scan every intersection for convoys of SUVs. My phone dings all day with updates from my neighborhood. I am constantly terrified that my friends and neighbors and fellow community members will be attacked or worse.</p>
<p>It’s exhausting enough for a middle-aged white dude operating on easy mode, and I know it’s many levels worse for others. I do what I can to take on a bit of the burden. I can add tasks to my day if it helps my neighbors safe. They help me jump my car on the coldest days; my kids play with theirs; we get through life together.</p>
<p>There’s lots to say about all this. I’ve pitched stories to other outlets and hope to have something up soon, and there are plenty of tales I won’t be able to tell for years, if ever.</p>
<p>But here’s something I wanted to say in this little newsletter. It’s about cookies and how you can help your own community.</p>
<p>I have received so many emails and texts from friends and acquaintances around the world, to the point that I now have a cut-and-paste response. If you want to help us, check out <a href="https://www.standwithminnesota.com/">the website Stand With Minnesota</a>, which has links to many organizations, GoFundMes, and other ways to chip in a few bucks. Call your Senators and Congresspeople and anyone else and tell them that ICE needs to get the fuck out of Minnesota because they’re making our lives miserable and dangerous. (Apologies to any kids reading this; I’ve told my daughters that this is one of the very rare times that it’s okay to swear.)</p>
<p>But also: Start doing the work now to organize <em>your </em>community and protect <em>your </em>neighbors. If ICE isn’t already there, they will be soon, or at least some other hardship will come your way, because this is the cruel reality of life.</p>
<p>Much of the communication in Minneapolis piggybacks on the block club group texts and neighborhood watches we set up in May 2020, after the police killed George Floyd and <a href="https://theintercept.com/2020/06/12/minneapolis-george-floyd-police-abolition-community-defense/">things got weird</a>. Even so, energizing those chats and setting up actual organizational systems has all been done on an ad-hoc basis, all of us using our skills to make it up as we go along.</p>
<p>Everyone I know is involved in some way, large or small, and the roles break down into three loose categories: confrontation, coordination, and cookies.</p>
<p><strong>Confrontation </strong>is the most public. ICE watch members drive around town following agents. <a href="https://mndaily.com/top-story/dozens-detained-outside-of-graduate-hotel-wednesday-night-following-protest/01/29/2026/">Protesters show up at hotels</a>, <a href="https://kstp.com/kstp-news/local-news/99-cited-in-clergy-led-anti-ice-protest-at-msp-airport-that-ended-with-mass-arrests/">at the airport</a>, and at the <a href="https://www.scrippsnews.com/politics/immigration/protests-boycotts-sweep-us-amid-minneapolis-immigration-enforcement-surge">now-infamous Whipple Building</a>, where agents take detainees. And everyone–servers at the local bistro, librarians, museum desk staff, gift shop cashiers, <em>everyone</em>–carries whistles, ready to make noise if they see something.</p>
<p><strong>Coordination </strong>is all the support, not just for ICE watch but (even more so) for mutual aid. Many neighbors, including plenty who are citizens or otherwise have legal status but also aren’t white or have a particular accent, are scared to go out of their homes right now, for understandable reasons. Friends and neighbors and school groups help do loads of laundry, deliver groceries, and raise funds to help cover the rent. Thousands upon thousands of Twin Cities residents are using (or building) their skills with spreadsheets and project management to work behind the scenes and keep their community intact. <a href="https://www.npr.org/2026/01/21/nx-s1-5682120/12-year-old-immigrant-need-minneapolis-launched-underground-operation">One of the most heartbreaking stories I have read in the last few weeks is this NPR story about the coordinated effort to deliver menstrual pads to a 12-year-old girl. </a> Again, there are a thousand stories like this that remain untold. The scope of heartbreak and quiet violence is unimaginable.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies </strong>are the small things that offer a bit of joy. Even in rough times, we have to appreciate the little things. I’ve written about this repeatedly, but one reason I loves snacks is that they aren’t just survival food–they’re a pause in the day, a little boost to the spirit, <em>comfort </em>in the form of a few tasty bites.</p>
<p>It’s not just cookies, of course; it’s any form of low-lift comfort.</p>
<p>The other day, I was at my older daughter’s school and someone mentioned that the Parent Teacher Organization had purchased taco platters for teachers and staff to eat for lunch. It was both support for a struggling business (a <em>lot </em>of immigrant-run restaurants are closed or keep their doors locked, opening them only for known customers) and a treat for the people who keep our kids safe, happy, and educated.</p>
<p>In the past few weeks, I’ve heard so many people say that they just don’t know how to start with community-building. My advice: bake cookies.</p>
<p>Offer a small gesture of comfort and appreciation to neighbors or the local school.</p>
<p>Food is not just sustenance; it’s a symbol of kinship and values, has been for ages. Let us break bread together, <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/blog/food-matters/culture-of-resistance-protesting-greecee28099s-politics-with-yogurt/">let us protest with Greek yogurt</a> and <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/argentina-pastries-political">Argentinian pastries</a>, <a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/news/black-communities-food-as-protest">let us hold bake sales during the Montgomery bus boycott</a>.</p>
<p>Standing up for your community doesn’t have to involve being in the streets. If you can follow a recipe, you can offer a much-needed gesture of support, a treat for someone who desperately needs it.</p>
<p>I’m certain actual activists or social scientists have an existing name for this sort of thing, but I’m calling it the Cookie Theory of Collective Action: <em>Everyone has a role, anyone can start small, and joy is an essential part of the broader fight for your community.</em></p>
<p>I went to the big march through downtown Minneapolis last week, along with 50,000 of my closest friends, on a day when the temperatures were well below zero. There were endless signs and chats, of course, but also plenty of people giving out handwarmers or cups of hot cocoa and tea; a group of Somali women offered <a href="https://amiraspantry.com/arabian-sambosak-a-k-a-samosa/">sambusas</a> to grateful passersby; a young white hippie ladled soup into plastic cups for anyone who wanted some (I saw no takers but appreciated his effort).</p>
<p>These are the gestures that build trust and social networks and quality of life. Little things that, taken together, help lift the weight of the world.</p>
<p>You know why the Twin Cities have been so effective in standing up to ICE? Because it’s all hands on deck, relentlessly and in many ways, using what little bits of time and energy and lived experience that we can offer.</p>
<p>Again: just neighbors helping neighbors. If we can do it, so can you.</p>
<p>Obviously, a batch of cookies is just the starting point. If you can do one dozen, make another. While you’re at the store, grab a few extra items for the food shelf. Every little bit helps. Ask your neighbors if they need anything while you’re out. Start conversations.</p>
<p>Cookies are never enough on their own. But they are, in their own way, essential. Go bake some. Go build your community.</p>
