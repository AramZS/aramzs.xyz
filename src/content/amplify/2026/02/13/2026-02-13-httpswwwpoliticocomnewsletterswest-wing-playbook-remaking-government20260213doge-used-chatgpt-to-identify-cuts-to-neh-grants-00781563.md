<p>DOGE representatives allegedly used ChatGPT to identify approximately 1,400 National Endowment for the Humanities grants related to diversity that were terminated in April of last year, according to a new court filing released today.</p>
<p>The suit before Judge <b>COLLEEN McMAHON</b> of the Southern District of New York, filed in May by The Authors Guild, a group that advocates for published authors, asserts that DOGE and NEH did not have the authority to make the cuts, which they argue were in violation of the First Amendment.</p>
<p>A new filing in the case today asserts that two DOGE staffers plugged in NEH grants to ChatGPT asking it to flag which are related to diversity, equity and inclusion issues. The prompts given by the DOGE staffers were brief and unspecific, asking it to tell in less than 140 characters why the grants are DEI.</p>
<p>The plaintiffs argue that ChatGPT then narrowed the active grants down to approximately 1,400 that it determined were related to DEI, based on their findings, which they allege were signed by <b>MICHAEL McDONALD</b>, the then-acting chair of the NEH.</p>
<p>They were then terminated.</p>
<p>It’s the latest in a raft of revelations suggesting that <b>ELON MUSK</b>’s cost-cutting squad, which ripped through the federal government early last year, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/02/06/elon-musk-doge-ai-department-education/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">used AI to recommend cuts</a> related to certain subjects such as DEI or climate change. Lawmakers have complained bitterly about DOGE’s blunt-force cuts, which sometimes had to be reversed — and, more broadly, agencies’ attempts to shut off or redirect money for programs lawfully appropriated by Congress.</p>
<p>The new filing reveals details about how DOGE staff went about the task of identifying and cutting programs with the help of ChatGPT.</p>
<p>According to a preliminary injunction from McMahon in July, once ChatGPT had assigned each project a label “to indicate whether and to what extent the grantee’s project appeared to fall afoul” of the anti-DEI executive orders signed by President <b>DONALD TRUMP</b> early last year, McDonald said he “more broadly chose grants for termination.”</p>
<p>The evidence released today was attained through the discovery process after McMahon compelled the government to do so in December.</p>
<p>Among the terminated grants, which have not been previously reported, were a film analyzing how baseball helped heal frictions between the U.S. and Japan caused by World War I; a documentary titled “The Untold Story of Jewish Women Slave Labor in the Holocaust;” a film focused on the Colfax massacre of 1873, where dozens of Black men were murdered by a mob of Confederate soldiers and Ku Klux Klan members; and a film about the first female pilots to fly for the U.S. military during World War II.</p>

<h2>POTUS PUZZLER </h2>
<p>Which former president struggled to put on his poncho during a presidential inauguration?</p>
<p>(Answer at bottom.)</p>
<h2>WHO'S IN, WHO'S OUT</h2>
<p><b>RFK RIDIN’ SOLO: </b>Deputy HHS Secretary <b>JIM O’NEILL</b> and General Counsel <b>MIKE STUART</b> will leave their current roles as part of <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/12/rfk-jr-shakes-up-leadership-team-00779554">a larger shakeup</a> of health department leadership, according to HHS officials and a person familiar with the personnel decision granted anonymity to discuss the moves, our <b>DAVID LIM</b> and <b>TIM RÖHN</b> <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/13/top-aides-to-rfk-jr-will-leave-posts-00780125">report</a>. “They are being offered jobs within the administration but will not be remaining in their current positions,” the person familiar told POLITICO.</p>
<p>HHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, HHS Secretary <b>ROBERT F. KENNEDY JR. </b>announced <b>CHRIS KLOMP</b>, deputy administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, would become chief counselor in charge of overseeing all HHS operations. He also elevated <b>KYLE DIAMANTAS</b> and <b>GRACE GRAHAM </b>to senior counselors for the Food and Drug Administration. They will retain their prior roles as deputy commissioner for human foods and deputy commissioner for policy, legislation and international affairs, respectively. <b>JOHN BROOKS</b> will also become a senior counselor at CMS in addition to his job as chief of staff and regulatory officer.</p>
<p><b>FROM WASHINGTON TO ALBANY? MARC MOLINARO</b> intends to depart the Trump administration and run for an upstate Assembly district, our <b>NICK REISMAN</b> <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/new-york-playbook/2026/02/13/dems-palantir-problem-00779888">reports</a>. Molinaro, the current administrator of the Federal Transit Administration, is eyeing a seat being vacated by Republican Assemblymember <b>CHRIS TAGUE</b>, who is running for the state Senate. Molinaro, a former congressmember in Upstate New York, joined the administration in 2025 after losing his reelection bid to Democrat <b>JOSH RILEY</b> in one of the closest races in the country.</p>
<h2>Agenda Setting</h2>
<p><b>FOLLOWING THE MONEY: </b>The White House budget office is using millions of dollars from the former U.S. foreign aid agency to pay for security detail for <b>RUSS VOUGHT</b>, the Office of Management and Budget director and architect of the administration’s move to cut thousands of government jobs, Reuters’ <b>JONATHAN LANDAY</b> and <b>DOUGLAS GILLISON</b> <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/white-house-uses-usaid-funds-budget-director-voughts-security-documents-show-2026-02-13/">report</a>. OMB is allocating $15 million of what remains of USAID operating expenses to cover the costs of his protection by the U.S. Marshals Service through the end of 2026, according to documents seen by Reuters.</p>
<p>A person familiar with the matter said Vought’s security detail comprises more than a dozen U.S. Marshals, which Reuters could not independently confirm. OMB did not make Vought available for an interview.</p>
<p>Asked about the use of USAID funds, OMB spokesperson <b>RACHEL CAULEY</b> said in an email: “We are going to continue to use available funds at the three agencies overseen by the director to protect him,” apparently referring to OMB, USAID and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, of which Vought is the acting director.</p>
<p>The person familiar with the matter said Vought has received serious threats, which the person said were apparently linked to his role as a leading author of Project 2025, the conservative blueprint undergirding many administration policies. Reuters was not able to independently confirm the threats or whether they related to Project 2025.</p>
<p><b>MOVING FORWARD … TO AN UNCERTAIN FATE: </b>Treasury Secretary <b>SCOTT BESSENT</b> said today that he expects the Senate Banking Committee to begin processing <b>KEVIN WARSH</b>’s Federal Reserve chair nomination, despite Sen. <b>THOM TILLIS</b>’ (R-N.C.) vow to block any central bank nominee until the DOJ ends an investigation into current Chair <b>JEROME POWELL</b>, our <b>JASPER GOODMAN</b> <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/13/bessent-warsh-fed-nomination-00780122">reports</a>.</p>
<p>Tillis doubled down on his stance today in Munich, <a href="https://x.com/BloombergTV/status/2022333374946283594">telling Bloomberg</a> he has “no intention” of allowing any nominee to move forward “until this matter is settled,” adding it is “foundational to Fed independence, and I for one am going to stand on the side of certainty, and Fed independence is what delivers certainty in our markets.”</p>
<p><b>BENCHED: </b>When Energy Secretary <b>CHRIS WRIGHT</b> empowered five researchers to produce a government report critical of mainstream climate science last summer, it was a watershed moment for a once fringe corner of the scientific community. But the intervening months have been difficult for the group, POLITICO’s E&amp;E News’ <b>SCOTT WALDMAN</b> <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/13/trump-sidelines-climate-contrarians-science-rollback-00779098">reports</a>. The team published a 141-page report that downplayed the threat of a warmer planet, but its analysis has taken fire from every corner.</p>
<p>Internal DOE scientists criticized it. Outside climate scientists skewered it. And the group was the subject of a lawsuit from public interest groups. On Thursday, when the administration announced its decision to eliminate a bedrock of U.S. climate policy — the so-called endangerment finding — it didn’t employ the group’s arguments that the science underpinning current climate policy is wrong.</p>
<p>A final version of the rule, released late Thursday, confirmed EPA would not rely on the DOE report “for any aspect of this final action,” suggesting the agency and the White House are unwilling to risk a court battle over climate science.</p>
<p>None of the five researchers who wrote the DOE report agreed to an interview with POLITICO’s E&amp;E News. But one of them, <b>JUDITH CURRY</b>, a former climate scientist at Georgia Tech, defended the group’s work in a statement and disputed the notion there was a consensus in climate science. “Politicized science and a manufactured consensus on complex and deeply uncertain science will invariably mislead policy makers and lead to poor policy making,” Curry told E&amp;E News on Thursday.</p>
<h2>In the Courts</h2>
<p><b>STRETCHING THE TRUTH:</b> Two federal officers appear to have lied about an incident last month in Minneapolis that ended with one of them shooting a Venezuelan immigrant in the leg, ICE Acting Director <b>TODD LYONS</b> said today, our <b>KYLE CHENEY</b> and <b>JOSH GERSTEIN</b> <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/13/ice-minneapolis-shooting-assault-00780839">report</a>. The two officers are under investigation by the Justice Department, Lyons said. The announcement comes one day after federal prosecutors dropped the criminal cases against two immigrants in connection with the Jan. 14 episode.</p>
<p>DHS leaders, including Secretary <b>KRISTI NOEM</b>, had previously defended the officers, saying they had fended off an “attempted murder” and that one officer had fired in self-defense. Agents initially said that two men assaulted them with a broom and a shovel before one of the agents fired at one of the men. But that account was quickly called into question, and prosecutors now say “newly discovered” evidence contradicts the officers’ story.</p>

<h2>POTUS PUZZLER ANSWER</h2>
<p>Former President <b>GEORGE W. BUSH</b> during Trump’s first inauguration in 2017 had a (one-of-many) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntYZK9ZMCaA">viral moment</a>, where he struggled to get his poncho on, as former Vice President <b>DICK CHENEY</b> sat behind him, smirking.</p>
