<strong>Maria Bustillos</strong></p>
<h2>Fine and Dandy</h2>
<p>I had fun being interviewed last year by Natty Adams for a book about contemporary dandyism (his <a href="https://www.rosecallahan.com/books"><u>third in a series</u></a> with photographer Rose Callahan); it was an opportunity to let loose and nerd out a bit about one of my special interests, which doesn’t get much airtime in these days of living on the knife edge of history.</p>
<p>But at one point Natty asked me a perfectly reasonable question that caught me a little off guard: was it strange for someone in a leftist political orbit, being into menswear at a time when classic tailoring had gotten kind of sucked up into the Retvrn movement and, consequently, the country’s fascist slide? I hadn’t really given it much thought, because I don’t necessarily consider the Richard Spencers of the world to have a genuine interest in the craft and the history of menswear—at least not in the same way I do, despite having made their bones on looking the part of “respectable” Nazis in their three-piece suits.</p>
<p>What I mean to say is that I can’t really imagine as joyless and repulsive a person as Spencer, or Stephen Miller—men who, despite their malevolence and power, seem kind of addled, one-dimensional, almost pathetic—really <em>caring</em> about, say, fabrics and drapes and canvassing and the rest of the techniques, the aesthetic history and the social meanings of menswear. If they wear tailored suits with pocket squares and silk ties, it does not seem to be out of an appreciation for the labor, the creativity, and attention to detail that have gone into making such things; they don’t aspire to the kind of elegance that’s rooted in knowledge and taste. Instead they want to convey that they are just like the Men Who Used to Run Things, before all this modernity came and knocked them off their rightful pedestal above other people. It is, in effect, a uniform, if a less controversial one than some of the other sharply-tailored uniforms they might choose to wear.</p>
<p>This is borne out by the fact that a lot of right-wingers are terrible at dressing themselves. Some subset of these fash-aesthetics types may have beheld a tape measure, but anyone who’s ever been near a MAGA rally or club meeting has been subjected to some of the shiniest red ties and illest-fitting navy suits conceivable, the oft-sweaty inhabitants of these polyester prisons hardly able to move freely. They don’t care about the thing itself, or for itself; they care about the concept, the projection of appearing to be part of an in-group of the powerful in a way that connects them to an imagined past where they’d top out every social hierarchy. And, of course, for the MAGA crowd, wearing a suit is a connection to their vessel Trump, who is rarely seen in public outside of a suit apparently designed primarily to envelop him, with a hideous tie, yards long—once compared to “a kitchen tablecloth” by broadcast legend Phil Donahue—that laughs in the face of taste.</p>
<figure><img alt="" src="https://flaminghydra.com/content/images/2026/02/img_2104_1__720.jpg"/><img alt="" src="https://flaminghydra.com/content/images/2026/02/img_9841_720.jpg"/><img alt="" src="https://flaminghydra.com/content/images/2026/02/img_3672_720.jpg"/><img alt="" src="https://flaminghydra.com/content/images/2026/02/20251217-img_3907_720.jpg"/><img alt="" src="https://flaminghydra.com/content/images/2026/02/img_6481_720.jpg"/><figcaption>All the lewks </figcaption></figure>
<p>Let me be clear here that this isn’t about class snobbery. My ensembles would not themselves pass muster with most menswear traditionalists, as I often include over-the-top elements, along with painted nails and earrings and eyeliner. I wear suits to go to the grocery store because <em>I like them</em>, a lot, and I think everyone should be free to choose what they like to wear (within reason; I think everyone would benefit from having at least one versatile suit in the closet).</p>
<p>What I find both amusing and irksome is that traditional menswear is an ostensible point of propriety for these wannabe authoritarians and they don’t even care about it at all. Even this vaunted totem of their status and superiority is completely hollow, like the rest of their putrid ideology. It’s a copy of a copy of what they think they’re supposed to be doing, dull and cheerless and divorced from the elements of human enjoyment that are really supposed to power our fashion, our expressions of ourselves.</p>
<p>Does any of this matter in the grand scheme of things? I suppose you could argue that if fascism is linked to aesthetics and politics is to some extent just messaging, perhaps it does. We all signal something with what we choose to wear. Still, at a moment when masked federal shock troops, themselves in a manner of costume—either in oddly pedestrian clothing or full combat gear—are <a href="https://thebaffler.com/latest/states-of-denial-de-la-hoz"><u>laying siege to cities</u></a> around the country, I am aware that how white nationalists choose to dress up is far down the list of active concerns.</p>
<p>Yet I’m sure as hell not going to let them have this. Suiting has a cultural and political heritage, and it doesn’t belong to them; the suits marchers wore in Selma as they stared down racists who wanted to see them as subhuman are part of that legacy, too. So are the zoot suits worn by Black, Latino, Asian, and other racial and ethnic minorities to differentiate and celebrate themselves in increasingly integrated urban enclaves in the mid-20th century, a style that put targets on their backs during the Zoot Suit Riots of 1943.</p>
<p>Plus, taking an interest in menswear is just fun, an enjoyable rabbit hole to go down, like so many niche pursuits: a fascinating discipline that makes living in a wretched world of fascists and rich, remorseless pedophiles and all the rest just a bit more bearable. I delight in my patterned ascots and interesting fabric blends (have you ever felt a silk-cotton flannel fabric? I have, and let me tell you, wow). So no, the Nazis don’t get the religion, they don’t get the media, they don’t get the streets, and they certainly don’t get the suits. They don’t really know how to wear them anyway.</p>

<p><strong>THE BILLIONAIRE</strong>’<strong>S PLAYBOY CLUB </strong>by Virginia Giuffre</p>
<p>★★★★★</p>
<p>An <a href="https://couriernewsroom.com/news/epstein-files-database/">early cache of the Epstein Files</a> was published by Courier/Good Information <a href="https://couriernewsroom.com/news/we-created-a-searchable-database-with-all-20000-files-from-epsteins-estate/">last November</a>, and they were the first ones I read. I scanned a few documents at random, but soon found myself deeply absorbed in a rough draft of <a href="https://journaliststudio.google.com/u/1/pinpoint/document-view?collection=092314e384a58618&amp;utm_source=collection_share_link&amp;pli=1&amp;p=1&amp;docid=5c8fdbf13e234a6b_092314e384a58618_0&amp;page=1&amp;dapvm=2">the late Virginia Giuffre’s memoir</a>, <em>Nobody’s Girl</em>. The book based on this document was ghostwritten by Amy Wallace and published by Knopf in October of last year, after the author’s death in April. I only recently thought to compare the draft to the published book, and was surprised by what I found.</p>
<p>The original draft of about 80,000 words tells the story of the author’s sexual abuse and trafficking at the hands of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell; I later learned that it had already been unsealed in <a href="https://embed.documentcloud.org/documents/6251258-Virginia-Roberts-Memoir/">August 2019, as an exhibit</a> in Giuffre’s 2015 lawsuit against Maxwell. Unlike the eventual book, the draft’s opening is vividly (if haphazardly and ungrammatically) written, crackling with raw electricity and feeling. You can’t help but love the author right away, right from the first lines: <em>Every single person in this shared world together has a unique story of his or her own to tell, this one is mine.</em></p>
<p>That line doesn’t appear in the book, though. Wallace’s style is relatively mannerly and sentimental, even simpering. Giuffre’s “foxy red mini dress” becomes Wallace’s “short red dress,” and so on. And weirdly, the book opens with a scene in which a “construction worker” in a white van rapes the author at gunpoint, shoving the barrel of a gun into her mouth. Then he goes off to take a phone call (?) and the author makes her escape. This scene isn’t in the manuscript, either. She seems never to have mentioned it elsewhere.</p>
<p>The sleuths of Reddit say that many real people’s names were changed in Giuffre’s manuscript, but the name of <a href="https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/ronald-r-eppinger-federal-bureau-of-investigation-78970/">Ron Eppinger</a>, her first pimp, is real: he was busted in 2001 and went to jail. Another discrepancy: the book claims that Giuffre was 15 when she went to live with Eppinger for six months, and her memoir says she was 13.</p>
<p>Here’s a passage from each version to compare [sic throughout].</p>
<h3>From <em>The Billionaire’s Playboy Club</em><br/>by Virginia Roberts</h3>
<p>Out of nowhere, it seemed, a black stretch limousine turned the corner and stopped in front of the curb where I had been hopelessly lost. The back door opened to reveal a heavy weight and balding, old man with a big cheesy smile. Neatly dressed in black trousers and a collared shirt, he was sitting next to a striking young, blonde girl, drop dead beautiful and dressed in a foxy red mini dress she looked like a model just stepping off a runway. […]</p>
<p>Looking back later in life I can now admit I was in a terrible state, but being such a headstrong teenager, I refused to give in. He asked my age and I told him I was sixteen at first. He coyly replied, " Are you sure? I think you could be telling me a fib? How old are you... really? I wont be mad" Being a terrible liar, I knew had been caught out and couldn' t deny it any further. I told him the truth and he chuckled then paused and answered in a very serious tone " As long as you never lie to me again I will take you in"</p>
<p>Right away I pondered to myself what did he mean ... take me in? He gave the driver the location of our destination and rolled the middle window back up to then tell me a story of how his daughter had passed away seven years ago from a horrific car accident in which four other teens were killed and he has never gotten over it. I reacted with sheer sympathy and gave him my pity, believing his man had a heart. His next proposal was eerie, he said," If you wanted, I can be your new Daddy. Someone to take care of you and you' ll be my new baby forever" he stroked my hair such as a caring parent would comfort a scared child. A part of me wanted to accept his words and believe he really could feel that way, and then I also considered how hard it was living on the streets. In the end I convinced myself this would be the lesser of two evils.</p>
<p>The car stopped at a plaza on the water, surrounded by little boutique shops, restaurants, and little stalls with items for sale like sunglasses and costume jewelry. I didn' t know what to say or do or how to act, it all happened so fast I just went along with everything he said, for now. We went to a take out restaurant and ate on the waterside, and afterwards he took me to G. A. P Kids co. to dress me in his idea of proper attire, tiny cutoff shorts revealing the cusp of my buttocks and some shirts that barely fit, even the sales assistant was shocked at what she thought was my Grandfathers choice in clothing. I couldn't even believe it myself only an hour ago I was begging for money living on the streets and now I was dining alfresco and shopping at name brand outlets. We then hit a couple of more specialty stores afterwards. He said he had to buy me a few more necessities to start with. Lacy G- strings and what looked to me like lingerie pieces I had only seen grown women wearing in magazine ad' s or movies was now a part of my wardrobe, in my mind it was a big step up from being a little girl any longer.</p>
<h3>From <em>Nobody’s Girl</em></h3>
<p>That’s how I became this tearstained girl sitting on a curb in an empty beach parking lot. It is dusk when I see the limousine slow to a stop in front of me. The tinted rear passenger window hums as it opens, revealing the pasty face of a stranger in his sixties. He is heavyset, balding. I watch his eyes as they roam over my swollen, bruised face and battered body. “Oh, you poor baby,” the old man says. His concern sounds genuine. Peering into the car, I see a pretty girl in a short red dress sitting next to him. She smiles at me. The old man wears black slacks and a collared shirt. The men in my family tend toward blue jeans or coveralls. I hope this stranger is different from them in other ways too.</p>
<p>“Come in here so we can take care of you,” the old man says, as the girl nods encouragement. I think of my attacker driving around in his white van, his gun in his lap, searching for the girl who got away. I stand up, wobbly. The limo door opens, and the old man slides over to make room for me.</p>
<p>The old man tells the limo driver where to go, then introduces himself. His name is Ron Eppinger, and he runs a modeling agency called Perfect 10, he says. He gestures toward Yana, the girl next to him, who is from the Czech Republic. Would I like to become a model like her? He asks me how old I am, and at first I say sixteen because it sounds better to me, less vulnerable. Eppinger shakes his head; he isn’t buying it. So I tell him the truth, that I’m fifteen, which seems to please him. “As long as you never lie to me again, I will take you in,” he says. “What does that mean?” I think, but don’t ask out loud. Then Eppinger’s fleshy face turns sad. He had a daughter once, he says. Susan Marie. She died when she was fifteen, when the driver of a truck she was riding in fell asleep and crashed into a utility pole in Pompano Beach. Eppinger has never gotten over it, he tells me, and for a moment, I feel sorry for him.</p>
<p>That’s when he reaches for me and strokes my hair. “If you want,” Eppinger says, “I can be your new daddy.”</p>
<p>How quickly he does that, twisting the father-daughter bond into something sickening. But I already know that trick, and I want to believe it doesn’t work on me anymore. I don’t trust parents—especially fathers. I don’t need a daddy, old or new. […]</p>
<p>The old man, the model, and I order takeout from an oceanfront stand. As we eat—I scarf mine down like an animal—we listen to the waves. Then Eppinger says he wants to take me shopping. We go to a nearby GapKids, and he steers me toward short shorts that don’t cover my backside and tops that are way too small. From the look on the saleswoman’s face, it’s easy to tell what she’s thinking: This isn’t what most grandfathers buy their granddaughters. Next, we go to a lingerie store where Eppinger seems to be a regular. He picks out G-strings and other lacy things that I’ve only seen grown women wear in the movies. He holds them up to my newly developed body, leering. Finally, he tells the chauffeur to take us home.</p>
<p>There is a lot in this document that is hard to read and in fact I haven’t been able to finish it. But I recommend the real thing, if you do choose to read the book. I also believe that a real accounting of the events of Virginia Giuffre’s life are worth seeking out, verifying and documenting. It’s not too much to say that she is one of the most significant figures in U.S. history. It’s because of her that Ghislaine Maxwell is in jail; because of her that Epstein and the whole lair of monsters connected to him was exposed.</p>
