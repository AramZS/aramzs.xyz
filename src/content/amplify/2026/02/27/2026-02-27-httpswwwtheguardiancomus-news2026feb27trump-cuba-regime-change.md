<h2 data-gu-name="standfirst">As tensions between two countries reach high amid capture of Venezuela’s Maduro, US president says Cuba is in ‘trouble’</h2>
<p><a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> has suggested the US could carry out a “friendly takeover” of <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/cuba">Cuba</a> as tensions between Washington and Havana reach a new high following the capture of Venezuela’s <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/nicolas-maduro">Nicolás Maduro</a>.</p>
<p>As he left the White House for a campaigning event in Texas on Friday, Trump said: “The Cuban government is talking with us. They’re in a big deal of trouble.”</p>
<p>Although he gave no further details, it has been widely reported that US officials had <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/feb/26/what-to-know-cuba-boat-attack">met with Raúl Guillermo Rodríguez Castro</a>, the grandson of 94 year-old Raúl Castro, on the sidelines of the Caribbean leaders summit, Caricom, as part of negotiations opening up the island.</p>
<p>Trump on Friday said: “They have no money, they have no anything right now. But they’re talking with us and maybe we’ll have a friendly takeover of Cuba.”</p>
<p>The president’s comments come as relations between the two countries have sunk to among their worst in an often bitter 67-year history. The US has cranked up pressure on Cuba’s struggling regime following their successful abduction of Venezuelan president and Cuba ally <a data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/nicolas-maduro">Nicolás Maduro</a> in January.</p>
<p>In advance of the attack on Caracas, US officials <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/jan/22/delcy-rodriguez-capture-maduro-venezuela">won a promise of cooperation</a> from Maduro’s deputy, Delcy Rodríguez, now Venezuela’s acting president, who has <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/jan/30/venezuela-approves-bill-to-open-oil-sector-to-foreign-investment-after-us-pressure">promised to open up the country’s sizeable oil reserves</a> to foreign companies.</p>
<p>Pressure from Washington also led to the departure of attorney general Tarek William Saab and prompted Venezuela cut off oil exports to Cuba. The US has imposed an oil blockade on the island, <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/ng-interactive/2026/feb/15/cuba-crisis-oil-shortage-venezuela-donald-trump-havana">strangling what was left</a> of the island’s already parlous economy.</p>
<p>Trump said: “I’ve been hearing about Cuba since I was a little boy, but they’re in big trouble.”</p>
<p>Alluding to the large Cuban exile community in the US, he suggested a takeover of the island could be “something good ... very positive” for them, saying: “You know, we have people living here that want to go back to Cuba, and they’re very happy with what’s going on.”</p>
<p>Trump’s acquisitive language will provoke worries among Cubans that history is repeating itself: US financial domination of the Cuban economy was one of the main drivers of <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/fidel-castro">Fidel Castro</a>’s 1959 revolution.</p>
<p>His claim marked a startling departure from previous public statements. Cuban president Miguel Díaz-Canel has previously said that, while his government is willing to talk, any discussions could not involve Cuba’s internal affairs, and had to come “from a position of equals, with respect for our sovereignty, our independence, and our self-determination”.</p>
<p>“I reckon Cuba’s Berlin Wall moment is around the corner,” said Manuel Barcía, a history professor at the University of Bath who has family on the island he left in 2001. “It sounds like [US secretary of state] Marco Rubio has orchestrated a very impressive take down.”</p>
<p>Trump has long counted on electoral support from Cuban exiles concentrated in Miami who have dreamed of overthrowing the island’s Communist government established by Castro.</p>
<p>Trump’s comments come just a few days after what appears to be a group of heavily armed exiles from Florida attempted to land a launch full of weapons on the island’s north coast, <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/feb/25/cuba-says-border-guards-killed-four-gunmen-on-us-registered-speedboat">causing a gunfight at sea</a> that left four dead and seven injured.</p>
