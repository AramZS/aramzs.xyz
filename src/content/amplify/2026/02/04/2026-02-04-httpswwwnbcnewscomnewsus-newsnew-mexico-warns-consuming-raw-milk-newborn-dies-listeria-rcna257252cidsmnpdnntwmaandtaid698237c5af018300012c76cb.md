title: New Mexico warns against consuming raw milk after newborn dies from listeria
---
<p>Health officials in New Mexico are warning against consuming raw dairy products after a newborn baby in the state died from a listeria infection that they say was likely contracted when the baby's mother drank raw milk during pregnancy.</p>

<p>The New Mexico Department of Health in a news release said that officials believe the mother consumed unpasteurized milk while pregnant, which could have led to the listeria infection.</p>
<p>Officials cannot pinpoint the exact source of the listeria that led to the baby's death, the release said, but it noted that "the tragic death underscores the serious risks raw dairy poses to pregnant women, young children, elderly New Mexicans and anyone with a weakened immune system."</p>
<p>Dr. Chad Smelser, deputy state epidemiologist for the New Mexican Department of Health, said in the release that pregnant women should always only consume pasteurized milk in order to "prevent illnesses and deaths in newborns." Pasteurization is a process in which raw milk is heated to kill germs.</p>
<p>Listeria is one of many disease-causing germs that can appear in milk that has not been pasteurized. The bacteria in unpasteurized milk can cause miscarriage, stillbirth, preterm birth or fatal infection in newborns, and can cause serious infections and death in those with compromised immune systems, according to the health department.</p>
<p>People who drink raw milk can be exposed to pathogens including bird flu, brucella, tuberculosis, salmonella, campylobacter, cryptosporidium and E. coli, the health department release said.</p>
<p>Federal health officials have <a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/buy-store-serve-safe-food/food-safety-and-raw-milk">long warned</a> against drinking raw milk because of the health risks, and sales of raw milk across state lines have been banned since 1987.</p>
<p>But raw milk has surged in popularity in recent years. Before joining the second Trump administration, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. had proclaimed<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/raw-milk-kennedy-rcna213568"> himself to be a fan of the unpasteurized dairy choice</a>.</p>
<p>Since becoming health secretary, however, Kennedy has largely steered clear of the issue, despite a <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/raw-milk-kennedy-rcna213568">push by raw milk advocates</a> to change federal policy on raw milk.</p>
<p>The Trump administration's <a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/health/trump-signs-law-returning-whole-milk-school-lunches/4042643/">new campaign</a> to promote drinking whole milk does not mention raw milk. But some raw milk advocates have <a href="https://factcheck.afp.com/doc.afp.com.92ZV6T3">still been encouraged</a> by the move and other developments from Washington.</p>
<p>In September, the administration's <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/kennedys-new-maha-report-outlines-steps-improve-kids-health-short-spec-rcna223893">"Make America Healthy Again" report</a> offered new health guidelines at Kennedy's helm, and it included plans to remove barriers for small-dairy farmers selling their own milk. At the time, Nestle described it as a “big win” for companies selling whole or raw milk products.</p>
