<p>The Washington Post told employees on Wednesday that it was beginning a widespread round of layoffs.</p>
<p>The cuts, announced in a video call with employees, are a sign that Jeff Bezos, who became one of the world’s richest people by selling things on the internet, has not yet figured out how to build and maintain a profitable publication on the internet. The paper expanded during the first several years of his ownership, but the company has sputtered more recently.</p>
<p>“The actions we are taking include a broad strategic reset with a significant staff reduction,” Matt Murray, The Post’s executive editor, said on the call.</p>
<p>Mr. Bezos hired Will Lewis as publisher in late 2023 to find a path to profitability for The Post, which had been suffering from declining audiences and sagging subscriptions. Mr. Lewis has experimented with several changes to transform the organization, notably embracing artificial intelligence to power comments, podcasts and news aggregation.</p>
<p>At the end of 2024, Mr. Bezos described the struggle in an interview at a conference hosted by The New York Times: “We saved The Washington Post once, and we’re going to save it a second time.”</p>
<p>A person with direct knowledge of The Post’s strategy said its leadership was taking steps to save the organization. With the layoffs, the person said, The Post is trying to better align its offerings with the preferences of readers.</p>
<p>In a staff meeting in 2024, Mr. Lewis <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/05/business/media/washington-post-buzbee-lewis.html">warned</a> that The Post was in trouble. “We are losing large amounts of money,” he said. “Your audience has halved in recent years. People are not reading your stuff.”</p>

<p>The Post is far from alone among publishers in its struggles to achieve profitability. For many outlets, print circulation has continued to nosedive, digital traffic has been hampered by generative A.I. and audiences have splintered to various social media platforms. Publishers have had to experiment with different revenue streams, such as events and premium memberships, to offset losses.</p>
