title: The Data Center Boom Is Concentrated in the U.S.

<h2 data-type="text">But China’s growth remains a mystery</h2>
<p>If a data center is moving in next door, you probably live in the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/united-states">United States</a>. More than half of all upcoming global data centers—as indicated by land purchased for <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/data-centers">data centers</a> not yet announced, those under construction, and those whose plans are public—will be developed in the United States.</p>

<p>And these figures are likely underselling the near-term data-center dominance of the United States. Power usage varies widely among data centers, depending on land availability and whether the facility will provide x<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/data-center-liquid-cooling">https://spectrum.ieee.org/data-center-liquid-cooling</a> or mixed-use services, says <a href="https://eea.epri.com/research-staff.html#W">Tom Wilson</a>, who studies energy systems at the <a href="https://www.epri.com/">Electric Power Research Institute</a>. Because of these factors, “data centers in the U.S. are much larger on average than data centers in other countries,” he says.</p>
<p>Wilson adds that the dataset you see here—which comes from the analysis firm <a href="https://www.datacentermap.com/">Data Center Map</a>—may undercount new Chinese data centers because they are often not announced publicly. Chinese data-center plans are “just not in the repository of information used to collect data on other parts of the world,” he says. If information about <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/china">China</a> were up-to-date, he would still expect to see “the U.S. ahead, China somewhat behind, and then the rest of the world trailing.”</p>

<p>One thing that worries Wilson is whether the U.S. <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/power-grid">power grid</a> can meet the rising energy demands of these data centers. “We’ve had <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-energy">flat demand for basically two decades</a>, and now we want to grow. It’s a big system to grow,” he notes.</p>

<p>He thinks the best solution is asking data centers to be more flexible in their power use, maybe by scheduling complex computation for off-peak times or maintaining on-site <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/batteries">batteries</a>, removing part of the burden from the power grid. Whether such measures will be enough to keep up with demand remains an open question.</p>
