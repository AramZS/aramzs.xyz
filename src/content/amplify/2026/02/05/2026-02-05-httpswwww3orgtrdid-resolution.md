<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Decentralized identifier (DID) resolution is the process of obtaining a DID document and accompanying metadata for a specific DID. The process takes a DID and a set of resolution options as its input and returns a DID document and associated metadata about the resolved document and the resolution request. A resolved DID document is a set of information which enables cryptographically verifiable interactions with the DID subject, including mechanisms such as cryptographic public keys. This specification covers the algorithms and guidelines to be used for DID resolution and relies on the core DID specification, <a data-matched-text="[[[DID]]]" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) v1.0</a>, which describes the underlying DID architecture in full detail.</p>

<p><a data-link-type="dfn" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-did-resolution">DID resolution</a> is the process of obtaining a <a data-link-type="dfn" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-did-documents">DID document</a> for a given <a data-link-type="dfn" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-decentralized-identifiers">DID</a>. This is one of four required operations that can be performed on any DID ("Read"; the other ones being "Create", "Update", and "Deactivate"). The details of these operations differ depending on the <a data-link-type="dfn" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-did-methods">DID method</a>. Building on top of <a data-link-type="dfn" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-did-resolution">DID resolution</a>, <a data-link-type="dfn" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-did-url-dereferencing">DID URL dereferencing</a> is the process of retrieving a representation of a resource for a given <a data-link-type="dfn" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-did-urls">DID URL</a>. Software and/or hardware that is able to execute these processes is called a <a data-link-type="dfn" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-did-resolvers">DID resolver</a>.</p>
<p>This specification defines common requirements, algorithms including their inputs and results, architectural options, and various considerations for the <a data-link-type="dfn" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-did-resolution">DID resolution</a> and <a data-link-type="dfn" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-did-url-dereferencing">DID URL dereferencing</a> processes.</p>
<p>Note that while this specification defines some base-level functionality for DID resolution, the actual steps required to communicate with a DID's <a data-link-type="dfn" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-verifiable-data-registry">verifiable data registry</a> are defined by the applicable <a data-link-type="dfn" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-did-methods">DID method</a> specification.</p>
<p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>
<p>By invoking a <a data-link-type="dfn" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-did-resolvers">DID resolver</a> using the standard <code>resolve(did, resolutionOptions)</code> interface (as defined in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-resolution/#resolving">DID Resolution section</a>), one can obtain a <a data-link-type="dfn" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-did-documents">DID document</a> and accompanying metadata (e.g., <code>contentType</code>, proof, versioning), which an application can use to validate a user's cryptographic keys, service endpoints, or status.</p>
<p>For example, to retrieve the state of the DID <code>did:example:123</code> at a time in the past, a client application could resolve the DID with the <code>versionTime</code> resolution option, as in the following:<br/>
<code>resolve("did:example:123", {"versionTime":"2021-05-10T17:00:00Z"})</code> Or a client could dereference a DID URL like <code>did:example:123?service=files&amp;relativeRef=/resume.pdf</code> (see <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-resolution/#example-dereferencing-to-service-endpoint-url">here for detailed example</a>) to fetch a user's resume stored via a service declared in the DID document.</p>
<p>Further, the specification's <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-resolution/#dereferencing-algorithm">DID URL dereferencing algorithm</a> shows how a client can follow a fragment (e.g., <code>#key-1</code>) to extract a particular verification method from the <a data-link-type="dfn" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-did-documents">DID document</a> (see <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-resolution/#example-dereferencing-to-verification-method">here for detailed example</a>). In practice, implementers validate their resolver against the <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/did-resolution-mocha-test-suite">DID Resolution Test Suite</a> which exercises normative MUSTs and error conditions (such as invalid DIDs, deactivated DIDs, unsupported methods, relative URL expansion, etc.) to ensure that client applications can reliably depend on correct resolution behavior across different DID methods.</p>
<p>As well as sections marked as non-normative, all authoring guidelines, diagrams, examples, and notes in this specification are non-normative. Everything else in this specification is normative.</p>
<p>The key words <em>MAY</em>, <em>MUST</em>, <em>MUST NOT</em>, <em>OPTIONAL</em>, <em>RECOMMENDED</em>, <em>REQUIRED</em>, and <em>SHOULD</em> in this document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/bcp14">BCP 14</a> [<a data-link-type="biblio" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-resolution/#bib-rfc2119">RFC2119</a>] [<a data-link-type="biblio" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-resolution/#bib-rfc8174">RFC8174</a>] when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.</p>
<p>A conforming DID resolver is any algorithm realized as software and/or hardware that complies with the relevant normative statements in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-resolution/#resolving">4. DID Resolution</a>.</p>
<p>A conforming network-based DID resolver is a <a data-link-type="dfn|abstract-op" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-resolution/#dfn-conforming-did-resolver">conforming DID resolver</a> that additionally complies with the normative statements in <a data-matched-text="[[[#bindings-https]]]" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-resolution/#bindings-https">10.1 HTTP(S) Binding</a>.</p>
<p>A conforming DID URL dereferencer is any algorithm realized as software and/or hardware that complies with the relevant normative statements in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-resolution/#dereferencing">5. DID URL Dereferencing</a>.</p>

<p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>
<p>This specification has three primary audiences: implementers of conformant DID methods; implementers of conformant DID resolvers; and implementers of systems and services that wish to resolve DIDs using DID resolvers. The intended audience includes, but is not limited to, software architects, data modelers, application developers, service developers, testers, operators, and user experience (UX) specialists. Other people involved in a broad range of standards efforts related to decentralized identity, verifiable credentials, and secure storage might also be interested in reading this specification.</p>
<p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>
<p>The DID resolution specification is intended to support a broad range of use cases by defining a standardized interface to resolve DIDs and dereference DID URLs independent of the DID method of any particular DID. These usecases include:</p>
<ul> <li> A decentralized address book: By using DIDs as identifiers for people and organizations within an address book, the controllers of those DIDs can independently update the contents of their DID documents. Through DID resolution, these DIDs can be resolved to obtain the current state of the DID document for any given contact, enabling persistent stable identifiers with updatable services and verification material necessary for continued verifiable interactions. </li> <li> Verifying a Verifiable Credential: Verifiable Credentials are signed by an issuer and given to a holder. The holder can then create a Verifiable Presentation that is presented to a verifier. By using DIDs to identify issuers and holders within a credential, an issuer enables a verifier to use DID resolution to resolve the DID documents of the identified issuers and holders to obtain the verification material necessary to verify the signatures on the Verifiable Presentation. </li> <li> Auditability: DID resolution can be used to obtain the historical state of a DID document either at a specific point in time or for a specific version. This can be used to audit the historical verifiable actions of a DID controller; for example, the issuance of a verifiable receipt or the signing of a contract. </li> <li> DID URL based resource retrieval: A DID controller can add service endpoints to their DID document that point to resources they control; for example, a profile picture. If DID URLs are used to reference these resources, web applications can use DID resolution and DID URL dereferencing to retrieve the current version of the resource(s). The DID URL can be used as a persistent, dereferenceable identifier for these resources, while the DID controller can independently change the resource over time. </li> </ul>
