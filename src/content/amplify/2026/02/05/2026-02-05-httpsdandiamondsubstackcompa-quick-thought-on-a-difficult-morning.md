title: A quick thought on a difficult morning.

<p>We have a small scoop at The Washington Post this morning — President Trump is <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2026/02/04/trump-christopher-columbus-white-house/">planning to install a Christopher Columbus statue</a> outside the White House, eying a spot north of the Ellipse.</p>
<p>As a reporter, it’s interesting to me because Trump is clearly fixated on changing the White House grounds, a <a href="https://dandiamond.substack.com/p/our-week-of-breaking-news-about-the">storyline we’ve focused on</a>. He’s also continuing his push to celebrate Columbus. (“The Italian people are very happy about it. Remember when you go to the voting booths, I reinstated Columbus Day,” Trump said last month.)</p>
<p>But I wanted to tell you about the journalistic process, too.</p>
<p>This story is the latest collaboration between me (a White House reporter) and <a href="https://x.com/oliviacgeorge">Olivia George</a> (one of our fabulous local reporters).</p>
<p>This kind of collaboration has long been normal in The Post’s newsroom. It enriches our news product. So many of my biggest stories have been because of team-ups like these.</p>
<p>That model is now under threat. We’re expecting significant layoffs — they may have happened by the time you read this.</p>
<p>I don’t know what will happen. I do know that too many great reporters, editors and other staffers are about to lose their jobs. And I know that news organizations all over the country are under their own serious pressure.</p>
<p>So whatever you think of our article, or The Post itself, I hope you’ll support your local newspaper, as reporters chase scoops large and small. I hope you’ll cheer on writers whose work is threatened by shifts to video, reliance on AI and other changes reshaping how we get our news.</p>
<p>As I write this, there are journalists out there working to break big stories — far bigger than a White House statue. They’re trying to shed light on dark corners, bring attention to problems, or just inform us in captivating ways.</p>
<p>I want to read *<strong>those</strong>* articles, not ones about layoffs that continue to shape and shrink this industry.</p>
