<h2>Description</h2>
<p><em>Episodes: - S1E1 &ldquo;I/O&rdquo;, S1E2 &ldquo;FUD&rdquo;, S1E3 &ldquo;High Plains Hardware&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The first three episodes introduce the characters and the relationships they have with computers. In 1983, the personal computer is not a totally new concept. IBM is the dominant force with a lot of smaller companies seeking to be the cheaper alternative model. This allows the series to start off under the guise of the &ldquo;two men in a garage&rdquo; cliche of U.S. technology history while actually situating it in a common small and boring tech company, like many others across the country.</p>
