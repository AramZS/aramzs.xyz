<p>‘Perseverance’ is a word that comes to mind when I think about the band LAPêCHE. The band has worked hard to build a sound and a following of their own while trying to stand out amongst the noise of the New York City music scene. Since the band’s inception in 2016, vocalist Krista Holly Diem and bassist Dave Diem got married, got sober, and moved a third of a way across the country to the mountains of Salt Lake City, far away from the New York City groove. Yet, they continue to persevere and make this music thing work, one song at a time.</p>
<p>While they are a product of the Brooklyn DIY scene and still consider themselves a Brooklyn band (as guitarist Drew DeMaio and drummer Colin Brooks still live in the area), they needed to go west to find themselves and make the best album of their career so far.</p>
<p>Their new record, <em>Autotelic </em>(out today via Tiny Engines) is about finding peace and resolution within yourself despite stresses brought on by the outside world and everyday life. Recorded with producer Alex Newport (At the Drive In, The Mars Volta, Fudge Tunnel) in Joshua Tree, CA, it’s about the act of creating music for the love of it and nothing else. For many of us, music is the only thing that makes sense anymore.</p>
<p>I’ve been a fan of this band for a while now, but they’ve never sounded this sharp and this focused. Songs like “Double Knotted,” “I Heart NY,” and “Parallel Park” are stadium-sized rockers, both confident and cutting in their delivery. “Happy 4 U” - the album’s centerpiece and first official single - is a deceptively vulnerable anthem about infertility and grief, it’s joyful sound contrasted with the sadness underneath the hood.</p>
<p>I think what I love most about this record is how much it sounds like the alternative rock I adored in college in the late 2000s, early 2010s - shit like Metric or Paramore or Tegan and Sara. You used to hear that stuff all the time on alternative radio stations like K-ROCK in New York and Radio 1045 in Philly, before <a href="https://defector.com/the-tragedy-of-stomp-clap-hey">“Stomp, Clap, Hey”</a> took over. I miss this shit, and I’m glad LAPêCHE is bringing it back in a new way that feels fresh.</p>
<p>After messaging back and forth on Instagram for a few weeks, mostly about the band Geese (spoiler alert: they don’t get it either), I was finally able to catch Dave and Krista last week over Zoom as I escaped a freak snow storm in North Carolina. We talked about <em>Autotelic, </em>recording with Alex Newport, the struggles of wanting to become a parent, being a middle-aged band, and the importance of persevering to find joy in making music despite living under an administration hellbent on destroying empathy.</p>

<p><em>[slightly edited for length and clarity]</em></p>
<p><strong>You guys doing all right?</strong></p>
<p>Krista: Yeah, you know what's weird is we're in Salt Lake City and we have no snow. Everyone's getting snow except for us.</p>
<p><strong>Do you live there now?</strong></p>
<p>Krista: We do. Half of us live here and half of us live in Brooklyn. Dave and I go back and forth a lot. But, yeah, we have the house here now.</p>
<p><strong>So that explains the Joshua Tree recording session I guess, right?</strong></p>
<p>Krista: You would think, but no.</p>
<p><strong>Oh well I was gonna ask later but let’s get right into it then: what made you go to Joshua Tree to make the new record?</strong></p>
<p>Krista: Alex Newport started following us on Instagram, and we were like, who's this guy? We looked him up and were like, oh, he worked on this record and he produced this record and he mixed this record. I don't even know who reached out first, but we we were like, maybe we should record with him.</p>
<p>We started working with him remotely, because we were still in Brooklyn. We set a date and raised money to work with him because he's a little more pricey than who we'd worked with before. And, yeah, so that's how that happened. We worked with him for a little over a year. He told us to write as many songs as you possibly can, which is like not how I operate. It was very uncomfortable for me. But we wrote like 20 songs and sent him all of them. And then he had the final say of the top 10 songs we're going to choose.</p>
<p><strong>Did he say how you caught his attention in the first place?</strong></p>
<p>Dave: So I think I was the first one to reach out. When I saw that he started following us and we usually try to say hi to whoever follows us. I noticed the name, and I was like, is that that Newport? And our guitar player Drew was a huge fan of Fudge Tunnel, Alex's band that had some acclaim back in the 90s. Drew was in this band called Floor and played with one of Alex's other bands. So there were some connection there. We were fans of things that he had worked on. We just kind of started messaging back and forth and there was like an immediate connection with Alex. We all just kind of hit it off. During COVID, we learned to write remotely, you know? Alex was out in Joshua Tree, we were in New York City and he just was like, well, if we work together, here's how I work. He said “I'm going to be basically part of the band, I'm gonna gonna have input, and I'm going to tell you what I think. We're going to write as many as songs as possible, and we're gonna trim it down.” So there were songs that we did not end up going in and recording. We narrowed it down to 10. He would be like “nope, that I don't connect with that song” So that was kind of weird for us, you know.</p>
<p>Krista: I had to fight him on “Happy 4 U”. I was like this <em>has</em> to be on the record.</p>
<p><strong>He didn’t want that on the record? It feels like the centerpiece.</strong></p>
<p>Krista: We thought so too.</p>
<p><strong>Is it hard to when a producer like Alex critiques your songs like that after you’ve written 20?</strong></p>
<p>Krista: I just am not.. I can't, like, spit stuff out. I'm not a jammer. I can’t be like let's get together and jam. I don't know how. So whenever something comes out of me, it's like, well, that's it. This has got to be it. So yeah, it was hard, especially since some of the songs that we loved he was just like, no. But then when we got in the studio, it was amazing.</p>
<p><strong>What was it like recording in Joshua Tree?</strong></p>
<p>Dave: We lived in Joshua Tree for a month. It felt like an adult summer camp or something like that. It was magical. The songs were mostly shaped when we went in there, but we wrote more in the studio, and the songs definitely changed and developed while we were in there. One of the things that Alex did with our writing that improved it was Drew and I really tried to simplify the way that we played. A lot of times in the past, the guitars and vocals were competing. We got much better at leaving space between the notes and really writing around the vocals. Whereas before, sometimes they would be written in isolation or the entire song would be written musically first and Krista would put the vocals on top of it. Alex wanted the vocals to be the centerpiece and we'd write around them. We had to get used to stepping back, you know, and that is something that was new and very cool. We spent way more time on vocals than ever before.</p>
<p>Dave: And he also was like, the guys can't sing anymore [laughs]. Krista was okay with that. We're all punk rock yelpers, you know, and Krista's the only singer of the band. So Krista came up with these incredible ideas for her vocal melodies.</p>
<p>Krista: It was really nice. The recording we've done before was like, hey, we'd have three days and we’ve got to get all of it in there and it was just the latest 10 songs that we wrote and they all make it on the record. I felt like vocals were like the least important thing when we were recording before. And so it was just awesome that I had all this time to really work on it as we were recording. And there were a lot of times where I would like sing the same line over and over and Alex would say “okay, let’s try it again.” I would get frustrated and annoyed, like I don't know what he wants. Then I would sing the line all pissed off and he’d be like, “that was it!” Now when I listen, I'm like, okay, yeah, I can totally like hear the emotion behind it. And I don't know if that's what he was trying to get out of me, being pissed off in the moment, but it was awesome to work on it. I also had the time to really play around with my harmony ideas, because I've never been able to do that in the past either. I didn't feel like I had to hurry up because we were running out of daylight.</p>
<p>Dave: A beautiful thing about working with Alex was putting our trust in him. We got along as a band better than we’ve ever had before. Alex was the tiebreaker, you know? Because we felt like he knew us enough. He knew what we were trying to do. We were super vulnerable with him and with the lyrics and everything. So we were just like, okay, if Alex thinks it, then that's what we're going to go with. So that was cool. We’re still close with him.</p>
<p><strong>You guys have been a doing this for, what, 10 years now? What have you learned about your band over the past 10 years?</strong></p>
<p>Dave: Ooh, that's a tough question. One thing that every time we've gone to record, it's like, well, this is probably the last time we get to record, you know, like, we're grown ups and we don't make money off of this and we really can't afford to keep doing this. Then we record another album and then we're like okay, I guess this is probably the last time we're going to be able to do this. And so I think to me, it just says that music is a part of life. It doesn't really matter what the capacity is or whatever. None of us are ready to abandoned it. Creating music is still something that we really enjoy.</p>
<p><strong>Do you guys feel like this is like a new chapter now? Do you feel refreshed as a band?</strong></p>
<p>Krista: [turns to Dave] do you feel refreshed? [laughs]</p>
<p>Dave: It's hard to feel refreshed these days [laughs] but yeah. This band existed through mostly the entire Trump administration. We feel like music is a way for us to maybe put some good into the world. Like the IDLES record <em>Joy Is An Act Of Resistance. </em>I'm a public school teacher or I was for 15 years and for me, I felt like my personal suffering was a measure of how much I cared, you know what I mean? And I I guess for us, music is a way for us to find some presence and happiness and to contribute in spite of other things, if that makes sense.</p>
<p>And I think self-care is not an indulgence. Like, we take care of ourselves in one another so that we can show up for others and for us kind of creating music is our little way to be able to to do that, you know? And if a few people hear our music, hopefully it's helpful and there's some connection. And that's what we need right now. We don't want the Trump regime to steal those moments of joy. They want us to be in fear. They want us to be angry and isolated and feel like music can’t be part of the solution.</p>
<p><strong>Does that sort of combo of anger and hopefulness make it into the music, into the lyrics on this album?</strong></p>
<p>Krista: Yeah, totally. I think it can be taken in a lot of ways, going through really hard things but having perseverance. People are feeling hopeless and scared and I also feel that, but I also want to try to bring a little bit of hope, you know? By saying these things out loud, somebody might be like oh, yeah, I'm not by myself. And that goes to what you were saying, Dave, about like bringing good into the world and not being bogged down. When people can connect with what you’re saying, it's not a small thing.</p>
<div class="rw-embed-wrapper"><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7AMElsum7a4" type="video/mp4"/></div>
<p><strong>Speaking of songs that might connect with some people, can you tell me a little bit about “Happy 4 U”?</strong></p>
<p>Krista: Yeah. “Happy 4 U” is about the struggling to be happy for people, families or women in general who have children or are pregnant or have had an easy time becoming a mother. That just hasn't been the case for me. When I sing that song, I start crying, because it's… it's really personal. And I wanted the song to feel really happy and very danceable, in a way like I'm just trying to be happy for people that get to experience that. Actually, I might cry now.</p>
<p><strong>We don't have to talk about it if it's too hard.</strong></p>
<p>Krista: I don't mind. I cry all the time [laughs]. Yeah, that struggle of wanting something like becoming a mother and not being able to get it. It seems like it comes really easily to other people. Being able to have children is such a gift. So it just kind of pisses me off that infertility is not talked about that much. Infertility is a struggle for a lot of women, especially women, like, in their older feet who decide to have children a little bit later in life. There's a lot of loss that comes with that and a lot of disappointment and so yeah, that's kind of what the song is about.</p>
<p>Dave: There's the juxtaposition of like this happy song, and then I think Krista, that you are happy for people.</p>
<p>Krista: Yeah, I am.</p>
<p>Dave: She's a nanny to a beautiful kid, and she's amazing. But we lost two wanted pregnancies. We went through IVF a lot. And we did decide to try to have kids later in life and things like that, but it's been been very, very hard.</p>
<p><strong>I also wanted to ask you about “I Heart NY.” Can you tell me a little bit about that song? I mean, I know you guys don't live there anymore, so what is your connection to New York City at this point?</strong></p>
<p>Dave: Well, I mean, we are there a lot. Half of us are still there. And we were just there in November. So we're there a couple of times a year. I feel I feel very proud of myself and very lucky that I've got to live there for so long. It's just not an easy place to live. I just have such a love and hate relationship with it and that's kind of what the song is about. It's about like I wish I didn't love you so much, because I really hate you.</p>
<p><strong>Do you still feel like a New York band?</strong></p>
<p>Krista: Oh, totally. I mean, that's where we've been until like the last couple years. We still haven't even played any shows on the West Coast, so the only shows we play are like Brooklyn, New Jersey, Philly, DC.</p>
<p><strong>Are you planning to do a tour for this one?</strong></p>
<p>Krista: We're hoping to, yeah, we're working on it. Hopefully, like, late spring, early summer, just a couple of “weekend warrior” kind of tours where we're like, okay, work all week and then Friday we're going to head out and do two or three shows or whatever. I mean, that's kind of how it needs to be these days, right?</p>
<p><strong>What's it like being a band in 2026, promoting a new record?</strong></p>
<p>Krista: It’s hard. There's just so much music being like churned out, even AI music. So it's a little disheartening to be to be putting out a record and you’re wondering if anyone going to hear it. Do we even have like a sliver of a chance to be successful in the way that this music, this band can sustain itself?</p>
<p>Dave: Yeah. It's funny, the name of the record is <em>Autotelic</em>, and that's doing something for the sake of doing it. It is the means to the end. We're creating this just for the act of creating it, but we also want as many people to hear it because we hope that people connect with it and really enjoy it. But also work towards the 000.1% chance that we are able to get some traction and be able to sustain it without it fully coming out of our pockets or whatever, you know what I mean? So it's like this this funny balance of like trying to promote ourselves, and that's uncomfortable for us. We've been really lucky to have this record be on Tiny Engines, who has a much wider distribution than we've had before. Also we're middle-aged band…</p>
<p>Krista: don't tell anyone [laughs]</p>
<p>Dave: When I was a teenager, you know, middle aged folks putting out music was pathetic [laughs]. We’re lucky that with the internet, kids are less ageist these days, you know? We feel good about aging into our music, and we think this record's the best thing that we've done.</p>
<p><strong>It's funny you say that because I was just thinking the other day how as a kid, I used to worry like, oh, I got to start a band in my 20s, that’s the age when like The Beatles and all these bands make their best music or whatever. Now I’m 37 and it's like, oh man, did I miss my time? But there are plenty of great bands making vital music later in life. Just look at Bob Mould or Guided By Voices. It doesn't matter anymore.</strong></p>
<p>Krista: It doesn't, but I do think the people that show up to shows and are, like, willing to go out to a show and to listen to live music, I think it's a younger crowd. So it’s like, we've got to tap into that. How do we get the kids to listen and become interested in coming out to our show? [laughs] We got to make some connections with some of the cool kids that are doing music.</p>
<p><strong>So how do you do that?</strong></p>
<p>Krista: I think by participating and trying to stay stay knowledgeable about what's going on. Trying to engage. And, yeah, and supporting, even though, like, I'm resentful, supporting younger bands, you know? Yeah. And just like, you don't even know. But.</p>
<p><strong>So, like, like Geese, for example. '</strong></p>
<p>Krista: [laughs] Oh, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Going back to </strong><em><strong>Autotelic,</strong></em><strong> does this feel like the record you’ve been building up to for 10 years?</strong></p>
<p>Krista: Oh, my gosh, yes, absolutely. This is the best thing we’ve ever done, and not just because it’s the last thing that we did. It really feels like it’s on a different level.</p>
<p>Dave: I will say, you asking that question just reminded me: being a band in 2026, the music industry has changed so much and there’s so much preamble and once it comes out, it’s like you drive a car off off the lot, it loses its value. You release a single, and you’re like sweet you’re on this playlist, and then you’re off the playlist. It’s all preamble. It was excruciating choosing the singles for this album. We feel like every song could be a single. We know that people listen to playlists and singles now, and those are the songs that people are going to hear. They may not hear the rest of the album. We think in terms of, like, we have a side A and a side B, we have a song one and a song five, a song six, and a song 10, and it’s like, what is it going to sound like if you listen to side one or side two in isolation? We are just really hoping that folks listen to the full album. That’s like my plea to anybody who has the record. It’s a story from start to finish. The songs are in order for a reason. We also hope every song stands on its own. We think it does. We think all the songs could have been singles, even if some of them are weird. But it’s meant to be listened to as an album. That’s my plea.</p>
