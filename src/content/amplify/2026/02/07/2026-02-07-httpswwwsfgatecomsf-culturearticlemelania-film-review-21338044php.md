<p>I’m in Philadelphia. I’ve just <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/cannabis/article/weed-cafe-san-francisco-19474546.php">smoked a joint</a> in a back alley and then checked into my hotel. My room is on the 10th floor: a corner room with a beautiful view of downtown Philly in front of my bed and to the right of it. I plop down on the hotel bed and close my eyes, taking in the late afternoon sun blasting through the windows. I feel the sun on my skin. On my face. The THC does its work and now I no longer feel as if I’m in Pennsylvania at all. I feel as if I’m lying in a great glass case, on display for the angels to see. I feel transported. Safe. Glorious.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://cdn-channels-pixel.ex.co/events/0012000001fxZm9AAE?integrationType=DEFAULT&amp;template=design%2Farticle%2Fplatypus_two_column.tpl"/></p>
<p>And for just a lone, unpleasant second, I think to myself, “Hey man, this must be how Melania Trump feels all the time.”</p>
<p>This is because I’d just seen “Melania” the day before this. For work, mind you. I’d never actually go see this film of my own accord, although a handful of our most gullible Americans did just that over the weekend. The first lady’s self-produced “documentary” made <a href="https://variety.com/2026/film/box-office/melania-documentary-box-office-strong-opening-weekend-send-help-1236645970/">$7 million</a> at the box office over that period, defeating initial expectations that it would gross $0 million. Like <a href="https://nypost.com/2026/02/05/media/jimmy-kimmel-blasts-melania-trumps-movie-by-floating-rigged-conspiracy-theory/">Jimmy Kimmel</a>, I’m not convinced that everyone who bought a ticket to “Melania” actually bothered to <em>attend</em> “Melania.” But honestly, you and I have bigger lies to debunk right now. The only important thing here is that “Melania” exists, even if barely so. It’s the least essential movie I’ve ever seen. That it exists at all is a damning indictment of all the backroom deals that went into its production and of all the people involved in those deals, the first lady included.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Article continues below this ad</p>
<p>A quick rundown of said deals: <a href="https://puck.news/newsletter_content/what-im-hearing-melanias-35m-rollout-podcast-battle-brewing-oscar-flexes/">Amazon/MGM</a>, owned by Trump donor Jeff Bezos, purchased “Melania” for $40 million and then spent an extra $35 million to promote it, somewhat negating that initial $7 million box office haul. The film was directed by Hollywood exile Brett Ratner, who was <a href="https://variety.com/2017/biz/news/brett-ratner-natasha-henstridge-accused-sexual-harassment-1202604256/">credibly accused of sexual assault</a> by multiple women back in 2017, and <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/melania-trump-documentary-amazon-behind-the-scenes-1235505208/">reportedly acted like a pig</a> while on the set of this film as well. Ratner was also just hired to direct “Rush Hour 4” because President Trump wants one, and because we all remember the “Rush Hour” films exclusively for Ratner’s keen direction. Hence, this Melania documentary was never intended to make a profit. It was only made so that it could be made.</p>
<p>YouTube</p>
<p>And it shows. “Melania” isn’t really a movie, and it certainly doesn’t qualify as a documentary. It has no journalistic value and even less entertainment value. It reveals nothing about its subject, and makes no effort to. To watch “Melania” is to watch Mrs. Trump glide through a meticulously curated existence, with designers and chefs and aides welcoming the first lady with smiles every time she walks into a room. Unless you count the stagehands who wave to Mrs. Trump as she walks through an arena concourse, you will not see her interact with actual Americans. And instead of seeing the first lady volunteer in times of crisis (during the LA wildfires, for instance), you’ll see her solemnly watch those events unfold on TV. You’ll get to watch her attend memorial services for fallen servicemembers, and you’ll hear her voiceover — read with about as much conviction as a fifth grader delivering an oral book report — tell you that their deaths make her sad. None of it will move you.</p>

<p>You WILL get to see intense close-ups of Melania’s maxed-out stiletto heels as she steps out of an SUV, though. So that’s neat. You’ll get multiple shots of Melania as she stares out of car windows. You’ll hear great, expensive-to-license songs like “Gimme Shelter” used violently out of context. And you’ll get revealing exchanges between Ratner and Melania like this one:</p>

<p>Ratner: “What’s your favorite Michael Jackson song?”</p>
<p>Trump: “‘Billie Jean.’”</p>
<p>Ratner: “Oh, wow.”</p>
<p>Quite the deep cut she chose. And of course, get to see Melania meet and greet with other members of this cloistered ruling class: her husband, her 9-foot-tall son Barron, her loser stepkids, vice president JD Vance, <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/tech/article/elon-musk-sparks-reddit-revolt-20049806.php">Tesla Nazi Elon Musk</a>, Apple CEO Tim Cook and, hold your surprise, Jeff Bezos. All of these members of the Trump circle are busy living the high life, and none of them have time for the problems of the little people, even if they happen to be the root cause <em>of</em> those problems. It’s like watching “ <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/streaming/article/succession-series-finale-recap-18124356.php">Succession</a>” if “Succession” had no plot.</p>

<p>President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump in the documentary “Melania.”</p>
<p>Regine Mahaux</p>
<p>About that nonexistent plot: Ratner filmed this movie over the course of 20 days leading up to Donald Trump’s second inauguration early last year. That’s right: It’s a hype video from one of the least hyped events in American history.</p>
<p>“Everyone wants to know,” Melania tells the audience at the beginning of the movie, “so here it is.” No, ma’am. No one wanted to know about this. YOU GUYS WERE ALREADY INAUGURATED. And I didn’t watch <em>that</em> ceremony either, because I don’t like having to vomit. So what am I dying to know about a f—king rerun of this thing? How you picked your dress? The fact that you were the first person to get a look at the invites for the ball? That every dinner guest got an amuse-bouche featuring a gold leaf-coated egg topped with a generous dollop of caviar? That you and your husband interact with each other like he’s your grandpa? That you sound like Derek Zoolander if Derek Zoolander was a real person? No. No, I don’t want any of that garbage. I would have preferred you make something USEFUL out of the suffering that you and your friends have caused, instead of spending $75 million on the celluloid equivalent of a 108-minute ad for a perfume sold at Macy’s.</p>
<p>It’s incredible to watch this film knowing how openly tone-deaf, and how openly <em>dated</em>, it is throughout its entire running time. Melania Trump is an uninteresting person, and strategically so. Here’s a woman from Eastern Europe who knows she’s got it better now than she did back when she was a nobody. If she has to make herself into a public blank to keep living that high life, it’s well worth it. Hence, you rarely see her facial expression change through this film, and you hear her say nothing of import. That glaring lack of human expression makes it impossible for anyone under 85 in the audience to feel empathy with Melania Trump, which therefore makes it impossible to ignore all of the things that her movie doesn’t say and would never dare to show.</p>

<p>Because here’s an incomplete list of everything that’s happened since Trump’s husband was re-inaugurated. He appointed RFK Jr. to head up Health and Human Services, quickly reintroducing measles back into the general population. He sent Immigration and Customs Enforcement to <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/drew-magary-jd-vance-21293327.php">shoot and kill Minnesotans</a>. He razed <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/remember-the-attack-on-the-white-house-21117718.php">an entire section of the White House</a>, including the Rose Garden that Melania claims, in her doc, that she helped restore during her husband’s first term. Everything at the grocery store costs $30 now. Musk started up <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/sf-culture/article/elon-musk-fake-wikipedia-grokipedia-21131512.php">a racist version of Wikipedia</a>, and Bezos just <a href="https://defector.com/the-washington-post-lays-off-a-third-of-its-workforce-is-dead">killed his Washington Post</a> in broad daylight. The first lady’s own cryptocurrency <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/carlquintanilla.bsky.social/post/3me5ll3juik2a">went into the dumper</a>. Oh, and her husband and many of his besties were revealed to have deep ties with <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/sf-culture/article/i-wonder-why-trump-wont-release-epstein-files-20772363.php">the world’s most notorious child molester</a>.</p>
<p>Again, this list is incomplete. It doesn’t include things like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Reporter: Do you plan to apologize to the family of Alex Pretti?</p>
<p>Vance: For what?</p>
<p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:h7qtoo7nxqxarrsijohjhbw4/post/3me25hopiqq2p?ref_src=embed">[image or embed]</a></p>

</blockquote>
<p>So I watched “Melania” and could only think of how extravagantly wasteful everything about it is, especially in light of the damage her husband is inflicting on the ground. Ratner hired <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/q-and-a/what-a-melania-cinematographer-hoped-to-accomplish">three of the best cinematographers in the world</a> to help make him look like an actual director. Their efforts, while gorgeous on screen, go to waste. As does everything else involved with this vanity production: the remarkable design efforts of Melania’s personal cadre of Tim Gunns, the work of all those stagehands and caterers, the gallons upon gallons of fuel used to transport Mrs. Trump from one gilded space to another, the good faith of the holy men greeting the First Lady at St. Patrick’s Cathedral, the invites, the elegant places settings and the caviar. All of it may as well have been thrown into an incinerator.</p>

<p>I felt that waste even more keenly in the back half of the film, which takes us through Trump’s second inauguration seemingly in real time. I had to listen to President-elect Trump complain that the CFP national title game was taking place the same day as his inauguration. I had to watch him dance with Melania like he was about to topple over onto her (my son: “He stands in italics”). I had to watch all of the gross, smiling faces in attendance that night. Look at them pretend everything is wonderful. Look at them laugh while the world they run burns. And look at Melania Trump, always in the center of the frame, pretending she’s at a cool remove from all of it. It was f—king gross. All of it. These people are gross, and they deserve none of the shine they spend all day basking in. They deserve tribunals, and soon.</p>
<p>So I’m back in my Philly hotel room, getting my gummy on and soaking up whatever sunshine I can. And then I remember my drive home from my “Melania” showing, and I remember seeing a big ICE OUT banner that someone hung from a highway overpass. When I think about that sign, and the people who made it, the light on my face feels just that much brighter.</p>
