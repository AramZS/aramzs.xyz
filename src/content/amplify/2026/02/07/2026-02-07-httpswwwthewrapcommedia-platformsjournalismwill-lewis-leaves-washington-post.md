<p>The Washington Post said on Saturday that its CEO and publisher Will Lewis will leave the paper and its chief financial officer, Jeff D’Onofrio, will step up as interim CEO and publisher.</p>
<p>The changes are effective immediately. His exit comes three days after the Jeff Bezos-owned paper<a href="https://www.thewrap.com/media-platforms/journalism/washington-post-layoffs-jeff-bezos-2/"> laid off a third of the company</a>, including more than 300 journalists, after years of financial struggles.</p>
<p>“After two years of transformation at The Washington Post, now is the right time for me to step aside,” Lewis wrote to staff in a memo. “I want to thank Jeff Bezos for his support and leadership throughout my tenure as CEO and Publisher. The institution could not have a better owner.”</p>

<p>Lewis joined the paper in January 2024, replacing publisher Fred Ryan. D’Onofrio joined the paper in June last year.</p>
<p>Bezos said in a statement that the Post “has an essential journalistic mission and an extraordinary opportunity” and that the paper would be well served by D’Onofrio, executive editor Matt Murray and opinion editor Adam O’Neal. He did not mention Lewis.</p>
<p>“Each and every day our readers give us a roadmap to success. The data tells us what is valuable and where to focus,” Bezos said in a statement, his first since the paper’s layoffs on Wednesday. “Jeff, along with Matt and Adam, are positioned to lead The Post into an exciting and thriving next chapter.”</p>
<p>Murray announced the widespread layoffs — which saw the sports and books sections cut and the gutting of the foreign, metro and arts section — in an early-morning Zoom call on Wednesday. Lewis did not participate in the Zoom call as he had “a lot of things to tend to,” Murray <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/washington-posts-top-editor-backs-bezos-critics-lash-out-over-struggling-papers-layoffs">told</a> Fox News on Wednesday.</p>
<p>However, Athletic reporter and Post sports alum Nicki Jhabvala posted a photo of Lewis at Thursday’s NFL Honors award show in San Francisco ahead of the Super Bowl. The photo drew <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/industry-news/business/will-lewis-washington-post-super-bowl/">widespread criticism</a> from current and former Post staffers.</p>
<p>Lewis’ arrival at the Post in 2024 came after the paper had gone through rounds of <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/washington-posts-new-boss-will-lewis-is-walking-into-an-epic-mess/">layoffs, buyouts and clashes between management and the paper’s union</a>. A former Rupert Murdoch executive who served as the publisher of the Wall Street Journal, Lewis <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/media/2023/11/05/william-lewis-washington-post-ceo-profile/">told the Post’s media team</a> in an interview after his hiring announcement that the paper would “grow again” and “get that confidence back and that swagger back” after the paper cut 240 jobs through buyouts as it lost $100 million in 2023.</p>
<p>But his two-year tenure was marred by controversy. Lewis said in June 2024 that then-executive editor Sally Buzbee would leave the paper, weeks after he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/05/business/media/washington-post-buzbee-lewis.html">reportedly spoke to her</a> about the paper’s coverage of a lawsuit involving his alleged role in covering up a phone-hacking scandal at Murdoch’s U.K. papers. (Lewis has long denied the allegations.) Lewis also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/06/business/media/washington-post-will-lewis-npr.html">promised</a> an exclusive interview with NPR media correspondent David Folkenflik if he dropped a story on the allegations. Folkenflik declined, and Lewis then <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/media/2024/06/06/post-publisher-draws-more-scrutiny-after-newsroom-shakeup/">claimed</a> to the Post that Folkenflik was more “an activist, not a journalist.”</p>
<p>He then appointed Murray as interim executive editor ahead of the 2024 election, after which former Telegraph editor and Lewis colleague Robert Winnett would replace him. Murray would then transition to lead a “third newsroom” focused on social media and service journalism, one of Lewis’ signature ideas to try and boost the paper’s financial prospects. But Winnett decided <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/media/2024/06/21/robert-winnett-steps-down-washington-post-lewis-buzbee/">not to join the paper</a> after media coverage, including <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2024/06/16/washington-post-editor-robert-winnett/">some by the Post’s media desk,</a> scrutinized his ethical practices as a U.K. journalist.</p>
<p>Many of his plans to boost the paper’s finances never took off. The paper laid off roughly 100 business staffers last year and instituted another round of buyouts, and the third newsroom, later named “WP Ventures,” did not gain much traction. Several top reporters, editors and executives — <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/washington-post-exits-tiktok-guy-wp-ventures-third-newsroom/">including the head of WP Ventures</a> — also took buyouts or left for jobs at the Atlantic, the New York Times and the Journal, among other organizations.</p>
<p>Lewis’ remarks to staff also inflamed his relationship with the Post’s employees. He told Post staffers that “people are not reading your stuff” as he unveiled his two new editors, and after Winnett withdrew from joining the Post, Lewis went into what multiple staffers <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/05/26/is-jeff-bezos-selling-out-the-washington-post">told</a> the New Yorker was “a state of hiding.”</p>
<p>Multiple Post staffers who spoke to TheWrap expressed glee at Lewis’ departure, with one saying it was “really great he finally left.”</p>
<p>“It leaves some small hope that we’ve hit rock bottom,” another Post staffer said. “But I’ve thought that before.”</p>
<p>D’Onofrio acknowledged the “hard week of change” at the paper in a note to staffers on Saturday, and he said the paper under his leadership would pair its “uncompromising, fearless journalism” with “building a sustainable business.”</p>
<p>“I’m honored to take the helm as acting Publisher and CEO to lead us into a sustainable, successful future with the strength of our journalism as our north star,” D’Onofrio wrote. “I look forward to working shoulder to shoulder with all of you to make that happen.”</p>
