<p>Measles is considered highly contagious and can be spread through the air when an infected person breathes, sneezes or coughs, DC Health says. It is also preventable with the Measles, Mumps, Rubella (MMR) vaccine.</p>
<p>Nine out of 10 unvaccinated people who are exposed to measles will become infected, according to DC Health.

<h2>What to do if you're exposed</h2>
<p>Anyone who has not received a measles containing vaccine — either the the measles, mumps,<br/>
and rubella (MMR) vaccine or a measles only vaccine — is at risk for contracting measles. People who fall into this category and have been exposed should contact their health care provider or DC Health at 844-493-2652, officials said.</p>
<p>Immunocompromised people who may have been exposed should check with their doctor, DC Health said, especially if symptoms start to develop.</p>
<p>Anyone who has had two doses of a measles containing vaccine or was born before 1957 is considered protected and does not need to take any action, according to DC Health. If you have received only one dose, you are most likely protected, but health officials advise talking to a health care provider about receiving a second dose for full immunity.</p>
<p>People who are at risk and have been exposed should watch out for symptoms for 21 days after the exposure. If symptoms appear, isolate immediately and then call your healthcare provider, DC Health said. If it is necessary to see the healthcare provider in person or go to the emergency room, call ahead of time so they can protect staff and other patients.</p>
<h2>What are the symptoms?</h2>
<p>Symptoms of measles develop over two stages.</p>
<p>The first stage typically begins seven to 14 days after exposure. Here are some common symptoms, according to DC Health:</p>
<p>The second stage starts three to five days after the initial symptoms begin and is marked by a rash on the face, which then spreads to the rest of the body.</p>
<p>A person with measles is contagious from four days before this rash appears until four days after it appeared, according to DC Health.</p>
