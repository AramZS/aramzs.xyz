<p>YouTube has announced that it will start using AI to upscale low-quality videos with a new “Super Resolution” feature coming soon.</p>
<p>In a blog post today, YouTube announced a few new features coming to the platform. These include some TV updates, such as “immersive” homepage previews and new contextual search that shows results from a specific channel when you start the search on that channel. Videos with shopping links will also now include a QR code to view those products on your phone.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most interesting new change, though, is the addition of AI-upscaling on YouTube videos that are of low-quality, with the upgrade being called “Super Resolution.”</p>
<p>If a video is below 1080p, YouTube will start automatically generating higher resolution versions of that video. YouTube says the “goal” is to support resolutions up to 4K. If a video is in low quality, higher resolution versions will be called “Super Resolution.”</p>

<p>YouTube explains that this is automatic, but that creators can opt out, and that viewers can go back to the original resolution.</p>
<blockquote> <p>We’re also <strong>introducing a new AI-powered feature that automatically generates higher resolutions for videos.</strong> We’re starting with videos uploaded below 1080p, upscaling them from SD to HD, with the goal to support resolutions up to 4K in the near future. Creators will retain complete control over their library, as both original files and original video resolution will be kept intact, with a clear option to <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/16619284">opt-out</a> of these enhancements. And viewers will still be able to watch creators’ videos in the original uploaded resolution, as super resolution will be clearly labeled under settings.</p> </blockquote>
