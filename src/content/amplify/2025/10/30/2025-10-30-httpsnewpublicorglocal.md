<p>Just like parks, libraries, and community centers play a critical role in healthy local communities and democratic culture — deepening trust, connecting people across difference, building resilience to disasters, and creating the space for people to act together to improve things — <strong>we believe that every local community should have an enduring digital public space.</strong></p>
<p>Your town might have an email listserv, discussion forum, or group page on a social platform. These spaces already do a lot of really critical and useful community work. They’re where people find their pets and babysitters, talk about civic problems to solve, surface and discuss community news, and invite people to the neighborhood block party.</p>
<p>But these volunteer-run, under-resourced efforts can be incredibly fragile. We’re working to make these kinds of spaces healthier and more resilient. We know from sociologists and political scientists that it is these kinds of spaces — local, non-state institutions — that strengthen the muscles necessary for democratic citizenship, democratic culture, and democratic process.</p>

<h3>Our Approach</h3>
<p>We believe that by strengthening the capacity of the people who lead and care for these spaces — we call them community stewards — we can significantly and empirically improve local cohesion, civic engagement, and community trust. Over the next three years, we’ll focus on building solutions in three areas:</p>
<ul> <li><b>👩🏻‍🤝‍👩🏿 People</b>. Recruit more great stewards by telling the story of why this work matters and developing resourcing models to make their care work more sustainable.<br/> </li> <li><b>📖 Practices: </b>Build a guild for stewards that codifies and shares <a href="https://newpublic.notion.site/Creating-a-Flourishing-Digital-Public-Space-for-Your-Local-Area-6e563c345c494cceb1b95f6dfd282519">best practices</a> for public-spirited stewardship of local digital spaces. Just like journalism or library science, the best stewards will be able to rely on a range of proven approaches, ethics, and practices.<br/> </li> <li><b>🛠 Platforms.</b> After experimenting with <a href="https://newpublic.substack.com/p/reviving-the-community-newsletter">building on top of existing platforms</a>, we’re now in the early stages of designing and building new online tools for local community connection. You can learn more about that work <a href="https://localstewards.newpublic.org/">here</a>.</li> </ul>
<figure></figure><p>“Doshi and Pariser have zeroed in on what they see as some of the most civically productive, practically useful pockets scattered across the various platforms constituting social media today: community-oriented ad-hoc groups.”</p>
<h3>Resources for Stewards</h3>
<p><a href="https://localstewards.newpublic.org/"><strong>Join our Community Launchpad program</strong></a></p>
<p>Looking to start a new online space for your town or neighborhood, without the noise or toxicity of big social media platforms? As we begin building a tool to help local communities come together online, this program will provide support and funding to a handful of local leaders who are excited to explore alongside us and pilot it in their local area.</p>
<p>If you lead or are considering starting a local online group or space — whether that’s a Facebook group for your neighborhood, a Discord server for your city, or something similar — and strive to make it inclusive, uplifting, and public-spirited, our new guide is for you.</p>
<p>Inside you’ll find hands-on, practical recommendations from other stewards: advice about getting started, ideas for practices that build social trust &amp; and belonging, tips on moderation and handling conflict, and much more. We’ll continue to update it, with your help, as we learn more and continue to explore these spaces.</p>
