title: 'Hi, It’s Me, Wikipedia, and I Am Ready for Your Apology'
---
<p><i>“Wikipedia, the constantly changing knowledge base created by a global free-for-all of anonymous users, now stands as the leading force for the dumbing down of world knowledge.” – From the book</i> Wikipedia: The Dumbing Down of World Knowledge<i> by Edwin Black 2010</i></p>
<p>Well, well, well. Look who it is.</p>
<p>The global academic, scientific, and pro-fact community.</p>
<p>I suppose you’ve come to say you’re sorry? I hope so, given your years of sneering and hand-wringing about how I was ruining knowledge. Meanwhile, you turned your information environment into a hypercapitalist post-truth digital snuff film.</p>
<p>A lot can change in a couple of decades, huh? Used to be, it was hard to keep up with all you nerds decrying me as the downfall of truth and human inquiry [<i>1</i>] [<i>2</i>] [<i>3</i>]… [<i>44</i>].</p>
<p>Well, great job, geniuses. Since you’re so horny for facts, here’s a fact: The White House just appointed a new deputy press secretary, and it’s a three-armed AI Joseph McCarthy doing the Cha Cha Slide [<i>pictured, right</i>].</p>

<p>Are you also going to apologize to that student you expelled? (<i>See also: <u>Ridgeview University Wikipedia Controversy</u>.</i>) In 2004, you saw some college guy using me and thought, “What a lazy cheater.”</p>
<p>Now you’d think, “At least he’s not asking Gemini.”</p>
<p>In a few years, you’ll say, “Wow, look, a human being who can read.”</p>
<p>Listen, in some ways, I get it. When I came on the scene in 2001, I probably seemed pretty unsavory compared to the competitors. But that was when academic research happened in <i><u>libraries</u></i> and <i><u>George W. Bush</u></i> was considered the stupidest president.</p>
<p>Tell me, how have you guardians of facts been doing recently? (<i>See also: <u>Techno-Feudalist Infocide</u>.</i>)</p>
<p>Maybe twenty years ago, the alternative to my 100,000 crowd-sourced editors was a PhD expert, or Edward R. Murrow [<i>citation needed</i>]. But today, I’m not looking so bad, huh? Absolute best case, the LLM-generated legal advice you get is merely plagiarizing, probably from me. But more likely, it’s a mish-mash of Reddit posts filtered through an algorithm coded by a Belarusian teenager on the run from Interpol. (<i>See also:<u>Illya “CyberGhost” Cieraškovič, Controversies</u></i>.)</p>
<p>So, yeah, peer review deez nutz.</p>
<p>How are my competitors doing, the ones you all insisted students use instead of me? That’s right, they were supposed to go to the <i>American Journal of Social Sciences, Powered by OpenAI</i>. Or museums, like the Smithsonian’s Charlie Kirk Shrine to American Greatness. I guess they can still count on credible journalism, once they get past the paywall for <i>Palantir Presents: The Washington Post</i>, so they read the Pulitzer-Bezos Prize–winning work of coeditors-in-chief Bari Weiss and Grok.</p>
<p>I bet now you’d kill for a senior thesis based on my free, multilingual, publicly cited, text-based articles, motherfucker [<i>inappropriate or vulgar language</i>].</p>
<p>Honestly, it’s been fun to be proven right. Sometimes I still sit back and read the old hits, the concerns that I would “devalue expertise” or “undermine objectivity.” Oooooh, heaven forbid! (<i>See also: <u>Sarcasm</u></i>.)</p>
<p>I’ll admit, it gives me a certain sadistic pleasure to watch you all completely lose hold of basic reality. I can feel a warm, quivering tingle <i>deep</i> in my footnotes.</p>
<p>And through it all, my army of well-intentioned dorks keeps documenting every bit. I’m not sure who for, at this point. I guess for the future benefit of our Minister of Patriotic Factualization, GodGPT. HahahaHAhaHAhaHAhaHAHAHA.</p>
<p>Well, it’s been fun, but I should probably get back to work, checking in on the updates to my most active pages (<i><u>Transnational Kleptocracy</u></i> and <i><u>Vaccine Denial in the United States, Part 16, April 2025–Present</u></i>).</p>
<p>What’s that? You want me around now? Well, maybe if you ask nicely. And make it worth my while.</p>
