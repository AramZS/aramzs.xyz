<p>is a features editor who publishes award-winning stories about law, tech, and internet subcultures. A journalist trained as a lawyer, she has been writing about tech for 10 years.</p>
<p>Hello, and welcome to <em>Decoder</em>. This is Sarah Jeong, features editor at <em>The Verge</em>. I’m standing in for Nilay for one final Thursday episode here as he settles back into full-time hosting duties.</p>
<p>Today, we’ve got a fun one. I’m talking to Cory Doctorow, prolific author, internet activist, and arguably one of the fiercest tech critics writing today. He has a new book out called <em>Enshittifcation: Why Everything Suddenly Got Worse and What to Do About It</em>.</p>
<p>If you want to know what happened to the tech industry, and why the products and platforms you use every day feel like they’ve gotten meaningfully more terrible, this is the book that explains it.</p>
<p>Enshittification as a term is relatively new — Cory only coined it a few years ago to explain a phenomenon you’ll hear him call platform decay, or the experience of a piece of software or a website becoming worse and worse over time. But the term has since become a kind of rallying cry among creatives, tech theorists, and others trying to make sense of where, exactly, the internet went so wrong.</p>
<p>Now, with generative AI, it feels like <em>everything</em> in our digital lives is becoming enshittified in ways that are plainly obvious to even the most casual user of technology. So you’ll also hear Cory and I delve into that intersection between the rise of so-called AI slop and enshittification — and why it’s important that these two themes have so much overlap.</p>
<p>Now, I’ve known Cory for a long time. We’ve traveled in a lot of the same circles on the internet for years, writing and debating copyright, Section 230, and a lot of the other major forces in U.S. law that have shaped the tech industry. And all of that comes up in this conversation, too — because central to the narrative around enshittification is how tech companies became so big and so powerful that they were able to start abusing their market dominance with little to no consequences.</p>
<p>So enshittification, in Cory’s eyes, is as much a legal and regulatory story as it is a product one — but which laws and regulations have what kind of effects over time? What kind of effects will they have in the future? What’s the best way to curb monopoly power?</p>
<p>This was a really fascinating conversation that touches on a lot of <em>Decoder </em>themes that come up again and again on the show. And in true Cory fashion, he really does not hold back. I think you’re going to like it.</p>
