<p>Roberts, whose group <a data-tracking="mpos=center&amp;mid=ar_body&amp;lindex=68&amp;lcol=" href="https://www.heritage.org/progressivism/report/project-esther-national-strategy-combat-antisemitism">launched “Project Esther”</a> to combat antisemitism, also said “Christians can critique the state of Israel without being antisemitic. And of course, antisemitism should be condemned.”</p>
<p>The Heritage Foundation leader’s public support of Carlson comes as the former Fox News host faces backlash from conservatives over an inflammatory interview with Fuentes that was laced with antisemitism. Carlson said GOP supporters of Israel — including U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) — suffer from a “brain virus,” while Fuentes said the “big challenge” to unifying the country was “organized Jewry.”</p>
<p>Huckabee, who is set to speak at this weekend’s Republican Jewish Coalition annual leadership conference in Las Vegas, dismissed the criticism.</p>
<p>“Wasn’t aware that Tucker despises me. I do get that a lot from people not familiar with the Bible or history. Somehow I will survive this animosity,” Huckabee <a data-tracking="mpos=center&amp;mid=ar_body&amp;lindex=69&amp;lcol=" href="https://x.com/GovMikeHuckabee/status/1983069889079247344?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1983069889079247344%7Ctwgr%5Ef5954802908507fd01b0019f1f2185a4156aa25e%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fnypost.com%2F2025%2F10%2F28%2Fus-news%2Fmike-huckabee-fires-back-at-tucker-carlsons-offensive-rant-about-brain-virus-of-christian-zionism%2F">posted on X</a>.</p>
<p>Cruz defended Huckabee in <a data-tracking="mpos=center&amp;mid=ar_body&amp;lindex=70&amp;lcol=" href="https://x.com/tedcruz/status/1983175011646226899">his own post</a>. The former governor “is a pastor and a patriot who loves America, loves Israel, and loves Jesus. I’m proud to be in his company,” Cruz said.</p>
<p>Roberts and Carlson did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Fuentes could not be reached for comment.</p>
<p>The furor over the Fuentes sitdown comes as Republicans wrestle with how to respond to a string of antisemitic incidents on the right. POLITICO <a data-tracking="mpos=center&amp;mid=ar_body&amp;lindex=71&amp;lcol=" href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/14/private-chat-among-young-gop-club-members-00592146">first reported</a> two weeks ago on an explosive Telegram group chat in which leaders of various Young Republican groups joked about the Holocaust and lauded Adolf Hitler. A day later, a staffer for Rep. Dave Taylor’s (R-Ohio) joined a virtual meeting with a <a data-tracking="mpos=center&amp;mid=ar_body&amp;lindex=72&amp;lcol=" href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/15/capitol-police-investigating-swastika-in-gop-congressional-office-00609704">flag featuring a Nazi symbol</a> visible behind him.</p>
