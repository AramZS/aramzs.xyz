<p>Eight minutes past 1am on December 30, 1999. A digital whir, the sound of a disc spinning faster and faster. “You ready?” a voice asks. “Yeah,” another responds. An eye blinks, then shuts. “Boot it.”</p>
<p>Static in our field of vision, then the noise clears. We’re in the back of a car. Nighttime. Are those our hands being given a gun? “You give me this <em>piece of shit?</em>” yells the person whose eyes we’re looking through. “OK, just relax!” the driver shouts. Everyone has pantyhose over their heads. We pull into a back alley. “Two, three, <em>go!</em>”</p>
<p>And so begins Kathryn Bigelow’s 1995 cyberpunk neo-noir techno-thriller <a href="https://boxd.it/2aGO"><em>Strange Days</em></a>: a three-minute sequence of an armed robbery at a Thai restaurant gone wrong. Bigelow loves a robbery—but where <a href="https://boxd.it/2958"><em>Point Break</em></a>’s bank robbery is a pleasurable spectacle choreographed with virtuosic grace, <em>Strange Days</em> throws us into a completely different cinematic landscape. The audience watches this rampage unfold not from some privileged viewpoint, but as if we’re the ones holding the gun. Already, what pierces through the film’s sensorial overwhelm is one of Bigelow’s many statements of intent: to bring us closer, maybe even too close, to the action.</p>
<figure><div class="rw-embed-wrapper"><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vK3KZiJSFHs" type="video/mp4"/></div></figure>
<p>Over its two-and-a-half-hour runtime, <em>Strange Days</em> might be “A FIVE-COURSE MEAL,” if you love it <a href="https://boxd.it/4f0hjL">like Alex</a>, or it might prompt questions like, <a href="https://boxd.it/bhHbGf">per Wetdavid</a>, “What is happening, where am I and why is the lighting designed this way?” It’s the final days of the millennium in Los Angeles, and a radio station caller warns that the world will end at midnight on New Year’s Eve. Tanks cruise the street; riot cops brutalize civilians in alleyways; two women accost a fleeing Santa Claus and punch him in the gut. The militarized city is so saturated with violence that it becomes background noise. Another caller, Dewayne, has a message for the police. “Hey yo Five-O, you better get down with the 2K … History is gonna start right here, right now.”</p>
<p>Driving with the radio on is Lenny Nero, an ex-cop turned black-market salesman, played by Ralph Fiennes wearing leather pants (<a href="https://boxd.it/bcb4RV">Ninewhile99 counts this</a> as “a <em><a href="https://boxd.it/AO8q">Conclave</a></em> thirst watch”). Lenny deals in illegal, virtual hyper-reality clips taped on a SQUID, or Superconducting Quantum Interference Device: a headset that allows wearers to record everything they see, hear, touch, and feel “right from the cerebral cortex” onto a MiniDisc. “This is not ‘like TV, only better,’” Lenny’s sales pitch goes. “This is <em>life</em>.”</p>
<p>Initially developed as federal surveillance technology, it’s now used to peddle sex, violence and general sleaze. Between selling these clips to yuppie-types seeking escapism through the gnarliness of other people’s lives, Lenny himself obsessively replays SQUID clips of his ex-girlfriend Faith (Juliette Lewis), a singer with whom he’s still in love.</p>
<p>The vibes? Neon, rain-slick, and pulled between a spiraling nihilism and forward-looking fury. <em>Strange Days</em> is in good company with <a href="https://boxd.it/1XBQ"><em>Johnny Mnemonic</em></a> and <a href="https://boxd.it/29qK"><em>Total Recall</em></a> on Patrick’s <a href="https://boxd.it/BKCg">Y2K Futurism</a> list, while <a href="https://boxd.it/3F2YV9">Josh points out</a> it remains the “only movie in existence that has Juliette Lewis doing a neon-punk ’90s PJ Harvey [...] between horrifying POV virtual reality snuff films.” (Lewis performs <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX3CmKvzyw0&amp;list=RDKX3CmKvzyw0&amp;start_radio=1">an unforgettable, angst-and-sex-drenched cover</a> of Harvey’s ‘Hardly Wait’: Let this, if nothing else, convince you to watch <em>Strange Days</em>.) <a href="https://boxd.it/9E1dWB">Ben</a> “can’t elaborate but this movie has the same vibe as Scooby Doo,” while <a href="https://boxd.it/3DBK5P">Bryan gives us</a> a great logline: “a cyberpunk <a href="https://boxd.it/1TlE"><em>Blow Out</em></a> tinged with the hope that things could ever change.”</p>

<p>When Faith’s friend, sex worker Iris (Brigitte Bako), comes to Lenny on the run from the cops, he and his PI buddy Max (Tom Sizemore in a heinous wig) and badass friend Mace, an armored limousine driver and bodyguard, are pulled into a dark conspiracy. Angela Bassett is legendary as Mace, the film’s emotional and moral core; she detests Lenny’s “wirehead crap” and considers him a “pussy-whipped sorry-ass motherfucker” for his inability to move on from the past. And not for nothing, as <a href="https://boxd.it/10Uqgz">Kristen muses</a>, her “toned arms really carried this movie.” (Bassett had just gotten ripped to play Tina Turner in the 1993 biopic <a href="https://boxd.it/1Lzo"><em>What’s Love Got to Do with It</em></a>.)</p>
<p>Though James Cameron, Bigelow’s producing and romantic partner at the time, started on the story in 1986, <em>Strange Days</em>’ script was written after the 1992 Los Angeles uprising. Four LAPD officers who had violently beaten Rodney King, a Black man <a href="https://projects.scpr.org/timelines/la-riots-25-years-later/">pulled over for speeding</a>, were acquitted of all charges, igniting six days of riots across the city—Bigelow’s involvement with the cleanup significantly informed <em>Strange Days</em>. “The riots were a real emotional time for anybody living here,” the filmmaker <a href="https://www.artforum.com/features/reality-bytes-202372/">told <em>Artforum</em></a>. “Being on the streets with burned-out shells of buildings and the National Guard milling around suggested a lot of the film’s visual basis.”</p>
<p>In <em>Strange Days</em>, a vision of LA set only four years into the future, the city reels from the murder of prominent musician and Black revolutionary Jeriko One, played by Glenn Plummer. His death, attributed to gang violence, is all over the news. “The LAPD is a military force turned against its own people!” we hear in a TV replay of one of his speeches.</p>

<p>Currently #141 in our <a href="https://boxd.it/fSeHs">Top 250 Science Fiction Films</a>, <em>Strange Days </em>remains a dark horse compared to other ’90s sci-fi heavyweights. Bigelow’s follow-up to the wildly successful <em>Point Break</em>, <em>Strange Days</em> bombed at the box office—grossing $17 million against its $42 million budget—and nearly ended the director’s career. But 30 years later, its church has some pretty strong believers. <a href="https://boxd.it/zld0"><em>Challengers</em></a> screenwriter Justin Kuritzkes ranks it in his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txqCkBN35U4">four favorites</a>, saying that as much as he loves <a href="https://boxd.it/2a1m"><em>The Matrix</em></a>, it’s “the quintessential cyberpunk movie of the ’90s.” Far eclipsing <em>Strange Days</em> in popularity, <em>The Matrix </em>might nevertheless owe some inspiration to Bigelow’s film, like the lingo of “jacking in” to a virtual reality. (Certainly, both films exist on a continuum—Sternwise’s list of <a href="https://boxd.it/mY3k">Cybertronic Movies</a> traces the interfacing between body-as-meat and machine back to 1896 with Louis Lumiere’s <a href="https://boxd.it/5JEu"><em>The Mechanical Butcher</em></a>.)</p>
<p>One reason for <em>Strange Days</em>’ reappraisal is the feeling it was ahead of its time. <a href="https://boxd.it/C69e"><em>How to Blow Up a Pipeline</em></a> director Daniel Goldhaber calls it “<a href="https://boxd.it/1xOw9f">prophetic</a>” in a Letterboxd review (while <em>Pipeline </em>star, co-writer, and co-producer Ariela Barer also drops it in their <a href="https://creators.spotify.com/pod/profile/letterboxd/episodes/Four-Favorites-with-Ariela-Barer-Blade-Runner--conformists--pipelines-and-Almodvar-e22vakb/a-a9nm6f2">four faves</a>). Nevertheless, <a href="https://boxd.it/LKajR">Theshrillest suggests</a> that cyberpunk isn’t really about the future: It’s “about the present, a present refracted through and magnified by technology and defamiliarized just enough that we are able to see it anew.” Isaac’s list <a href="https://boxd.it/ApnOy">The future is the past now</a> captures an additional dimension: Those real presents and imagined futures are gone. Many things have changed, but perhaps even more have stayed the same.</p>
<p>Though ‘SQUID’ sounds like your typical science-fiction acronym, it’s a real device that detects miniscule changes in magnetic fields, and like in the film, SQUIDs were actually marketed for <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/41389854?read-now=1&amp;seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents">military and surveillance</a> applications due to their ability to create an environmental record of bodily movement. <em>Strange Days</em>’ ‘refraction’ of the present, then, is about the circulation of surveillance technologies between state, corporation, and individuals—about who has access to the means of recording. From magnetic sensors and CCTV to home video, to the greatest-ever mass surveillance invention, the smartphone, the question is: Who is watching whom?</p>

<p>The Rodney King case was exceptional not because state-sanctioned violence against Black people was out of the ordinary, but because an eyewitness caught King’s beating in full-on videotape. The mass circulation of this footage, “<a href="https://www.npr.org/2017/04/26/524744989/when-la-erupted-in-anger-a-look-back-at-the-rodney-king-riots">ocular proof</a>” of police brutality, felt like a watershed moment. In <em>Strange Days</em>, it’s revealed that the police are pursuing Iris because she was with Jeriko One and wearing a SQUID at the time of his murder, inadvertently recording it: In one of the film’s ‘playbacks,’ we watch through her eyes as two white police officers shoot Jeriko point-blank during a traffic stop. “Do you know what this tape could do if it got out? People seeing that the LAPD just flat-out executed Jeriko One?” Mace says to Lenny. The grief in her voice tightens into tremulous, coiled anger. “Maybe they ought to see.”</p>
<p>We have since lived through multiple cycles of videos of police killings failing to secure justice. We know people will protest, riot, spill into the streets, but the fact the police can be watched as they kill has not stemmed their ability to do so. At the time of writing, according to <a href="https://mappingpoliceviolence.org/">Mapping Police Violence</a>, there have only been three days in 2025 where police did not kill someone in the US. One of the biggest waves of protest in history has come and gone in the wake of George Floyd’s murder in 2020, after the nine-minute footage of a police officer suffocating Floyd with a knee on his neck, filmed on a bystander’s phone, was seen by millions worldwide. What does it mean to put a video like this into circulation?</p>
<p>A <a href="https://pr.fd.org/sites/pr/files/training/AmsterdamStories%20Told%20and%20Untold.pdf">legal review</a> of the Rodney King verdict suggests the jury’s acquittal might have arisen from their desensitization to the footage: As they watched King’s beating repeatedly in slow-motion, it became as familiar “as a cereal advertisement.” (Now, even video’s capacity to prove the truth is rapidly eroding. Earlier this month, the dangerously regulation-avoidant OpenAI launched Sora, a social media platform for AI-generated deepfakes using real people’s likenesses. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/04/openai-sora-violence-racism">Within days</a>, it was flooded with violent, racist, and misogynistic videos.)</p>

<p>Today, social media flattens the viscerality of state violence, from police brutality to genocide, into coexistence with dance trends and memes; everything is ‘engagement.’ In <em>Strange Days</em>’ most controversial scene, we watch the playback of a SQUID-wearing attacker who rapes and strangles Iris to death, forcing her to wear a SQUID and experience her assault from his point of view. Whether the film earns the right to show us something this horrific remains up for discussion (<a href="https://boxd.it/5pFUOj">Demi senses</a> a perversity in Bigelow’s choices, “like a child magnifying ants in the sun”), but we are more implicated in the economy of violent images than we like to believe.</p>
<p>Though this scene was condemned upon release (<a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=6OQCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA60&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false"><em>New York </em>magazine</a> called it “the sickest sequence in modern movies”), Roger Ebert, who gave the film <a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/strange-days-1995">four out of four stars</a>, praised Bigelow’s ability to pull back the curtain, “[forcing] her audience to deal with the screen reality, instead of allowing us to process it as routine ‘action.’” Contemporarily, our seamless experience on social media is owed to the labor of data workers and content moderators in the Global South, who are <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/apr/27/meta-moderator-on-the-cost-of-viewing-beheadings-child-abuse-and-suicide">subjected to the darkest videos on the internet</a>, like this fictional one in <em>Strange Days</em>, of sexual violence, graphic murder and child abuse.</p>
<p>The film’s address to a video-compulsive society remains incisive. <em>Strange Days</em> speaks to our “desire to watch, to experience vicariously,” <a href="https://www.artforum.com/features/reality-bytes-202372/">Bigelow has said</a>. “There’s a tremendous gluttony for images right now; that hunger to experience somebody else’s life instead of our own is so palpable. What else is the appetite for cinema?” (See also: Ethan’s <a href="https://boxd.it/bckRI">list of films that ‘anticipated the notion of being too online.’</a>)</p>

<p>This question captures Bigelow’s filmmaking at its best and most self-reflexive. <a href="https://bfidatadigipres.github.io/woman%20with%20a%20movie%20camera/2023/12/05/strange-days/">Grappling with </a>“both the fascination and repulsion of cinema,” it translates political critique about the nature of cinema into barn-burner entertainment. The director’s obsession with new ways of seeing required purpose-built camera equipment: Bigelow and <em>Strange Days</em> cinematographer Matt Leonetti <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/43455118?read-now=1&amp;seq=3#page_scan_tab_contents">spent over a year</a> developing a light, mobile camera with follow-focus capacity to make the POV sequences resemble the movement of the human eye. (For more cinematic innovations in perception, we have Eli’s list, <a href="https://boxd.it/N4lc">new light, new sight: the novel eye</a>.)</p>
<p>Some members now look back on <em>Strange Days </em>differently after Bigelow’s technical obsessions were eventually used to normalize the militarized psyche of post-9/11 America. 2008’s <a href="https://boxd.it/1Soi"><em>The Hurt Locker</em></a> was filmed with a hand-held realism: a mode of feverish immediacy that stylistically evokes documentary ‘neutrality,’ dehistoricizing the US imperialist war that led to the death of an <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-24547256">estimated 461,000 Iraqis</a>. While some members praise Bigelow’s filmmaking in her Best Picture winner for its <a href="https://boxd.it/38m8J9">suspense</a> and <a href="https://boxd.it/8ugkWP">tension</a>, <a href="https://boxd.it/bqAANd">Fifth Sip says</a> it “depicts Iraq like an FPS [first-person shooter] level,” and <a href="https://boxd.it/5xvC3L">Sam calls</a> it “racist jingoistic drivel made by basically the only director to ever carve out a uniquely American artistry in the action genre.”</p>
<p>Reviewing <em>Strange Days </em>in 2025, <a href="https://boxd.it/boFyy3">Brannon writes</a> that it doesn’t “hit nearly as hard [...] on rewatch,” adding: “How am I supposed to take this film seriously when I know it’s coming from the queen of pro-cop/US military propaganda?”</p>

<p>“You can keep your movie that made Kathryn Bigelow the first woman to win Best Director at the Oscars,” <a href="https://boxd.it/rcKQz">Graham writes</a> on <em>Strange Days</em>. “I’ll stick with the one that made her the first woman to win Best Director at the Saturn Awards.” Though viewers who are critical of Bigelow’s more recent work might be surprised, <em>Strange Days</em> still mostly seethes in its indictment of state violence. And yet, the film takes a bewildering ‘not-all-cops’ turn that “kneecaps its political strengths to lib out at the end,” <a href="https://boxd.it/aN4rJV">per Zara</a>.</p>
<p>At the film’s climactic New Year’s Eve celebrations, the line between street party and police kettle is non-existent. Fireworks and gunshots ring out; what’s real and what’s entertainment is indistinguishable. Taiko drummers and bagpipers mark the false promises of crazed globalization; the world doesn’t feel bigger, but claustrophobic and small. Letterboxd member <a href="https://boxd.it/1zxtIb">Drew</a> was an extra during this NYE party, which at the time was <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1994-09-19-ca-40393-story.html">the largest rave ever held in the US</a>: “One of the craziest experiences I’ve ever had on a film set [...] It really was like an apocalyptic rave.”</p>

<p>Lenny, who had intended to trade the Jeriko tape to get back together with Faith, is convinced of his plan’s stupidity in the film’s most-quoted scene, famously <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub747pprmJ8">sampled by Fatboy Slim</a>. “This is your life! Right here, right now!” Mace yells at him. Echoing the words of the radio caller and Jeriko One, Mace’s “right here, right now” rips Lenny from his backward-looking solipsism and into a collective, political ‘now.’ Invigoratingly, <em>Strange Days</em> repeatedly juxtaposes white nihilism with Black revolutionary futurity. (Bigelow says, while this was “<a href="https://www.artforum.com/features/reality-bytes-202372/">certainly intentional</a>,” it was “by no means intended as an indictment of American white males.” They’ll live!)</p>
<p>Mace, in turn, is reluctantly convinced to hand the Jeriko tape to a police commissioner. Amid falling confetti and a throng of ravers, she disarms the cops who killed Jeriko before a police squad arrives and violently beats her with their batons: a direct citation of the Rodney King footage. The crowd looks on, stunned. Then, the wave breaks. A breathtaking bird’s-eye view shot (a cinematographic choice as formally opposed to the POV clips as it gets) sees a mass of bodies overpowering the police, refusing to be spectators, fighting the fuck back.</p>
<p>Then, the police commissioner arrests the two cops for Jeriko’s murder. Can I interest you in Sebastian’s list of <a href="https://boxd.it/N1ww">Movies Where White People Solve Racism</a>? “It’s very funny to me that this dark and archly cynical social satire ends on the conviction that if one simply gives the right knowledge to the right authorities, you can achieve something like justice,” <a href="https://boxd.it/4JNzvt">Jamelle wryly observes</a>. Bigelow <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Mk02URYEtOcC&amp;pg=PA42&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=1#v=snippet&amp;q=cannon&amp;f=false">said</a> she “wasn’t interested in tearing an institution apart,” emphasizing that the film is about “loose-cannon cops [acting] outside any authority.”</p>
<p>And yet, <em>Strange Days </em>keeps us coming back. <a href="https://boxd.it/38S5b3">Robert suggests</a> it’s because the film “perfectly captures the misplaced hope of its time.” But maybe it’s more the disappointment of its ending that feels familiar, despite Bigelow’s intention: that we have seen, time and time again, how a riot is always followed by its suppression, how the fires of a social movement are extinguished by the restoration of a violent status quo. We know, better than the film does, that the tape doesn’t save us—but if we listen for the revolutionary pulse of that New Year’s Eve crowd, we know what might. “Strange days, but for now, not estranged,” <a href="https://boxd.it/aX5K7X">Tim writes</a>. If all we have is right here, right now, what are we waiting for?</p>
