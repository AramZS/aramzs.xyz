<p>Andrew, the younger brother of King Charles III, will be stripped of his title as prince, Buckingham Palace said on Thursday, an extraordinary move that caps his fall from grace over his ties to the convicted sexual predator, Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
<p>In a statement, the palace said, “Prince Andrew will now be known as Andrew Mountbatten Windsor.” The palace also said Andrew, 65, would be evicted from his residence, Royal Lodge, and move to a private residence.</p>
<p>“These censures are deemed necessary, notwithstanding the fact that he continues to deny the allegations against him,” the palace said. “Their majesties wish to make clear that their thoughts and utmost sympathies have been, and will remain with, the victims and survivors of any and all forms of abuse.”</p>
