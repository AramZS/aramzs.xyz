  He is few critics’ idea of a respectable auteur, but his work is more
  consistently progressive than any other comic-book material today.

<p>Did you hear about the hybrid American–Nazi Germany flag on display in a U.S. government office? You would have seen it in the September 25 episode of <em>Peacemaker</em>, the satirical HBO superhero drama from James Gunn. Or you would have read about it this month courtesy of <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/15/capitol-police-investigating-swastika-in-gop-congressional-office-00609704">Politico</a>, which obtained a screenshot of a virtual meeting in which a U.S. flag “with altered red and white lines in the shape of a swastika“ could be seen in the office of an Ohio Republican representative. In the same week, Politico exposed a Telegram group chat in which <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/14/private-chat-among-young-gop-club-members-00592146">Young Republican leaders praised Hitler and joked about the Holocaust</a>, and President Donald Trump announced plans for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/21/us/politics/trump-arch-washington-memorial.html">a privately funded “triumphal arch”</a> that looks like an unbuilt Albert Speer design.</p>
<p>Gunn’s recent work has seemed to anticipate recent events, whether it’s <em>Peacemaker</em> season two, which envisions a United States government overrun by Nazis who openly idolize Adolf Hitler, or his recent version of <em>Superman</em>, in which arch-villain Lex Luthor is a hybrid of Elon Musk, Patrick Bateman, and the current president. But Gunn is not a Cassandra of comics adaptations. He’s a storyteller who has a specific take on human nature, knows a bit about history and current events, and has figured out how to make a melodramatic statement without stinting on fight scenes, chases, heel turns, and other elements that superhero fans expect.</p>
