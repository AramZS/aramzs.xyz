<p>In a seemingly unexpected bid to calm the frenzy over <strong><a data-ylk="slk:Bad Bunny;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://theblast.com/tag/bad-bunny/">Bad Bunny</a></strong> headlining the 2026 Super Bowl halftime show, the NFL has introduced a special feature.</p>
<p>Singer <strong>Sting</strong> has been announced as part of a lineup for a pre-Super Bowl concert, set for February 6 at the Palace of Fine Arts in San Francisco, just two days before the big game at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara.</p>
<p>However, given the strong opposition to the NFL’s choice of the Puerto Rican star, the question remains, will this move be enough to silence the critics?</p>
<h2><b>Singer Sting Tapped In For A Performance At A Super Bowl-Branded Show </b></h2>
<figure><img alt="Sting performing at the Seine Musicale in Paris" data-nimg="1" src="https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/.H.lpA25xmO1yIFbRGxYaQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTE0NDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/theblast_73/a2b801323dbff401ef79194147f10b77"/><figcaption>Spread Pictures / MEGA</figcaption></figure>
<p>On October 28, the NFL’s hospitality provider, On Location, confirmed that the “Every Breath You Take” singer would be the main act at a spin-off event, per <a data-ylk="slk:Entertainment Weekly;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://ew.com/sting-will-headline-super-bowl-branded-concert-2-days-before-big-game-11839055">Entertainment Weekly</a>.</p>
<p>According to On Location's website, Sting's show is part of Super Bowl LX Studio 60, an event series designed to deliver an “epic weekend of unforgettable music entertainment at one of San Francisco's most iconic venues.”</p>
<p>While specific details about the concert remain under wraps, tickets start at $750, offering fans a premium experience that includes opportunities to meet both former and current NFL players.</p>
<p>The Studio 60 series will continue for a second night on February 7 at the same venue, though performers for that evening have yet to be announced.</p>

<p>The hiring of Sting for a Super Bowl spin-off concert comes shortly after the football organization reaffirmed its decision to have the "I Like It" collaborator headline the 2026 Halftime Show.</p>
<p>At a press conference last week, as <a data-ylk="slk:The Blast;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" href="https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/music/articles/nfl-confidently-stands-bad-bunny-203026232.html">The Blast</a> reported, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell revealed that their choice was deliberate and acknowledged that criticism of their halftime bookings is nothing new.</p>
<p>Addressing the criticism, he expressed confidence that Bad Bunny would deliver a spectacular performance, which, according to him, would be an “exciting and united moment.”</p>
<h2><b>Critics Go to Extreme Lengths To Make Sure Bad Bunny Won’t Perform On Football’s Biggest Stage </b></h2>
<figure><img alt="George Strait" data-nimg="1" src="https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/x68CTzKA4swvJwh.fJjq_Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTc2ODtjZj13ZWJw/https://media.zenfs.com/en/theblast_73/aae5e3669b89f678167d55d2d72a95eb"/><figcaption>Curtis Hilbun / AFF-USA.com / MEGA</figcaption></figure>
<p>Before Goodell broke his silence on the matter, a petition lodged on Change.org called on the NFL to axe the three-time Grammy winner from the gig.</p>
<p>Per <a data-ylk="slk:The Blast;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" href="https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/music/articles/over-50k-fans-petition-george-191541992.html">The Blast</a>, the petition, which garnered over fifty thousand signatures, cited reasons why Bad Bunny should be removed. It stated that his music style and “drag performances” are not what families should be seeing on the stage.</p>
<p>The petition then demanded that George Strait replace Bad Bunny. According to the letter, Strait is a better pick given his musical style, which resonates with generations and embodies true American music.</p>
<p>Now, although Strait was not hired, it appears the football league may, in fact, be taking the critics' concerns to heart.</p>
<h2><b>What Jay-Z Has To Say Amid The Controversy </b></h2>
<figure><img alt="Jay-Z at Los Angeles Premiere Of Sony Pictures' 'The Book of Clarence'" data-nimg="1" src="https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/OyPm0zrLtqBWCIgIp5u90A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTk2MDtjZj13ZWJw/https://media.zenfs.com/en/theblast_73/c8eba8ee60e9da2c02eea2f86a58ef39"/><figcaption>Xavier Collin/Image Press Agency/MEGA</figcaption></figure>
<p>Alongside the NFL’s defense of Bad Bunny, Jay- Z also recently reacted to the backlash, and in his opinion, it is manufactured.</p>
<p>As <a data-ylk="slk:The Blast;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" href="https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/music/articles/jay-z-five-word-response-214514664.html">The Blast</a> reported, a day ago, when asked in an interview about the hate surrounding Bad Bunny, the rapper responded, “They love him. Don't let them fool you.”</p>
<p>Although the “Forever Young” hitmaker did not say more, his cryptic reply seemingly reinforced his support for Bad Bunny.</p>
<p>Jay-Z, whose company Roc Nation oversees the selection of Super Bowl headliners, had previously praised Bad Bunny when the announcement was made, saying, “We are honored to have him on the world's biggest stage.”</p>
<h2><b>Bad Bunny Blasted for Remaining Seated During National Anthem</b></h2>
<figure><img alt="Bad Bunny at ''Caught Stealing'' New York Premiere" data-nimg="1" src="https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/AI.fNaExXqBqbJVMUg4Tag--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTE0MjE7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/theblast_73/57590430cf2c676b6941ca34b15c36ef"/><figcaption>Nancy Rivera/MEGA</figcaption></figure>
<p>Amid the ongoing backlash, Bad Bunny seems to have ruffled more feathers with his recent actions. Earlier this month, <a data-ylk="slk:The Blast;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" href="https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/music/articles/bad-bunny-sparks-fresh-maga-204518908.html">The Blast</a> reported that the artist appeared to remain seated during the traditional seventh-inning performance of "God Bless America" at a New York Yankees vs. Toronto Blue Jays game.</p>
<p>Photos and videos from the match showed the “Mia” singer sitting with friends behind home plate while most fans around them stood with their hands over their hearts as the crowd sang the patriotic tune.</p>
<p>The moment quickly went viral, prompting MAGA supporters to lash out at the 31-year-old songwriter, accusing him of disrespecting the country.</p>
<p>MAGA political commentator Tomi Lahren slammed the singer on X, writing, "Bad Bunny appears to stay seated during 'God Bless America' at Yankee Stadium... Yeah, because he has a clear disdain for America. He's an -sshole."</p>
