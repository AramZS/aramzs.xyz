<p>Homeland Security asked a judge to deport a man to Afghanistan, where he expects the Taliban to kill him. What happens next could affect thousands.</p>
<p>The U.S. government asked a judge this month to deport a father of two to Afghanistan, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2025/10/14/trump-immigratio-afghanistan-asylum-deportation/">where he expects the Taliban to kill him. </a>To make its case, the Department of Homeland Security did not accuse him of any crime or disloyalty or act of terrorism. Instead, attorneys argued that Afghanistan — a country U.S. forces rescued him from in 2021 — is safe for his return.</p>
