<p>The United States has long been one of the most popular destinations for international students pursuing graduate studies. But pauses to some of the country's <a data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00608-z" data-track="click" data-track-category="body text link" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00608-z">university PhD programmes</a> and the imposition of visa restrictions for students from <a data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01791-9" data-track="click" data-track-category="body text link" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01791-9">certain countries</a> have prompted other nations to try to attract those students who have been affected by the changes or who no longer want to study in the United States.</p>
<p>US President Donald Trump’s administration has proposed <a data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01397-1" data-track="click" data-track-category="body text link" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01397-1">slashing budgets</a> at some of the country’s top scientific agencies and has frozen funds for grants and contracts for universities.</p>
<p>Chris Tisdell, a researcher in education and mathematics at the University of New South Wales (UNSW) in Sydney, Australia, says he has heard reports of international students already shifting away from the US because of uncertainties surrounding funding. International student arrivals dropped by 30% in June this year compared to June 2024, according to data reported by the US International Trade Administration.</p>
<p>Gwilym Croucher, a researcher in higher education at the University of Melbourne, Australia, says he expects talented PhD candidates to look elsewhere. “The beneficiaries of that may be established places like Canada, Australia, the UK, a lot of Europe, but they may also be China and India,” he says.</p>
<p>So which countries have stepped up efforts to woo PhD students? And what are they offering?</p>
<h2>Canada</h2>
<p>Several universities in Canada have set up programmes to attract students from the United States.</p>
<p>In July, Western University in Ontario launched a Doctoral Excellence Award, targeting current and prospective students of US universities, including those who have had an offer rescinded in the past six months, at US universities ranked in the top 100 globally. Initially, 25 PhD students will be supported, receiving a PhD stipend for up to four years of study, as well as “fast-tracked admissions and help finding a supervisor”, says Florentine Strzelczyk, Western University’s provost. PhD stipends increased across Canada, after the government <a data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01124-2" data-track="click" data-track-category="body text link" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01124-2">set </a><a data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01124-2" data-track="click" data-track-category="body text link" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01124-2">a blanket rate</a> of Can$40,000 annually last year.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the University of British Columbia in Vancouver also extended the deadline to allow for late applications from US citizens to be considered for certain graduate programmes starting in January 2026.</p>
<p>Alicia Piazza is in her third year of a PhD at Brock University in Ontario and recommends Canada for graduate studies, particularly because of the quality of training on offer. “I’m three years in and I’m still learning,” she says. The classes she has attended, including one on grant writing and another on presenting and analysing research papers, have prepared her to work in academia or industry. Students at the university are also encouraged to apply for external funding, and she successfully applied for a scholarship from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada.</p>
<p>Piazza receives a stipend from the university that covers her tuition fees, and was also guaranteed a position as a teaching assistant, which helps to cover living expenses, she says. “The rent is not too bad, so it’s pretty affordable,” she adds.</p>
<h2>Europe</h2>
<p>France, Germany and Spain are among other countries that have introduced new programmes to attract students, particularly those from the United States, alongside initiatives to attract scientists further on in their careers.</p>
<p>The University of Paris-Saclay in Orsay, France, is offering eight spots for students to pursue a PhD in subjects spanning climate and environmental science, global health, humanities, social sciences and energy transition. Students who have already started a PhD in the United States are also eligible. International students can apply for several scholarships that cover accommodation and living costs, and in some cases health insurance. Students supported by funding from their university, institution or the national research agency receive between €16,800 (US$19,400) and €18,000 per year.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Max Planck Society in Germany has launched a Transatlantic Program and encouraged prospective students to apply to programmes at its international research schools and graduate centres. Doctoral students are under contract with the society, with set working hours of 39 hours per week and a minimum pay of €32,400 per year.</p>
