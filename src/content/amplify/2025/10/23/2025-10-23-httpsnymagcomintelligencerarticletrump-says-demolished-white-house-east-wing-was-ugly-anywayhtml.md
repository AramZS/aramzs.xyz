  “The East Wing was not much,” Trump argued, so it shouldn’t “hurt a very
  expensive, beautiful building” like his ballroom.

title: Trump Says Demolished White House East Wing Was Ugly Anyway

<p>Incredibly, White House communications director Steven Cheung’s <a href="https://x.com/StevenCheung47/status/1980406883690389560?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">mocking</a> of the “pearl clutching” “losers” who raised concerns about the <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trump-white-house-ballroom-demolition-watch.html">East Wing being demolished</a> did not quell the outrage over President Trump’s unilaterally decision to <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trump-demolishes-white-house-east-wing-for-his-ballroom.html">tear down part of the White House</a> to make way for his ballroom.</p>
<p>So the White House tried a different tactic on Wednesday afternoon: having <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trump-dumps-a-barrage-of-trolling-no-kings-protest-responses.html">President Trump</a> explain that everyone needs to chill out because the East Wing was pretty ugly and his new <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trump-white-house-ballroom-demolition-watch.html">White House ballroom</a> will be totally badass.</p>
<p>“You know, the East Wing was not much,” Trump mused before the press in the Oval Office. “It was not much left from the original. It was, over the course of 100 years, it was changed, the columns were removed, it was a much different building. Then a story was added on in 1948, 1949. There was a story added on which was not particularly nice. And the building was very, very much changed from what it was originally. It was never thought of as being much. It was a very small building.”</p>
<p>So, Trump asserted, it would be wrong to let this historic eyesore stand in the way of his grand ballroom vision. “Rather than allowing that to hurt a very expensive, beautiful building that frankly they’ve been after for years,” he said.</p>

<p>While he was speaking, Trump brandished what appeared to be unreleased blueprints for the ballroom project, which have yet to be submitted to the National Capital Planning Commission, as (<a href="https://www.milwaukeeindependent.com/newswire/construction-crews-demolish-part-white-house-without-approval-build-trumps-royal-ballroom/">arguably</a>) required by law.</p>
<p>He also revealed that the military is involved in the ballroom construction … because they just love making beautiful buildings?</p>
<p>“We’re also working with the military on it, ’cause they want to make sure it’s perfect, and the military is very much involved in this,” Trump said. “They want to make sure that everything is absolutely beautiful.”</p>
<p>Wow! <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@cbsnews/video/6874268714213117189">You’re telling me now for the first time</a>!</p>
<p>And while Trump said in July that the project “Won’t interfere with the current building,” he appeared to confirm that the entire East Wing will soon be no more.</p>
<p>“We are using little sections of footings and various other things, but that’s sort of irrelevant,” he said. “In order to do it properly we had to take down the existing structure.</p>
<p>Earlier today a White House officials <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/trump-administration-demolishing-entire-east-wing-white-house-add-new-rcna239018">told</a> NBC News that the “entirety” of the East Wing would go, but it would eventually be “modernized and rebuilt.” Trump’s model showed the new ballroom dwarfing the rest of the White House complex, but it’s unclear where this modernized East Wing might go (the giant structure on the right is the Treasury Building).</p>

<p>Trump certainly made some interesting arguments, but we still have a lot of questions. It probably would have been good if he made this pitch before most of the East Wing was in rubble.</p>
