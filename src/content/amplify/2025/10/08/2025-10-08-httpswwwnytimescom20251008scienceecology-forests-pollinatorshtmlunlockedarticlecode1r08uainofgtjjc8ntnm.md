<p>Lost Science</p>
<p>Kim Ballare was a research ecologist with the U.S. Forest Service until her federal grant “got snatched away.”</p>
<p><strong>Lost Science</strong> is an ongoing series of accounts from scientists who have lost their jobs or funding after cuts by the Trump administration. The conversations have been edited for clarity and length. Here’s why we’re doing this.</p>
<p><strong>Kim Ballare:</strong> In graduate school, I fell in love with bees and other pollinators. They’re so important to our functioning ecosystem, but they’re really unknown to a lot of people. Most people just think about the European honeybee, which is not a native species in the United States. But there are 4,000 species of bees in the United States, and their diversity and their different functions are fascinating. My main species focus during my Ph.D. was on the Eastern Carpenter bee, which is huge — bigger than a bumblebee — and make their nests by chewing into wood with their little jaws.</p>
<p>In 2023, when I got a job with the Forest Service, I was leading a project in Montana looking at how forest management techniques affect pollinators — specifically, logging and prescribed burning. It was my first major grant. We bought a lot of equipment and planned to support a Ph.D. student. The site is a beautiful forest with mainly lodgepole pine and spruce and Douglas fir, with some open areas that are just full of wildflowers like lupines and geraniums and balsam root, which looks like a big sunflower.</p>
