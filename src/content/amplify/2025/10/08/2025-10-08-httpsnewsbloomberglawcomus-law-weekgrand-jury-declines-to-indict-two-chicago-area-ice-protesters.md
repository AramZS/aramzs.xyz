<p>A federal grand jury declined to indict two people charged with assaulting law enforcement agents outside a suburban Chicago ICE facility, an attorney for one of the defendants said.</p>
<p>The rejection of charges by a grand jury, once extremely unusual, is growing more common in cities targeted by President Donald Trump with immigration raids, military deployments, and other federal resources to crack down on crime.</p>
<p>Prosecutors’ inability to secure this indictment continues a pattern mirrored in Los Angeles and Washington DC where local citizens on grand juries are providing a check on a White House-directed law enforcement takeover.</p>
<p>The development is a setback for the Trump administration’s surge into Chicago, with National Guard troops and senior DOJ leaders arriving Tuesday.</p>
<p>Ray Collins and Jocelyne Robledo were charged in late September with assaulting and impeding federal officers during a protest by the front entrance of an immigration facility. Defense attorneys were told Tuesday that the grand jury didn’t return a true bill of indictment, according to Richard Kling, who represents Collins.</p>
<p>It’s extremely rare for grand juries not to return indictments. Grand jurors don’t hear defense arguments and prosecutors are asked to meet a much lower standard of proof—probable cause—than when proving a defendant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt at trial.</p>
<p>Kling said prosecutors aren’t expected to proceed with the case.</p>
<p>An attorney for Robledo didn’t immediately return a request for comment. A spokesman for the US Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Illinois also didn’t immediately respond. A DOJ spokesperson in Washington declined to comment.</p>
<p>Robledo and Collins were charged under the same statute that Attorney General Pam Bondi has directed federal prosecutors to utilize nationwide.</p>
<p>Bondi ordered US attorney’s offices in a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/ag/media/1415691/dl?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery">Sept. 29 memo</a> to bring this charge against “any individual who assaults or forcibly impedes or intimidates” law enforcement officers protecting ICE facilities.</p>
<p>Andrew Boutros, the US attorney in Chicago, said Oct. 4 that the city’s prosecutors “will not hesitate to hold accountable those who attack and undermine the rule of law, including by resorting to violence and criminal mischief to interfere, obstruct, or impede the important work of the federal government as it is conducted in the Northern District of Illinois.”</p>
<p>Collins and Robledo were in a crowd of protesters Sept. 27 at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Broadview, Ill., a location that has been the site of repeated demonstrations as federal immigration enforcement has escalated in the Chicago area.</p>
<p>In an affidavit, authorities alleged Robledo “pushed back” agents who were trying to push back the crowd, and agents detained her after seeing a gun at her waist. Collins, who saw the struggle, charged forward yelling at agents to get away from his wife, and the thumb of an agent with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives was injured in the scuffle with Collins, according to the affidavit.</p>
<p>Kling, in an interview, said Collins was coming to his partner’s aid after agents grabbed her and threw her against a wall. Both defendants were legally carrying guns but didn’t use or brandish them, Kling said.</p>
<p>Kling said it was notable that the grand jury likely had members on both sides of the political divide and still decided not to indict.</p>
<p>“You know the old saying that a good prosecutor could have a grand jury indict a ham sandwich?” Kling said. “Apparently the evidence against my client was less than a ham sandwich.”</p>
<p>Also Tuesday, prosecutors <a href="https://www.bloomberglaw.com/public/document/USAvMazurDocketNo125cr00607NDIllSep282025CourtDocket?doc_id=X4OC933HEHB94N9AEIM2KR0J6PA">moved to dismiss charges</a> against Hubert Mazur, who was charged in connection with a Broadview protest the same day as Collins and Robledo.</p>
<p>Grand juries also pushed back in Los Angeles this year when the temporary US attorney ordered his office to pursue indictments in protest-related cases despite being advised by his prosecutors that there was insufficient evidence, <a data-terminal-id="T06HWDGPWCG8" href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/trumps-la-prosecutor-orders-cases-his-staff-say-lack-evidence">Bloomberg Law reported</a>.</p>
<p>The New York Times and other media outlets have also reported that Washington, DC grand juries failed to return indictments against multiple individuals charged with federal felony counts after the Trump administration ordered street sweeps and mass arrests.</p>
<p>That included the grand jury’s refusal to indict a former Justice Department employee accused of <a data-terminal-id="T1QBL0GPWCJN" href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/white-collar-and-criminal-law/federal-charge-against-sandwich-hurler-downgraded-to-misdemeanor">throwing a sandwich</a> at a Customs and Border Protection officer.</p>
