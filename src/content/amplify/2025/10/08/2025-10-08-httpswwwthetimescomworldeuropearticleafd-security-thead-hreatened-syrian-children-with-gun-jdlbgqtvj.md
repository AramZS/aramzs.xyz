<p>The radical right-wing Alternative for Germany (AfD) party has fired its head of parliamentary security after it was discovered that he had been convicted of menacing two Syrian children with a gun.</p>
<p>Philipp Roensch, 38, was fined €9,000 by a court in the southwestern city of Ravensburg last year for threatening behaviour, drink-driving and possession of prohibited items including a cosh, a knuckle duster and pepper spray.</p>
<p>Prosecutors told the trial that in 2022 he had racially abused two Syrians, aged 11 and 16, at a refugee centre in Friedrichshafen, a town on the shore of Lake Constance. They also said he had shot a blank-firing pistol into the air during the altercation.</p>

<p>He was then stopped by police as he drove away and found to be more than three times over the legal blood-alcohol limit.</p>
<p>Officers investigating the incident examined Roensch’s mobile phone and discovered that he was involved in a chat group full of Nazi references, the court found.</p>
<p>The forum’s name, 1888, was interpreted as alphanumeric code for “Adolf Hitler, Heil Hitler” as A and H are the first and eighth letters of the alphabet.</p>
<p>Roensch was convicted by the district court in Tettnang several months after the incident. The verdict was largely confirmed on appeal by the regional court in Ravensburg.</p>
<p>The episode is awkward for <a href="https://www.thetimes.com/world/europe/article/alice-weidel-afd-germany-election-switzerland-wife-sarah-bossard-wgm7r8vcd">Alice Weidel</a>, the AfD’s joint leader and national figurehead, because Roensch is still listed as a committee member of her local constituency association in Lake Constance and the chairman of one of its district branches.</p>

<p>He continued working for the AfD’s parliamentary group until Der Spiegel broke the news of his conviction last month.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the group confirmed that Roensch no longer worked there. He was one of three staff members whose parliamentary passes were revoked by the Bundestag administration after the publication of the Spiegel report, according to Taz, a left-leaning German newspaper.</p>
