title: Warner Bros. Discovery puts itself up for sale
---
<p>Warner Bros. Discovery, the owner of HBO, CNN, and other cable networks, said on Tuesday that it is putting itself up for sale.</p>
<p>In a press release, the company announced a "review of potential alternatives," Wall Street speak for a sale. WBD said it had recently received "unsolicited interest" from "multiple parties for both the entire company and Warner Bros."</p>
<p>The company said that while it shops itself around, it will continue to work on <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/media/warner-bros-discovery-split-cnn-tnt-hbo-streaming-service-studios-rcna211776">the previously announced split of its cable networks</a> from its streaming and studio business.</p>
<p>Any deal for part of all of the company would be a sizable one. As of Monday's close of trading, Warner Bros. Discovery had a market value of more than $45 billion. It also carries billions of dollars of debt on its balance sheet.</p>
<p>In September, Paramount Global <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/media/paramount-skydance-prepares-blockbuster-bid-warner-bros-discovery-rcna230670">was preparing a bid</a> for all of WBD, however it appeared to stall in recent weeks.</p>
