<p>A lot of people seem to think “the problem is the goddamn phones” and the answer is to do something like what Jonathan Haidt, <a href="https://www.thefp.com/p/exciting-news-jonathan-haidt-joins-the-free-press">The Free Press contributor</a> and author of the bestseller <em>The Anxious Generation,</em> tells us to do: take action to restrict who logs onto the internet and what they can do there.</p>
<p>In this post I want to make the case for why this line of thinking, when you follow it past first impressions and start considering what it would mean for people, is dangerous. The phone ban movement has influenced policy in countries around the world. Australia, the United Kingdom, and many states within the USA have enacted restrictions on the way children use the internet, and Haidt has earned himself a perch from which to pontificate on all manner of issues, encouraging those at the center of the political spectrum into an increasingly disciplinarian and reactionary frame of mind.</p>
<p>1.</p>
<p>First, the most proximate and practical reason why it’s a bad idea to ban phones or age-limit social media: The political context any such ban would enter into is far too dangerous. The internet is today’s public square. Under conditions of authoritarian consolidation like we’re seeing in many liberal democracies, making moves to limit who can access the public square and what they can do on it cedes ground we can’t afford to lose. It is naive to think these laws will stop at Haidt’s reasonable-sounding suggestions or be interpreted responsibly by courts and school boards stocked with people who support authoritarianism.</p>
<p>To engage in some rank (but fairly obvious) punditry, it’s also foolish to think any kind of limitation on the internet is a winning proposition with voters, as seen in the very negative public response to the TikTok ban in the US, and to age-verification laws in the UK. Add to that the haphazard and incompetent implementation of both these policies. I think it’s very reasonable to argue that, in last year’s close election, the Biden administration’s approval of a TikTok ban swayed voters and added to an overall impression of Democrats being out of touch with the ways most people live.</p>
<p>The only framework in which restricting social media is a good move politically is one where you expect to no longer care about elections. If your goal is to accumulate power through anti-democratic means, control narratives, and run conversations then a clear next step in authoritarian consolidation is to take control of social media. X and Truth Social are essentially already theirs. TikTok will, if all goes according to plan, belong to aligned billionaires soon. Instagram and Facebook belong to Zuck, who seems to be on board, kind of. YouTube just <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/2025/10/youtube-trump-settlement/684431/">bought Trump the ballroom he's been wanting for so long.</a></p>
<p>Why add a legal arrow to the quiver of a government that already is acting to control the internet and what we see on it through the use of targeted economic and political pressure?</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong></p>
<p>If you take Haidt’s premise that phones and social media are hurting children as true, then you should question whether the right policy remedy is an intervention in the way teachers run their classrooms and what children are allowed to see and do online.</p>

<p>Why not fine the companies for endangering kids or create new rules they have to follow? Why not introduce competition into a monopolized market space, so that parents and kids have more choice in how to spend their time online? Why not put consumer safety standards on the algorithms, the software, the devices themselves?</p>
<p>Why is the preferred tool to save a generation from anguish and our democracy from decline a patchwork of laws governing the decisions consumers can make, instead of a strategy to hold bad actors and industry to account?</p>
<p>Can you really solve a structural problem — the fracking of attention spans by massive companies, the monopolization of media and culture by privately-owned platforms, the decline of IRL venues for civic life — with a series of cosmetic fixes that conveniently fit what administrators already know how to do, and reassure people that everything can be fixed if folks just started following the right rules?</p>
<p>The whole “ban social media” argument concedes (or rather takes for granted) that “social media” must continue to exist in the form it currently takes. Rather than thinking about what these things really <em>are</em> or mean, the would-be phone-banners seek to run away from the question and retreat to the fantasy of a social order that people like Haidt would like to see — a Neverland where “free range” childhood looks like a Norman Rockwell painting and everyone listens to “experts.”</p>
<p>At the risk of turning into <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/that-one-friend-thats-too-woke">“that woke friend,”</a> isn’t this kind of a <em>carceral framework? </em>There is a long American tradition of turning systemic problems into moralized individual issues. Everything is about personal responsibility, individual people making bad choices to which the state must respond accordingly. People are poor because they don’t work hard enough, they do crime because they are evil, shooters do violence because they’re playing too many video games. The sources of these issues, in this frame of thinking, go no deeper than that. Are we to have a war on phones, just as we had a war on drugs?</p>
<p>3.</p>
<p>Haidt’s thesis is broader than just “new thing bad.” He thinks “new thing is everything,” which is also wrong. In <em>The Anxious Generation </em>and his public commentary since then, you find a dismissal of young people as a thinking, feeling group: they are anxious because of phones, they empathize with Gaza because of phones, they vote for Trump because of phones.</p>
<p>The intention is not to belittle young people, although it’s clear Haidt has minimal respect for them. Rather, the monocausal explanation of “it’s because technology” is emotionally appealing because it is a permission structure for denial. To say it is just technology is to avoid confronting inequality, injustice, and the destruction of our planet. It reduces humans to their behavior, swaps what should be a political question for a technocratic one. It is a fantasy of a world where problems are not political or ethical but psychological, and where people are not complex agents, but victims, dupes, or perpetrators.</p>
<p>Haidt side-steps the broader conversations we need to have about our world, and does so because the questions such an investigation would dredge up — about how we treat each other, whether the system is fair, and if the way we live today is actually sustainable or morally defensible — are far too uncomfortable. A lot of people understandably feel the same discomfort, which is the reason why there’s always a market for thinkers like him. If the children are sad because the phones are bad, not because their entire world is fucked, then there’s something we can do about it while still operating by the rule book that is legible to us. A more pragmatic approach — which would probably be more radical — is disqualified, and we can continue pretending it’s the twentieth century still.</p>
<p>The danger of this dodge is it leaves the harder job to our kids. Reactionary lines of argument like Haidt’s abdicate the responsibility of reimagining the social orders that structure the way we live, die, and use one another. They evade the deeper responsibility of empathy and reason, preferring instead the applause line of saying “TikTok dances are bad” to an auditorium full of fifty-year-olds who already agree with you. That is the tactic of a weak man who will create hard times.</p>

<p>In my piece about slop capitalism, I wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>The phone ushered us (Generation Z) into the adult world and seemed to develop at the same pace we did, becoming more complex, problematic, and capable at the same rate as we and our friends.</p></blockquote>
<p>We grew up alongside the memes, apps, and platforms which now <em>are</em> the world. And we can’t escape that world. We post about going offline and touching grass and then watch as the likes and shares arrive, festooning the little clickable bell with bright numbers. It <em>is </em>the world now, and the only real way out, to a better future, is through. That doesn’t mean we’re uncritical or parents shouldn’t do anything to limit the time a child spends on a screen — it’s just that we recognize the screen as a vital space for kids to learn how to live across, and understand that there is no other world than this one.</p>

<p>Now, a note on Jonathan Haidt himself.</p>
<p>One could dismiss Haidt by saying old people will always try and legislate against what young people love to do. His rhetoric participates in a long tradition of criticizing mass youth culture, frequently backed up with a form of pseudoscientific language: he talks about TikTok the way people used to talk about Call of Duty, rap music, rock and roll, girls in blue jeans, the talkies, and paintings that were not of people from Ancient Rome.</p>
<p>One should not expect much more from a man whose primary academic contribution before the anti-phone crusade was Moral Foundations Theory, which is essentially a Dungeons &amp; Dragons alignment chart for Bush-era culture wars. What do “Purity” or “Fairness” really mean, and what do people think they mean when you poll them about it? Who knows really, but if you can put a bad idea on a chart, it will look like science and it will seem to say something perceptive about people while actually saying nothing that would rock the boat. And then it gets you the grant you applied for.</p>

<p>There is no historical dimension to Haidt’s work, no sense of how a concept like “Fairness” or “Conservative” developed, other than the conjecture that these things are somehow rooted in biology, brain chemistry. In Haidt’s telling, it is as if we have leaped from living in caves directly into modern civilization, untouched by all the world in between. The categories and cliches we lived within back in 1997 are declared eternal and self-justifying rather than contingent. The hunches, habits, and feelings of other people are put in an Excel spreadsheet to be labelled, while the scientist himself observes it all from an Archimedean point outside the partisan fray, having transcended emotion simply by taking it into account.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thefp.com/p/why-the-mental-health-of-liberal">Girls on the left have worse mental health than other groups,</a> Haidt says. And this has been the bedrock of his analysis of phones, but also his analysis of activism on left-leaning college campuses. But what does “left” mean, and what does “mental health” mean? A recent paper dives into the topic:</p>

<p>This is a broader issue with much social science and polling today: words do not point to things clearly, directly, or uniformly. People themselves are not coherent data. And there is little interest, among people like Haidt, in considering language itself, the substance in which social life lives, as an object of study — nor is there an interest in looking at history.</p>
<p>What, after all, is “anxiety” at the end of the day? At the risk of sounding too post-structuralist, is the DSM-V not a <em>text? </em>Does it not have its own history, series of revisions, and involvement in an institutional order where it doesn’t just <em>describe</em> the suffering people go through, but <em>classifies </em>it so insurance companies can bill accordingly and doctors can prescribe? And, on top of that, does “anxiety” not have an intricate cultural history which may determine whether a young liberal woman is more or less comfortable with identifying herself as anxious than a young conservative man? One could, at the risk of rocking the boat too much, make these same arguments about terms like “conservative” or “liberal” (first recorded use of that word is 1815) or even… dare we say it… “man” and “woman.” Aren’t all of these terms we live by fundamentally <em>contested?</em> But you can’t just endlessly do Foucault to everything either.</p>
<p>I used to be more open to Haidt, but in the course of reporting on internet culture I came to know social scientists who study the internet. Nearly every single social scientist I have ever spoken to has told me they think Haidt is an idiot, that he has spent his career <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00902-2">spinning data to fit his preconceived notions,</a> and the profession laughs at him. The people who take Haidt seriously are not the people who study in his field, but the people who agree with him politically and culturally.</p>
<p>And my real problem with Haidt is that I fear he would gladly sign on as an RFK Jr. type figure, happy to prosecute his particular crusade against modernity and feeling valuable, listened-to, powerful while doing it. Some people care more about being right than about living in a republic, and there are too many people like that at the commanding heights of American media and institutions today.</p>
