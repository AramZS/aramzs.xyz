There are roughly 26,000 worldwide, with about 3,000 thought to be in Greenland. (Bonnie Jo Mount/The Washington Post)</figcaption></figure><p>The Trump administration is considering whether to spend up to $50 million in foreign aid to protect polar bears in Greenland and $25 million for snow leopards in Nepal, proposals strikingly at odds with a parallel initiative to slash humanitarian and wildlife programs deemed incompatible with President Donald Trump’s “America First” agenda, according to documents reviewed by The Washington Post and people familiar with the matter.</p><p class="rw-outer-content"><span>Some content could not be imported from the original document.</span> <a href="https://washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/10/09/trump-greenland-polar-bears/">View content ↗ </a></p><p>As of mid-September, the State Department was actively assembling teams to devise the funding proposals, internal emails show. The move, which has not been previously reported or publicly announced, stunned diplomats and elected officials from the United States and other nations, as well as scientific researchers who work on conservation efforts for the animals involved, many of whom noted the administration’s dramatic cuts to other U.S. foreign assistance.</p><p class="rw-outer-content"><span>Some content could not be imported from the original document.</span> <a href="https://washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/10/09/trump-greenland-polar-bears/">View content ↗ </a></p><p class="rw-outer-content"><span>Some content could not be imported from the original document.</span> <a href="https://washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/10/09/trump-greenland-polar-bears/">View content ↗ </a></p><p>The Greenland initiative is particularly noteworthy, as Trump — citing the Arctic island’s strategic location and rich natural resources — has repeatedly expressed a desire to acquire the semiautonomous territory through purchase or annexation. Greenland remains part of the Danish realm, and its people have expressed little interest in Trump’s solicitations.</p><p class="rw-outer-content"><span>Some content could not be imported from the original document.</span> <a href="https://washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/10/09/trump-greenland-polar-bears/">View content ↗ </a></p><p>In a statement acknowledging the conversations that are underway, the State Department said that biodiversity funding was being considered only because it was mandated by Congress before Trump returned to the White House.</p><p class="rw-outer-content"><span>Some content could not be imported from the original document.</span> <a href="https://washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/10/09/trump-greenland-polar-bears/">View content ↗ </a></p><p>“This is very hard to justify as in America’s national interest, but because the State Department is complying with applicable laws and unable to reprogram the FY2024 funding, we are exploring creative ways to abide by the law and still advance our country’s strategic goals,” the statement said, using an abbreviation for the previous fiscal year.</p><p>One aim, the statement continued, was to identify “opportunities to strengthen economic and diplomatic ties with key partners” and advance Trump’s foreign policy goals “even while forced to meet this congressionally mandated earmark.”</p><p class="rw-outer-content"><span>Some content could not be imported from the original document.</span> <a href="https://washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/10/09/trump-greenland-polar-bears/">View content ↗ </a></p><p>The Trump administration previously has flouted lawmakers’ intent on federal spending. In August, for instance, the Office of Management and Budget <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/08/29/trump-cancels-international-aid/" target="_blank">nixed almost $5 billion in foreign aid already signed into law</a>, a move the Senate Appropriations Committee’s top Republican, Sen. Susan Collins (Maine), called “a clear violation of the law.”</p><p class="rw-outer-content"><span>Some content could not be imported from the original document.</span> <a href="https://washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/10/09/trump-greenland-polar-bears/">View content ↗ </a></p><p>Researchers who work on polar bear conservation in Greenland expressed bewilderment over the scale of the funding proposal under consideration, calling it many orders of magnitude greater than their current funding and saying the figure was so vast that it was unclear if it could all be spent. These people, like several others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the Trump administration’s calculations.</p><p>The Trump administration paused most foreign aid after entering office and later made sweeping cuts to programs that, among other things, provided tens of millions of dollars’ worth of <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/06/29/sudan-usaid-funding-cuts-trump-musk/" target="_blank">medicine</a> for people in war-torn Sudan and for food aid in crisis areas such as <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/08/02/usaid-expired-food-supplies-malnutrition/" target="_blank">Gaza</a>.</p><p class="rw-outer-content"><span>Some content could not be imported from the original document.</span> <a href="https://washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/10/09/trump-greenland-polar-bears/">View content ↗ </a></p><p>The animal-protection proposals would be funded by the nearly $2 billion once administered by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), which the Trump administration dismantled earlier this year. Trump officials <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/09/24/trump-usaid-funding/" target="_blank">signaled to Congress last month</a> that they planned to shift that lump sum to what in many cases are vaguely defined projects intended to advance the president’s “America First” agenda.</p><p class="rw-outer-content"><span>Some content could not be imported from the original document.</span> <a href="https://washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/10/09/trump-greenland-polar-bears/">View content ↗ </a></p><p class="rw-outer-content"><span>Some content could not be imported from the original document.</span> <a href="https://washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/10/09/trump-greenland-polar-bears/">View content ↗ </a></p><p>Included among the other new uses for that money, as outlined in a September message from the administration to Congress, are initiatives aimed at countering “Marxist, anti-American regimes” in Latin America, and helping maintain peace between Azerbaijan and Armenia in Central Asia. The congressional notice mentions that some funds will be going to Greenland for “economic development and conservation work” and also mentions Nepal as a recipient of aid. The document does not describe how much would go to those countries or how it would be spent.</p><p>Congressional aides who have been briefed on the $2 billion reallocation told The Post that they had sought explanation from the administration given Trump’s vow to annex Greenland. When informed of the biodiversity proposals being devised, some said they were incredulous to learn the polar bear and snow leopard projects could receive so much money when others, intended to address human suffering, had been defunded.</p><p class="rw-outer-content"><span>Some content could not be imported from the original document.</span> <a href="https://washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/10/09/trump-greenland-polar-bears/">View content ↗ </a></p><p>“After decimating USAID and State Department programs that Congress authorized and funded, the Trump administration doesn’t get kudos for continuing a sliver of international conservation aid,” Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (New Hampshire), the Senate Foreign Relations Committee’s top Democrat said in a statement,<b> </b>adding that she expected “meaningful congressional consultation and oversight when the administration wants to spend American taxpayer dollars.”</p><p class="rw-outer-content"><span>Some content could not be imported from the original document.</span> <a href="https://washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/10/09/trump-greenland-polar-bears/">View content ↗ </a></p><p>The governments of Denmark, Greenland and Nepal did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p>If carried out, the biodiversity funding proposals could dramatically alter such conservation efforts. The Greenland Institute of Natural Resources, a body that tracks the island’s wildlife, has an annual budget of less than $500,000 for polar bear research. Most of that money comes from the Danish government, according <a href="https://natur.gl/om-os/aarsberetninger/" target="_blank">to annual reports</a>.</p><p class="rw-outer-content"><span>Some content could not be imported from the original document.</span> <a href="https://washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/10/09/trump-greenland-polar-bears/">View content ↗ </a></p><p>Several State Department staffers said they, too, were shocked to learn the Trump administration wanted to spend money to protect endangered animals, given its recent record on wildlife conservation. In April, for example, the government proposed redefining what it means to “harm” animals under the Endangered Species Act, a move environmentalists <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2025/04/10/trump-endangered-species-protections-dire-wolves/" target="_blank">warn</a> will lead to greater habitat destruction.</p><p>Polar bears and snow leopards both are listed as a vulnerable species by <a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/species/directory?direction=desc&amp;page=2&amp;sort=extinction_status" target="_blank">the World Wildlife Fund</a>, because of various threats including climate change and the wildlife trade. There are roughly 26,000 polar bears worldwide, with about 3,000 thought to be in Greenland. The planet has at least 4,000 snow leopards, <a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/stories/in-nepal-new-snow-leopard-numbers-show-stable-population" target="_blank">with fewer than 400 living in Nepal</a>.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KD2HUPSFRAI6ZPWKHTDRAO6YCQ.jpg"/><figcaption>A snow leopard in its enclosure at Central Park Zoo in New York City. (Cindy Ord/Getty Images)</figcaption></figure><p>One State Department employee familiar with the polar bear project said that, internally, it has raised questions because spending on so much else has been slashed. This person said that he and his colleagues estimated it would translate to about $100,000 per polar bear.</p><p class="rw-outer-content"><span>Some content could not be imported from the original document.</span> <a href="https://washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/10/09/trump-greenland-polar-bears/">View content ↗ </a></p><p>“It’s something [the Office of Foreign Assistance] has been pushing for months,” the employee said. “While everything else is eliminated.” Another State Department staffer was more blunt, saying: “We are doing absolutely nothing right now to protect any nature or wildlife.”</p><p class="rw-outer-content"><span>Some content could not be imported from the original document.</span> <a href="https://washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/10/09/trump-greenland-polar-bears/">View content ↗ </a></p><p class="rw-outer-content"><span>Some content could not be imported from the original document.</span> <a href="https://washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/10/09/trump-greenland-polar-bears/">View content ↗ </a></p><p>Other employees noted that the agency’s arm that would normally handle distributing such funds, the Bureau of Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs, was hit hard by Trump initiatives to shrink the federal workforce. Through firings, retirements and resignations, that bureau has seen several offices close, most of its senior leadership depart and roughly half of its staff leave, two employees said.</p><p>The emails reviewed by The Post say that the funding is a priority for Jeremy Lewin, a political appointee performing the duties of undersecretary for foreign assistance, humanitarian affairs and religious freedom. Lewin, who had not worked in government before joining the Trump administration as a member of Elon Musk’s U.S. DOGE Service this year, has emerged as a key implementer of administration policies, including the dismantling of USAID and the reorganization of the State Department.</p><p class="rw-outer-content"><span>Some content could not be imported from the original document.</span> <a href="https://washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/10/09/trump-greenland-polar-bears/">View content ↗ </a></p><p>The focus on Greenland and Nepal — a country nestled between superpowers India and China<b> </b>that has <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/09/09/nepal-social-media-protests-prime-minister-resigns/">recently seen a bloody period of political unrest</a> — has led to some alarm among observers.</p><p>Trump has suggested that he would consider using military force to take Greenland if the territory is not sold to the United States. Earlier this year, according <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/04/01/trump-greenland-us-territory-cost/" target="_blank">to previous Post reporting</a>, the White House prepared estimates for how much it would cost to maintain Greenland as a territory, suggesting that the president’s public statements were more than just musings.</p><p class="rw-outer-content"><span>Some content could not be imported from the original document.</span> <a href="https://washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/10/09/trump-greenland-polar-bears/">View content ↗ </a></p><p>In August, Denmark’s foreign minister summoned a top U.S. diplomat after reports that Americans with suspected ties to Trump had been<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/08/27/greenland-denmark-trump-diplomat/" target="_blank"> carrying out covert influence operations</a> in Greenland. Though Trump has spoken less frequently about Greenland in recent months, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen told lawmakers this week that they should not “breathe a sigh of relief.”</p><p class="rw-outer-content"><span>Some content could not be imported from the original document.</span> <a href="https://washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/10/09/trump-greenland-polar-bears/">View content ↗ </a></p><p>During the first Trump administration, the president expressed similar ambitions regarding Greenland. When those overtures<b> </b>were rebuffed, his administration announced $10 million in USAID funding that was designed for development of key sectors, including mining and tourism.</p><p>While Greenland, due to its relationship with Denmark, has not been a major recipient of American foreign aid in the past, Nepal is a developing nation and had previously received numerous grants from USAID and other U.S. institutions, including <a href="https://2017-2021.state.gov/cool-cats-celebrating-snow-leopard-conservation/">some specifically for snow leopards</a>.</p><blockquote><h2>Correction</h2><p>A previous version of this story and a photo caption referred incorrectly to the World Wildlife Fund as the World Wildlife Foundation. </p></blockquote></body></html>
