<em>TERMS OF SERVICE</em> – a performance by <strong>SHAWNÉ MICHAELAIN HOLLOWAY </strong>with <strong>A.J. McClenon</strong></p>
<p><em>TERMS OF SERVICE</em> is catalyzed by technology, primarily hardware and software-based triggers engaged through the physical collision of Holloway and McClenon’s bodies, in turn producing stunning outputs of sound and light.</p>
<p>The performance is an experiment in the “photography of yearning”—invoking the flare of a photographic flash—in an attempt to triangulate the impossibility of the satisfaction of consummation. Within this performance, “consummation,” what Anne Carson suggests is a basic erotic driver between two bodies, is interrupted by the edges of the performers’ bodies and their illumination during the moment of impact. The sound triggered by the work’s choreography of relentless and repetitive cycles of embracing, disengagement, re-engagement, and retreat, suggests a parallel sequence happening in, around, and through American life as told by the American media.</p>
<p>Holloway provokes us to wonder how large institutional structures turn bodies into tools. Particularly, in the context of this weekend of conversations around sex and technology: How do structures of power and control produce and guarantee a lack of consummation, a lack of satisfaction? What are the erotics of machines, of endless yearning, and who are those performing the instrumentalization?</p>
