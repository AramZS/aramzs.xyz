<p><strong>Why it matters: </strong>Dominion is one of the biggest election equipment providers and was used by <a data-vars-click-url="https://www.factcheck.org/2024/10/dominion-voting-systems-will-operate-in-florida-contrary-to-online-claims/" data-vars-content-id="cae90de6-efda-49b6-a6b3-9cda6cc2162d" data-vars-event-category="story" data-vars-headline="Scoop: Dominion Voting sold to company run by ex-GOP election official" data-vars-item="in_content_link" data-vars-link-text="27 states" data-vars-sub-category="story" href="https://www.factcheck.org/2024/10/dominion-voting-systems-will-operate-in-florida-contrary-to-online-claims/">27 states</a> during the 2024 election.</p>
<p><strong>Zoom in: </strong>Liberty Vote purchased Canada-based Dominion for an undisclosed sum, according to a person familiar with the transaction.</p>
<ul><li>Liberty is owned by Scott Leiendecker, who in 2011 created a software program focused on enabling election workers to verify voters and check them in at polling locations.</li><li>According to Leiendecker's <a data-vars-click-url="https://www.linkedin.com/in/scott-l-5680094/" data-vars-content-id="cae90de6-efda-49b6-a6b3-9cda6cc2162d" data-vars-event-category="story" data-vars-headline="Scoop: Dominion Voting sold to company run by ex-GOP election official" data-vars-item="in_content_link" data-vars-link-text="LinkedIn" data-vars-sub-category="story" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/scott-l-5680094/">LinkedIn</a> page, his company (which has been called KNOWiNK but is changing its name to Liberty Vote) has more than 150 employees and $55 million in annual revenue. </li><li>The company says its systems are used by election officials in more than a third of U.S. states and describes itself as the "nation's leading provider of <a data-vars-click-url="https://www.ncsl.org/elections-and-campaigns/electronic-poll-books" data-vars-content-id="cae90de6-efda-49b6-a6b3-9cda6cc2162d" data-vars-event-category="story" data-vars-headline="Scoop: Dominion Voting sold to company run by ex-GOP election official" data-vars-item="in_content_link" data-vars-link-text="electronic poll books" data-vars-sub-category="story" href="https://www.ncsl.org/elections-and-campaigns/electronic-poll-books">electronic poll books</a>."</li></ul>
<p><strong>Zoom out: </strong>Leiendecker also has deep Republican connections.</p>
<ul><li>Matt Blunt, who was then Missouri's Republican secretary of state, appointed Leiendecker to a role investigating St. Louis' elections administration after the 2000 election.</li><li>As governor, Blunt later appointed Leiendecker to be St. Louis' Republican election director. </li></ul>
<p><strong>Ed Martin, a loyal Trump surrogate</strong>, was St. Louis' Board of Elections' chair when Leiendecker was the city's election director.</p>
<ul><li>As interim U.S. attorney for D.C. in Trump's current administration, Martin <a data-vars-click-url="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/28/us/politics/washington-prosecutors-demoted.html" data-vars-content-id="cae90de6-efda-49b6-a6b3-9cda6cc2162d" data-vars-event-category="story" data-vars-headline="Scoop: Dominion Voting sold to company run by ex-GOP election official" data-vars-item="in_content_link" data-vars-link-text="demoted" data-vars-sub-category="story" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/28/us/politics/washington-prosecutors-demoted.html">demoted</a> prosecutors who worked on Jan. 6 cases, <a data-vars-click-url="https://x.com/EagleEdMartin/status/1887901087983689761" data-vars-content-id="cae90de6-efda-49b6-a6b3-9cda6cc2162d" data-vars-event-category="story" data-vars-headline="Scoop: Dominion Voting sold to company run by ex-GOP election official" data-vars-item="in_content_link" data-vars-link-text="pursued critics" data-vars-sub-category="story" href="https://x.com/EagleEdMartin/status/1887901087983689761">pursued critics</a> of Elon Musk's DOGE operation, and <a data-vars-click-url="https://www.axios.com/2025/05/06/trump-dc-doj-ed-martin-thom-tillis" data-vars-content-id="cae90de6-efda-49b6-a6b3-9cda6cc2162d" data-vars-event-category="story" data-vars-headline="Scoop: Dominion Voting sold to company run by ex-GOP election official" data-vars-item="in_content_link" data-vars-link-text="threatened Wikipedia " data-vars-sub-category="story" href="https://www.axios.com/2025/05/06/trump-dc-doj-ed-martin-thom-tillis">threatened Wikipedia </a>over what he called biased "propaganda." </li></ul>
<p><strong>Liberty Vote officials </strong>describe Leiendecker as a neutral arbiter.</p>
<ul><li>They provided to Axios a supportive statement from Nevada's Democratic secretary of state, Cisco Aguilar, who called Leiendecker "open, honest and transparent."</li></ul>
<p><strong>Liberty does appear </strong>to be aligning itself with Trump's vision for a paper ballot-centered election system.</p>
<ul><li>For years Trump has cast doubt on the nation's election system, railing against voting machines, questioning their accuracy and calling for a transition to same-day, in-person voting using paper ballots.</li><li>Election officials nationwide have said that their electronic voting systems are secure, and that paper-ballot systems would result in longer waits for results without enhancing security. </li></ul>
<p><strong>What they're saying: </strong>Leiendecker told Axios in a statement that his company is "committed to delivering election technology that prioritizes paper-based transparency, security and simplicity so that voters can be assured that every ballot is filled-in accurately and fairly counted."</p>
<ul><li>"Liberty Vote signals a new chapter for American elections — one where trust is rebuilt from the ground up," he said. </li><li>A Liberty representative said the organization will engage in a "top-down" review of Dominion's equipment ahead of next year's midterm elections, and that it would "rebuild or retire" machines as needed.</li></ul>
<ul><li>States and localities that have used Dominion equipment in past elections now will have to decide whether to use Liberty's system in the future. </li></ul>
<p><strong>A Dominion representative referred </strong>questions about the acquisition to Liberty officials.</p>
<p><strong>Flashback: </strong>Trump and his allies falsely accused Dominion of engaging in a plot to steal the 2020 election for Joe Biden.</p>
<ul><li>Dominion later sued Fox News, whose on-air personalities had echoed Trump's claims, for defamation. Fox settled the case in 2023, and paid Dominion $787.5 million.</li><li>In August, <a data-vars-click-url="https://www.axios.com/2025/08/18/newsmax-dominion-lawsuit-settlement-2020-election" data-vars-content-id="cae90de6-efda-49b6-a6b3-9cda6cc2162d" data-vars-event-category="story" data-vars-headline="Scoop: Dominion Voting sold to company run by ex-GOP election official" data-vars-item="in_content_link" data-vars-link-text="Newsmax" data-vars-sub-category="story" href="https://www.axios.com/2025/08/18/newsmax-dominion-lawsuit-settlement-2020-election">Newsmax</a> agreed to pay Dominion $67 million to settle a similar lawsuit. </li><li>Even so, Dominion CEO John Poulos has said the attacks against his company severely damaged its reputation and <a data-vars-click-url="https://time.com/6280840/dominion-fox-news-voting-machines-john-poulos/" data-vars-content-id="cae90de6-efda-49b6-a6b3-9cda6cc2162d" data-vars-event-category="story" data-vars-headline="Scoop: Dominion Voting sold to company run by ex-GOP election official" data-vars-item="in_content_link" data-vars-link-text="jeopardized its future" data-vars-sub-category="story" href="https://time.com/6280840/dominion-fox-news-voting-machines-john-poulos/">jeopardized its future</a>.</li></ul>
<p><strong>The intrigue: </strong>As part of its deal with Dominion, Liberty officials asked Dominion to settle several other defamation lawsuits against Trump allies who attacked the company over the 2020 election results.</p>
<ul><li>In recent weeks, Dominion has reached undisclosed settlements with former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, former Trump lawyer Sidney Powell and One America News Network.</li><li>Dominion had sued Giuliani and Powell for $1.3 billion each. It had sued OANN for $1.6 billion.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Go deeper: </strong>Staple Street Partners, a New York-based private equity firm, has had a <a data-vars-click-url="https://www.axios.com/2023/05/01/fox-news-dominion-lawsuit-history" data-vars-content-id="cae90de6-efda-49b6-a6b3-9cda6cc2162d" data-vars-event-category="story" data-vars-headline="Scoop: Dominion Voting sold to company run by ex-GOP election official" data-vars-item="in_content_link" data-vars-link-text="controlling interest" data-vars-sub-category="story" href="https://www.axios.com/2023/05/01/fox-news-dominion-lawsuit-history">controlling interest</a> in Dominion since 2018.</p>
<ul><li>A Liberty official said regulatory approval wouldn't be needed in its acquisition of Dominion.</li></ul>
