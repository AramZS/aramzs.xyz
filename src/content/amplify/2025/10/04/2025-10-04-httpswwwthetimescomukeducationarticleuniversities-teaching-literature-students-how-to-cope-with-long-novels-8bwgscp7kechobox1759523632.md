<p>Universities are teaching English literature students how to concentrate long enough to read lengthy novels.</p>
<p>Some institutions are offering “reading resilience” courses for students facing long texts and reading lists while others are using book jacket design as part of the assessment process.</p>
<p>Academics said students in the past five to ten years, who had grown up with phones in their pockets, could be intimidated by reading long, older or more difficult books and the jump in pace from A-level.</p>
<p>Robert Eaglestone, the literary critic, is professor of contemporary literature and thought at Royal Holloway University, which gives advice to first-year students on how to tackle the required reading.</p>
<p>He said: “Across the board there’s a worry about reading. Of course it’s hard with a phone by your bed to start reading a novel — I don’t think anyone is immune to that or taking it lightly. At degree level, students are still reading whole novels and plays. However, there are lots of initiatives to help students read. Some universities do reading resilience courses.</p>
<p>“One thing we do, as do lots of places, when we induct our students on to the course, we give them advice on reading: put the phone out of the room, concentrate on your reading. Find somewhere comfy. Do it when you’ve got time. Be aware it takes time to get into the rhythm of a novel.”</p>
<p>John Mullan, professor of English at University College London, said: “In the last five to ten years, it’s true that fewer students are used to reading very long books. Most on our course at UCL are still willing to take on demanding texts, but that may not be typical. I do have friends in other universities who feel students are less willing to tackle older books or more difficult books.</p>
<p>“Some students are not used to sitting and reading a book for five or six hours. When we’re doing course planning, we’re thinking about that a bit more than we used to do.</p>
<p>“We react to unwillingness or difficulty with reading lengthy material by trying to get them to do it and not compromising too much. All first-year students have to do Old English, read the whole of <i>Paradise Lost</i> by their fifth week of term and Wordsworth’s preludes by the tenth week. Some bluff their way, but even to have to bluff with these texts is strenuous.”</p>

<p>Some universities are allowing students to tailor or design their English degrees and give support in how to write essays or read critically, to cope with the leap from A-level.</p>
<p>Southampton University assesses students on its English degree through the use of blogs, creative projects, module journals, portfolios and teamwork as well as written exams and dissertations.</p>
<p>• <a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/why-boys-arent-studying-english-a-level-gcse-school-nwc8dkd30"><b>Why boys aren’t studying English (and teachers don’t like it either)</b></a></p>
<p>Students are assessed through essays and independent projects at the University of the West of England, but also “have opportunities to demonstrate knowledge creatively and critically across several different forms including field trip reports, book reviews, book jacket designs, book pitches and podcasts”. Its website says: “The large variety of traditional and innovative assessments will strengthen your communication, presentation, creative expression, analytical and critical skills, and ensure your learning is skill-based and current.”</p>
<p>Kent University says students can tailor their studies according to their interests, exploring poetry, drama and prose but also “queer zines, films, artist books and video games”. Its website tags compulsory modules with colour-coded descriptions including “student favourite” and “in-demand skills” while one optional module on class is tagged as “tackles big questions”.</p>
<p>Hull University, where the poet Philip Larkin was librarian, includes a compulsory module where students choose what books to read. It says: “You’ll get the chance to work with tutors to create a personalised reading list, exploring texts that challenge and inspire you.”</p>

<p>Plymouth University tells students that English is a degree they can design by choosing from a wide range of modules in literary studies and creative writing “to shape a degree that reflects your interests and career goals”.</p>
<p>Brunel University says its teaching is shaped around the goal of developing students’ “reading resilience”, to be able to read, discuss and write about challenging texts with confidence.</p>

<p>The number of pupils taking English A-level has plummeted in the past decade, falling from the most popular subject to outside the top ten. Canterbury Christ Church University axed its English literature degree last year, Bournemouth University is winding up its course and Sheffield Hallam merged literature with language.</p>
<p>Experts blame GCSE English for deterring teenagers, describing GCSE literature as boring and repetitive and the language qualification as outdated and offputting.</p>
<p>They say the skills learnt from studying English — communicating, collaborating and thinking critically — are vital and valued by employers.</p>
<p>However, the government’s drive towards science and maths has compelled some <a href="https://www.thetimes.com/topic/universities">universities</a> to be more creative in what they offer and how it is assessed to attract students to English degrees.</p>
<p>Eaglestone blamed declining interest on the “terrible” English GCSEs, saying: “The literature is unbelievably boring and taught in a very boring way to pass the exam. English language GCSE is now completely incoherent, it’s had generations of stuff thrown into it.”</p>
<p>He supported universities running modules showing students how to study and write essays, saying it helped with the jump from A-level.</p>
<p>He added: “Despite the decrease in numbers, people doing it are really committed to the subject.”</p>
<p>English literature or language A-levels were taken by 58,000 entrants this summer, down from nearly 90,000 in 2015.</p>
<p>The English Association says full person equivalent numbers taking English degrees, not including creative writing or linguistics, have fallen from around 42,285 in 2019-20 to roughly 33,515 in 2023-24.</p>
<figure></figure><p>Mullan said the teaching of English degrees had changed over the past decade.</p>
<p>He said: “When I was a student, I don’t think people who taught me gave a damn about students’ opinions and they didn’t need to. It didn’t mean they didn’t care about you but the idea that what students wanted to study should be part of the plan was utterly remote.</p>
<p>“Now there is more worry about what you think students want to do. If we want them to do something that’s not at the forefront of their wishes, we have to do a job of explaining or persuading.”</p>
<p>Mullan said a UCL English undergraduate from 40 years ago would recognise the course. Of universities using diverse methods of assessments, he said: “It’s not so much a case of, can people still write, but more, how you can lure people who might be not confident about the required skills? It’s marketing. You have to make yourself look appealing. It’s about making the subject look possible and alluring.”</p>
<p>Student feedback now has a bigger role, he said, adding: “Sometimes there’s a danger academics chase student opinion, and can almost worry too much about what students say they want to study.</p>
<p>“I don’t think academics do any favours by bending to trends and fashions, whether for individual texts or movements. Those students who shout loudly and make most demands are not necessarily representative — I get others emailing me in confidence saying we just want to study Shakespeare.”</p>
