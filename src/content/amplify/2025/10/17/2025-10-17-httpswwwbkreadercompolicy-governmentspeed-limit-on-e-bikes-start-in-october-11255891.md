<p>E-bikes and E-scooters will be prohibited from traveling faster than 15 miles-per-hour on city streets starting on Oct. 24, according to New York City Mayor Eric Adams.</p>
<p>Once implemented, the 15 mph speed limit for e-bikes, e-scooters and pedal-assist commercial bicycles will match the same speed limit that currently applies to stand-up e-scooters.</p>
<p>"This new 15 miles-per-hour speed limit for e-bikes is about keeping New Yorkers safe while continuing to keep our city moving,” Adams said in a statement. “As more New Yorkers turn to e-bikes and e-scooters to get around our city, New Yorkers have asked us to set clear, consistent rules to address this issue and protect everyone."</p>
<p>The new rule mirrors best practices for e-bike speeds in many other areas of the world, including the European Union, and is part of the city's Department of Sustainable Delivery, which looks to bring order to New York City streets as the number of app-based deliveries and delivery workers soar, the mayor said.</p>
<p>“With record bike ridership and a historic expansion of our protected bike lane network, we're making it safer and easier than ever for the record number of New Yorkers choosing cycling by building infrastructure and providing education to meet the moment,” said New York City Department of Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez. “We are using every tool and studying worldwide best practices, to ensure every New Yorker is traveling at safe speeds on our streets.”</p>
