<h4> Editor At Large at LinkedIn </h4>
<p>There are few things media writers enjoy more than a villain. Particularly when it’s an expensive outsider conscripted to overhaul a storied newsroom or publication. </p>
<p>The protagonists in these situations sometimes stumble early — maybe it’s a stray comment or an ill-advised strategy doc — and as the leaks and tipoffs flow to beat reporters, the narrative of a workplace in turmoil builds, and soon enough some early missteps become the hapless leader’s defining narrative. </p>
<p>Right now, the archvillain is Bari Weiss, whose leadership role at CBS News has led to a frenzy of panic-stricken disclosures from anonymous staff, breathlessly recounted by media reporters.</p>
<p>Yet for the past 18 months, the industry’s primary object of scorn was The Washington Post’s publisher, Will Lewis. </p>
<p>The arrival of Lewis in January, 2024, marked the beginning of a turbulent and tempestuous chapter at the Jeff Bezos-owned paper. Lewis sparred with staff as he sought to shake up a complacent culture, and morale cratered. The exclamation point came with the sudden, dramatic departure of executive editor Sally Buzbee. </p>
<p>At this juncture, Lewis, a former CEO of Dow Jones, tapped <a data-test-link="" data-tracking-control-name="article-ssr-frontend-pulse_little-text-block" data-tracking-will-navigate="" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/matt-murray-50bbb5227/?trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_little-text-block">Matt Murray</a>, most recently the editor in chief at The Wall Street Journal, for what both assumed would be an ephemeral role. </p>
<p>The intention was to have Murray steady the ship over several months amid the growing tumult, and provide Lewis and Bezos the time to lure a new top editor to run the paper’s newsroom. </p>
<p>“The plans were evolving in real time, but the initial idea was to come in and take over the so-called third newsroom — an area trying to explore new areas of journalism — but in the interim, I could run the newsroom and be a temporary editor there,” Murray told me. “When I came in, there were some infamous moments — even on the first day. But I like the more open and rowdy workspace element of the newsroom. It's something I've always enjoyed.” </p>
<p>In the first month of Murray’s tenure, there was an assassination attempt on Donald Trump in Pennsylvania. As his reporting team swiftly mobilized, the event gave Murray a window into the potency of the talent, depth of experience and commitment of his staff. </p>
<p>“Obviously, that's a terrible event,” he says. “No one feels good when something like that happens. But as a news person, seeing dozens and dozens of people calling in and reporters in the field doing great work, you feel the adrenaline and the energy. There's nothing like being in a newsroom on a big and important breaking story.”</p>
<p>The paper’s coverage was so compelling it won a Pulitzer prize for The Post. For his part, Murray slowly began to win the (begrudging) respect of a despondent newsroom. </p>
<p>“I was watching and learning and thinking about areas where I thought there was room for improvement and what needed to be addressed,” he says. “As the months evolved, one of the things that struck me, and I talked about it quite a bit with Will, was that although the third newsroom is a great idea, the core newsroom of The Post could do a lot of things to update itself and get to a different place. Both things needed to happen.”</p>
<p>When Robert Winnett, the person Lewis selected to take on the executive editor role permanently — and another British editor with significant baggage — withdrew from the job before he had even started, Murray’s assumption that his role would be fleeting suddenly shifted.</p>

<p>After an elongated recruitment process once more marked by leaks, Bezos and Lewis installed Matt Murray in the executive editor chair on a permanent basis. </p>
<p>“I was coming in at a moment of tremendous transition and pressure,” he says. “But there was also a real desire for reinvention and rethinking of things. In our business, people move from one place to another, and their formula is to try to make the new place their former place. There was some unease when I got here around that because of my time at The Journal.” </p>
<p>Murray has since begun to steadily put his own imprint on The Post. </p>
<p>“I’m fully engaged in the reinvention plan,” he says “It’s challenging, fun and exciting all at the same time. This is a big newsroom that has been undergoing a lot of change, and we're still, in some cases, in the process of getting to know each other and see where we're going.”</p>
<p>Even so, it’s hard to ignore the enormous amount of talent that has walked out the door in the past 12 months. </p>
<p>“When you're undergoing change, feeling uncertainty, and the industry itself faces challenges and turmoil, there are going to be departures,” he concedes. “But there’s also going to be people wanting to come aboard, and part of my job is to be steady as that process unfolds.” </p>
<p>For Post readers, the quality and caliber of reporters who have left is disconcerting. Yet Murray is eager to counter the narrative that the exodus is indicative of the paper’s fading fortunes. </p>
<p>“I engage with most of the people who have outside offers or are contemplating leaving, and we've actually kept a fair number of people in those circumstances,” he says. “It’s reported who leaves, but it’s never reported who doesn't leave because, of course, nobody knows. We've actually been pretty successful with retaining some talent. And as some folks have left, some of those we've retained got new opportunities and have become rising stars. Josh Dawsey carried a big load for The Post over the years, but Hannah Natanson has emerged as a fantastic scoop-getter this year.” </p>
<p>Still, Murray must want to reverse the talent drain narrative and begin luring buzzy new talent of his own? </p>
<p>“You want to have a newsroom where everybody with talent and something to contribute knows they're valued,” he says. “And if for some reason it's not the right thing for them, that's OK. I've tried to engage with people and be direct and give them my feedback, tell them what I think we're trying to build, invite them if they want to be a part of it on those terms, celebrate with them if they go and thank them, but continue to move on. And The Post continues to attract large numbers of people who see opportunity here, who recognize what a large, robust newsroom it is and see how many scoops we're breaking and want to be part of that.” </p>
<p>With Lewis still in his chair and Bezos an omnipresent figure that looms over the entire operation, it seems plausible that talent retention and internal politics will remain significant throughout Murray’s tenure. </p>
<p>I asked Murray just how much of a distraction is The Post’s palace intrigue?</p>
<p>“It's a bit of a distraction, but not that much,” he says. “At The Journal, I oversaw a gigantic restructuring program once before. Being a senior leader there for a long time means I’ve grown a fairly thick skin, have made every mistake that you can make and, I hope, learned from it and developed some perspective on thinking about the long term versus the short term. I'm not perfect on any of those things, but I have been through them enough to keep them in mind.”</p>
<p>Murray demures slightly when I ask what it’s like to work with Jeff Bezos. </p>
<p>“I've been building a relationship with Jeff and it's not appropriate for me to say too much about what we talk about [specifically],” he says, carefully. “Those are private conversations. Overall, he's got a clear sense of his relationship to newsroom independence and what lines not to cross. People speculate, but he's a perfect owner in that regard.” </p>
<p>Bezos, Murray adds, retains robust ideas about the opportunities and “the social importance” of journalism, along with the relevance of coverage and the public’s desire for high-quality news. </p>
<p>“If he's got a frustration about The Post per se at times, it's that there's a great opportunity out there and he wants us to meet that opportunity,” Murray says. “And also when and why are we falling short of that opportunity. He's provocative in pushing us to think about that. He's a deep believer in the power of news, but he's a bit of an iconoclast, I'd say, (regarding) the format and how people get news. </p>
<p>“That's actually a pretty good place to be. I mean, he's very supportive of the mission and he's a broad thinker, but he’s not interfering in the details of doing it. He wants to support us in that mission and push us further. I think people might be surprised to hear me say it, but he believes in the mission, role and importance of journalism and what we can do more than many people I've met in journalism. You leave a conversation like that with an owner, and you feel pretty good.” </p>
<p>Murray went deep with us on his path to journalism, his almost three-decade-long stint at The Wall Street Journal and his recent strategies to overhaul The Washington Post’s newsroom. Here in his own words — lightly edited for space and clarity — he reflects on his career journey and the shifting global media and economic markets. </p>
<p>Both of my parents were writers. My mother was a book critic and children's author; my father was a part-time playwright who ended up in government. I grew up in Washington and ironically grew up reading The Washington Post in the 1970s and early ’80s. That was when The Post was at the height of its influence, in that era. I wasn't always sure if I wanted to be a journalist, but along the way, I became a big reader of the nonfiction writers of The New Yorker from the mid-century period... People like Tom Wolfe. And I thought, well, this could be a fun thing to do. </p>
<p>I went to college to major in journalism at Northwestern, but with the idea that if I wanted to leave journalism school, I'd still be at a good college. At some point, I fell in love with the idea of writing and reading and reporting on the world. So I started as a copy editor, and then became a police reporter in Chicago for a while. I was rather shy as a reporter. I didn't really have the natural affinity to just march up and ask people questions. But being a police reporter in the evenings in Chicago, I got to cover a lot of different things and have a lot of interesting experiences, and eventually it became what I wanted to do. Like a lot of people, I liked the fact that newsrooms are unruly and disorganized and not particularly professionalized. That was probably a little truer back then in the early ’90s. And I just loved writing. </p>

<p>I got to The Wall Street Journal a little bit through good fortune, and patience. Working as a police reporter in Chicago, I met a Journal editor there. My first (Dow Jones) job was based in Pittsburgh. I ended up doing a number of different jobs. I also wrote a book about my father and his life. </p>
<p>I always felt like I was probably going to end up as an editor. I have a certain kind of pedantic nature and a bit of a ‘rules’ grammatical stickler nature. My family is a bunch of know-it-alls. So I did become an editor eventually. </p>
<p>When The Wall Street Journal was sold to News Corporation in 2007, it marked a gigantic turning point and upheaval in that world. It went from this family-owned company to being part of News Corp. A lot of people left, they didn't want to work for Rupert Murdoch. I thought about leaving. But I decided I love being in newsrooms so much, I will give this a chance. It turned out that not only could I do the work I wanted to do, but, in some ways, I was a beneficiary of some of the changes and had opportunities I might not have otherwise had. </p>
<p>Eventually, through various happenstance, I found myself as the (top) editor there. I learned what it is to be an editor in this kind of modern, different era of journalism. </p>
<p>Lots of journalists have that turning point about whether they can go into management or not. There are some very hard things about it. But I like being in the office and around people. I'm not as good on my own, and writing is often a lonely process. I enjoy some of the management pieces of the puzzle — thinking about where the business is going and trying to understand how to grab readers and what works. </p>
<p>Murray steered The Journal through some significant periods of transition in the industry where younger reporters, who traditionally had been inclined to defer to more senior colleagues, began becoming much more vocal in the workplace. </p>
<p>I don't think it was unique to journalism. All of society was dealing with different aspects of that. There were the technological changes of social media and work tools like Slack which created different conditions for people to express themselves. The social currents encouraged people to speak up more and speak out more. I was reasonably comfortable with a lot of it. I have a pretty good memory of what I was like when I was a younger person starting out, and I had the feeling where, instead, I guess I would say I was just glad to be let into the building and I'm not gonna want to offend anybody. But the truth is, I was sarcastic and mouthy and said or did things sometimes. I needed a lot of feedback.</p>
<p>My philosophy was always to try to engage with people one-on-one. Try to hear them out, but also be honest, treat them like adults and talk to them directly. Sometimes in the workplace today, in general, you can get a group mentality going that can be a different kind of a pressure point… I try to have an open door to talk to people, let them know where I was coming from and hear where they were coming from. The hardest part sometimes in any job as a boss is you have to do things that just have to be done that you can't fully explain or (publicly) justify… That is very frustrating... You have to be thoughtful in those moments and how you do that. </p>

<p>I'll always have a very soft spot and a deep well of feeling for The Journal, as it was a big part of my career. I had a good relationship with (current WSJ editor in chief) Emma Tucker when I was there. The last thing Emma or any editor needs is a former editor hovering around, expressing views or opinions. It's not the right thing for her or for the organization. So, I have felt it was the right thing to keep the distance. </p>
<p>When I started at The Post, I went to news meetings, met with reporters, had coffees, met with editors. I was cautious early on about when to express myself so I didn't come in like a bull in a china shop. I did speak up at the news meetings, which was a different expectation that they had in a (top) editor, and I started expressing my views. </p>
<p>I'm now probably in the last few years of my career. One thing I've reflected on as I've gotten older, is I have regrets sometimes about not enjoying the moments I had, the friendships I had, the work I did, and the experiences in the moment because of the anxiety I felt. We sometimes are miserabilists in journalism, and after all, we do face real challenges. But we have incredible privilege and opportunity and joy in the work. We get to make these products in real time all the time. It's incredibly satisfying and fun work. So I have a little bit of perspective and that helps me on some of the rougher days. </p>
<p>What's my working relationship with Will Lewis like? He's always been incredibly supportive and loyal to me. When he became the CEO, Dow Jones was really in a very rough spot. Will turned it around over time and put Dow Jones on a certain pathway and course that it's really still following today. So I've seen that work with him. He's a sounding board for me. </p>
<p>We talk a lot as managers — and I'm very aligned with Jeff and Will on this — that The Post for a while was a very deeply political paper in every aspect. And for a while, that really worked. And even though politics remains important to The Post, our readers are in a different place today than they were six or eight years ago. They want a larger diversity of content. So we talk about what it means to have different kinds of content, areas of opportunity where we should go, how we should think about that. Will is very much a sounding board, an advisor and a collaborator. But he wants me to help bring him thoughts and solutions, and then he'll let me bounce them off him. The thing that Will helps me the most at — not unlike Jeff, but with some more specificity — is being a really hard driver of thinking about alternative and new and rising means of journalism. He likes to provoke me and all of the Post executives to really think about those areas. </p>
<p>There was a moment where some people were fearing that Jeff and Will would want a different take on Donald Trump. And the best way to counter that is tough reporting and scoops. I'm definitely a fact-based scoop kind of guy. I'm not one for opinion in daily news coverage, but in that context, I want to be tough and I want to be revelatory, and I want to get those stories. I think we've put our money where our mouth is quite successfully this year by breaking a ton of stories and continuing to show fact-driven, scoopy journalism is at the heart of what we do. There's nobody who's more enthusiastic about combative stories than Will, and one of the things Will likes to say to me is, ‘let's make trouble.’ So I think that energy and that scoopiness is something we wanted to do, and I think some people who stayed (working for us) have been part of that and are really glad and encouraged by it. </p>
<p>Is the print newspaper product still profitable? Yes. It's an important part of our product set. We are set up for the print product to be profitable for some time. It's also fair to say that print is not growing. Digital is growing. When I got here, a lot of editors were touching print. We want to keep the print product robust. But I also want most of our room focused on the growth areas, which are journalism, social off-platform kinds of journalism, video, things like that. Our recent changes to the print paper, made for technical reasons to do with our presses, led to a format change that upset some readers. But there wasn't a reduction of the total number of stories or journalism going into the print paper… We're pretty committed to looking for ways to keep print going and enhance it as much as we can as long as there's a market and audience for it. </p>
<p>One common thing competitors say about The Post is they can't believe it gave up on local coverage in D.C. The Town is such a fountain of stories. I asked Murray about The Post’s local coverage: Is there a case to reemphasize local coverage down the track? </p>
<p>I love local coverage. I was a local reporter for a long time early in my career. So I understand the comments you're hearing from people. Because of resources, because of the tension of local versus national, and because of different changes and priorities over many years and several editors, The Post has been a bit betwixt and between on local and national, and the reality is that the local staff has declined over time in different ways. The local readership also changed quite substantially — as it has for every local paper in the age of social media and the nationalization of all kinds of news. We're not living in the period anymore where your local print paper is the only source for all kinds of local news. And by the way, every modern newsroom needs many different kinds of skills while producing journalism 24/7 for digital audiences. </p>
<p>Right now we’re thinking through what's the right approach for local coverage in this era when everybody's got a phone in their pocket. One person I was delighted to have join The Post was Kimi Yoshino, who was an architect of building out The Baltimore Banner the last few years. It was a big coup for her to come here. One of the specific mandates for Kimi is (to navigate) the right proactive mission for local news that resets what our purpose and meaning are. We want to think about young and rising audiences and we’re kind of defining that mission. </p>
<p>How much does our newsdesk and the opinion desk work together? Opinion content and news content are completely separate. The head of opinion and the head of the newsroom are independent, each reports up to the publisher and CEO separately, and their operations run separately. That's always been the case at the Post. We sometimes have to talk together about production things. (Newly installed Post Opinion leader Adam O’Neal) and I are both executives of the company but we are very cautious and thoughtful about keeping that separate. There were times in our business in the last decade when the tension or the desire to be voicey brought too much opinion into news pages, and it's one of many factors that has sometimes caused readers to lose some trust in us. I want us in the news pages to distinguish ourselves through fact-based reporting and not through our opinions or attitudes. I understand why news organizations experimented with it, but the world needs a common set of facts and fact-based information that's reliable wherever you are on the political spectrum. </p>
<p>AI and all the tools and opportunities of AI are coming whether we like it or not. How news consumers adapt and embrace AI is developing in front of our eyes, and it's our responsibility to be where users are using it. Our product team generates all kinds of new products and ideas around AI. We want to serve readers the news as they want it. We’re making sure the technology serves the journalism and doesn't change what journalism is. The age of AI might even enhance journalism. There’s unique value in human-generated, reported and contextualized information. AI will be able to do some things as tools or processors, but it'll never contextualize in the same way. We want to make sure AI tools and products are in service of journalism and enhancing it. </p>
<p>We were too slow in our business when the internet came along. So we do not want to shrink from the opportunities that AI provides us both on our process and on our output. Readers and viewers are going to use AI themselves and incorporate it into their lives and our responsibility is to be there where they are. We've got to be where the users are today.</p>
