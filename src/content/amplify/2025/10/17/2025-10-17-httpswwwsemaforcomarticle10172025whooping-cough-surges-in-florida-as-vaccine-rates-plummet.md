<p>Whooping cough diagnoses in the US state of Florida rose 81% from 2024 to 2025, driven by a collapse in immunization.</p>
<p>Kindergarten vaccination rates in the state fell to <a href="https://eu.tallahassee.com/story/news/local/state/2025/10/08/florida-sees-sharp-rise-in-whooping-cough-infections/86551849007/">the lowest in more than a decade</a> in 2024, The Tallahassee Democrat reported, and below what is needed for herd immunity. Vaccine skepticism is up in much of the US, with a sharp partisan divide: Republican voters, led by the party leadership, have <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12116312/">become much less willing to vaccinate their children</a>, while Democrats have become slightly more pro-vaccine.</p>
<p>The result is that some previously well-controlled diseases have returned: There have been more than 1,500 measles cases nationwide and three deaths. Scientists warned that <a href="https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2025/04/measles-vaccination.html">the virus could become endemic again within 20 years</a>.</p>
