  Emma’s Torch helps refugees find a foothold through culinary training - The

<p>Emma’s Torch, with locations in D.C. and New York, is giving refugees a runway to employment.</p>
<p>Chef Briana White is standing in the kitchen at <a href="https://emmastorch.org/">Emma’s Torch</a>, a small daytime cafe in Northeast Washington, as she systematically butchers a large, black striped bass. She slides her knife down the length of the fish’s back and removes the first fillet, then puts it to the side. She turns the fish over and repeats the process. She then separates each fillet into a number of uniform serving-size pieces and arranges them on a parchment-lined sheet tray.</p>
