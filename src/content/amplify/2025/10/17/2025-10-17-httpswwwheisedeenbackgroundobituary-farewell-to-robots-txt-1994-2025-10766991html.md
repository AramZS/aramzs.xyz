<p>It is with deep sorrow that we announce the end of robots.txt, the humble text file that served as the silent guardian of digital civility for thirty years. Born on February 1, 1994, out of necessity when Martijn Koster’s server crashed under a faulty crawler named “Websnarf,” robots.txt passed away in July 2025, not by Cloudflare’s hand, but from the consequences of systematic disregard by AI corporations. Cloudflare’s decision to block AI crawlers by default merely marked the moment when even the last major infrastructure provider abandoned faith in voluntary compliance and moved to technical enforcement. This was a last act of desperation that signaled the end of an era. As with all significant losses, it took time for the full extent of this digital tragedy to be comprehended.</p>
<h3>A Life of Silent Service</h3>
<p>robots.txt was born in a time when the internet resembled a small, quiet neighborhood – manageable, personal, and characterized by mutual trust. One knew the bots that came by and maintained digital etiquette with each other. robots.txt, originally named “RobotsNotWanted.txt,” was never designed to fight complex legal battles or confront billion-dollar companies – it was simply a polite, yet firm, hint: “Please do not go this way.”</p>
<p>In its golden years, robots.txt lived in perfect harmony with the major search engines. Google respected it, Yahoo honored it, and even AltaVista – rest in peace – and Lycos followed its instructions. It was a give and take. It was a friendship on equal footing, marked by a simple truth: search engines received content for indexing, while websites, in return, got traffic. This crawl-to-referral ratio – the ratio of bot accesses to returned users – was a fair 14:1 for Google. For every 14 pages accessed by bots, a user on average found their way back to the website. Today, this contract is broken: AI crawlers generate thousands or millions of accesses, while hardly any traffic returns through links or mentions.</p>
<p><em>"Anthropics ClaudeBot showed by far the highest crawl-to-referral ratio in June 2025 – about 70,900 crawls per one referral, far more than any other AI crawler." </em></p>
<p>robots.txt was so fundamental to the functioning of the internet that in 2022, it was finally formally recognized with <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9309">RFC 9309</a>. Yet, even this late knighthood could not stop its fate.</p>

<h3>Chronicle of a Slow Death</h3>
<p>The first signs of change appeared in 2017 when the Internet Archive announced it would no longer consider robots.txt when archiving historical content. <a href="https://blog.archive.org/2017/04/17/robots-txt-meant-for-search-engines-dont-work-well-for-web-archives/">On April 17, 2017, Mark Graham</a> (Director of the Wayback Machine) stated that robots.txt files – especially those intended for search engines – do not always align with archival goals. The Internet Archive aims to preserve the most complete snapshots of the web possible, including duplicate or large content.</p>
<p><em>"Over time we have observed that the robots.txt files that are geared toward search engine crawlers do not necessarily serve our archival purposes." </em></p>
<p>But this was merely a prelude to the progressive, systematic exploitation that was to follow. With the advent of artificial intelligence, the internet transformed from a collaborative space into an extraction zone.</p>
<p>However, instead of the hoped-for collaborative partnership, systematic exploitation ensued. AI corporations erected new digital barriers: Cloudflare’s default blocking, paywalls for API access, and exclusive licensing deals with select publishers. Content creators found themselves facing an industrial extraction machine that profited from their work without compensation. The internet, once conceived as an open network for all, morphed into a centralized data mine for tech giants.</p>
<p>OpenAI led the charge with its GPTBot, ChatGPT-User, and OAI-SearchBot – a trinity of violations that left robots.txt helplessly watching its directives being diligently ignored. The company publicly claimed compliance, while in June 2025, Cloudflare documented a <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/control-content-use-for-ai-training/">devastating crawl-to-referral ratio of 1,700:1</a> – industrial extraction without meaningful return.</p>
<p>Anthropic added further to the suffering. ClaudeBot, anthropic-ai, and Claude-Web hammered servers, with iFixit experiencing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/25/24205943/anthropic-ai-web-crawler-claudebot-ifixit-scraping-training-data">one million visits in 24 hours</a> and Freelancer.com experiencing nearly four million in four hours. With a <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/control-content-use-for-ai-training/">crawl-to-referral ratio of 73,000:1</a>, Anthropic crossed all boundaries of decency – it was like entrusting a neighbor with your house keys to water the plants, only to find they had carted off all your belongings.</p>
<p>Perplexity AI was among the most aggressive actors: it used undisclosed IP addresses and third-party services to obscure crawling activities. When <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91144894/perplexity-ai-ceo-aravind-srinivas-on-plagiarism-accusations">CEO Aravind Srinivas publicly stated</a>, robots.txt was not a legal framework, it was an open affront to the decades-old fragile protocol.</p>
<h3>A Text File in the Shadow of the Last Stand</h3>
<p>In its final months, robots.txt fought desperately for the relevance of bygone days. Website operators developed increasingly sophisticated support systems: crawler fingerprinting with TLS analysis (Transport Layer Security), honeypot traps, and behavioral analysis. But it was like trying to treat acute blood poisoning with fever reducers – technically sound, but not equal to the scale of the threat.</p>
<p>The European Data Protection Board attempted to give the protocol legal force with its <a href="https://www.edpb.europa.eu/news/news/2024/edpb-opinion-ai-models-gdpr-principles-support-responsible-ai_de">Opinion 28/2024</a>, while Italy’s data protection authority, Garante, fined OpenAI <a href="https://www.garanteprivacy.it/home/docweb/-/docweb-display/docweb/10085432">with a fine of 15 million Euros</a>. But these were desperate resuscitation attempts of a system that had long collapsed – voluntary respect could no longer be saved.</p>
<p>Alternative protocols – ai.txt, TDM ReP, “No-AI-Training” HTTP headers – were discussed as potential successors. But they all carried the stigma of their birth: they arose not from cooperation, but from confrontation.</p>

<p>The Call for Proposals for <a href="https://enterjs.de/?wt_mc=intern.academy.dpunkt.konf_dpunkt_vo_enterJS.empfehlung-ho.link.link">enterJS 2026</a>, taking place on June 16 and 17 in Mannheim, has been launched. Until November 12, the organizers are looking for <a href="https://enterjs.de/cfp.php?wt_mc=intern.academy.dpunkt.konf_dpunkt_vo_enterJS.empfehlung-ho.link.link">presentations and workshops</a> on JavaScript and TypeScript, frameworks, tools and libraries, security, UX, and more.</p>
<h3>Death and Legacy</h3>
<p>robots.txt died as it had lived – quietly and unnoticed by many. When Cloudflare introduced its default blocking of AI crawlers in July 2025, it was not just a technical change – it was a capitulation to the end of digital civility. A protocol designed for a cooperative network community could not survive in an age of industrial data hunger.</p>
<p>The numbers speak a clear language about the extent of the loss: <a href="https://next.ink/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/TollBit-State-of-the-Bots-Q4-2024.pdf">TollBit analyses showed</a> that AI bot scrapes bypassing robots.txt grew by over 40 percent between Q3 and Q4 2024. It was not age that carried the protocol to its grave, but the systematic disregard by those who once respected it.</p>
<p>European and American jurisprudence reveal a divided world. While the EU, with GDPR, takes a restrictive stance and treats web scraping as personal data processing, US courts, following <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Buren_v._United_States">the Van Buren ruling</a>, prioritize innovation over creator rights.</p>
<h3>In Loving Memory</h3>
<p>robots.txt will be remembered as a symbol of a time when the internet was still characterized by mutual respect. It enabled the growth of the web by protecting server resources while granting access to legitimate crawlers. Its simple syntax (User-agent, Allow, Disallow) was poetry of clarity in an increasingly complex digital world.</p>
<p>The protocol taught us that technology can be based on human values like ethics and morality. It showed that voluntary compliance works when all parties benefit. Its greatest achievement was perhaps preserving the internet for three decades from what it has become today – a soulless extraction machine.</p>
<h3>The Future Without robots.txt</h3>
<p>The world after robots.txt is already visible. Content creators are retreating behind technical barriers, Cloudflare is becoming the new gatekeeper of the internet, and the open web is fragmenting into licensed silos. Where cooperation once reigned, legal battles and technical arms races now dominate.</p>
<p>The permission-based models emerging are the antithesis of what robots.txt once stood for. Instead of a simple “Please don’t,” they require complex authentication, payment, and legal contracts. The internet is growing up – and losing its innocence in the process.</p>
<p>Federated learning, privacy-enhancing technologies, and blockchain-based consent systems may be technically more advanced, but they can never replace the elegant simplicity that robots.txt embodied.</p>
<h3>Farewell Word</h3>
<p>When robots.txt was born, the internet was a place of hope and collaboration. It died in a world where billion-dollar companies systematically steal the work of content creators while claiming to democratize knowledge.</p>
<p>robots.txt deserved a monument – not of stone, but of code, of ones and zeros. Instead, it will be buried in the archives of the RFC editor, while AI crawlers continue to plunder the digital graveyards it once sought to protect as binary grave robbers.</p>
<p>robots.txt, 1994–2025: You were too good for this world.</p>
<p>The funeral will take place in the form of a technical specification. Instead of flowers, the community requests donations to the Electronic Frontier Foundation for the fight for digital rights. A robots.txt file will be included with the grave – ironically, the first one that will actually be respected.</p>
<p>Requiescat in pace, robots.txt. The internet was a better place with you.</p>
<h3>Autopsy: Anatomy of a Digital Legend</h3>
<h5>External Examination</h5>
<p>robots.txt was a simple UTF-8 encoded text file placed in the root directory of a website (e.g., example.com/robots.txt). The protocol was based on groups of rules that gave specific instructions to each crawler.</p>
<p>A look inside the protocol reveals its elegant simplicity:</p>
<h5>Syntax Structure:</h5>
<pre><code>User-agent: [Bot-Name]    # Definiert den Crawler
Allow: [Pfad]             # Erlaubte Bereiche  
Disallow: [Pfad]          # Verbotene Bereiche
Crawl-delay: [Sekunden]   # Verzögerung zwischen Anfragen
Sitemap: [URL]            # Verweis auf XML-Sitemap</code></pre>
<h5>Key Technical Details:</h5>
<ul><li><strong>User-Agent Matching</strong>: Crawlers looked for the most specific group matching their user agent. If no specific group existed, the wildcard group “*” applied.</li><li><strong>Wildcard Support</strong>: The “*” denoted zero or more characters of any kind, and “$” marked the end of a path for exact matches.</li><li><strong>Rule Priority</strong>: In cases of conflict between Allow and Disallow rules, the longest (most specific) rule took precedence. If specificity was equal, the less restrictive rule applied.</li></ul>
<h5>RFC 9309 Specification:</h5>
<p>Published in 2022, RFC 9309 formalized the protocol developed by Martijn Koster in 1994, adding definitions for error handling, caching directives, and extended syntax.</p>
<h5>Special Characters:</h5>
<ul><li># for comments</li><li>* for wildcards (0+ any characters)</li><li>$ for end-of-path marker</li></ul>
<h5>Practical Challenges:</h5>
<p>Implementing RFC 9309 compliant parsers was surprisingly complex. The matcher syntax with wildcards and group-based processing made the seemingly simple protocol a "learn to master, hard to master" problem.</p>
<h5>System Limitations:</h5>
<ul><li><strong>No Authentication</strong>: robots.txt was purely advisory and could not enforce anything.</li><li><strong>Case-Sensitivity</strong>: URLs and paths were case-sensitive (/path ≠ /Path).</li><li><strong>Parsing Differences</strong>: Different crawlers interpreted complex rules differently.</li><li><strong>Caching</strong>: The recommended cache time was up to 24 hours.</li></ul>
<h5>Google's Implementation:</h5>
<p>Until 2023, Google used a separate parser for Search Console, which had slight differences from the production crawler. Only in 2023 was the open-source production parser used uniformly.</p>
<h5>HTTP Status Code Handling:</h5>
<p>A 403 status code when fetching robots.txt resulted in all rules being ignored – 403 and 404 were treated the same as “robots.txt unavailable.”</p>
<p>robots.txt began as an improvised gesture of trust and became an RFC-standardized system – only to ultimately fail due to its greatest weakness: the belief in fairness in a world long programmed for maximum data extraction.</p>
