title: Learn about upcoming changes to Gmailify & POP in Gmail
---
<p>Starting January 2026, Gmail will no longer provide support for the following:</p>
<ul> <li><strong>Gmailify:</strong> This feature allows you to get special features like spam protection or inbox organization applied to your third-party email account. <a href="https://support.google.com/mail/answer/6304825">Learn more about Gmailify</a>.</li> <li><strong>POP:</strong> This feature allows you to read your messages from a third-party account in Gmail. Unlike IMAP connections, POP only works with a single device and doesn’t sync your email in real time. Instead, emails are downloaded, and you decide how often you want to download new emails. As an alternative, you can still link your third-party accounts in the Gmail app.</li> </ul>
<p>These changes help provide the most secure and current options to access your messages in Gmail.</p>
