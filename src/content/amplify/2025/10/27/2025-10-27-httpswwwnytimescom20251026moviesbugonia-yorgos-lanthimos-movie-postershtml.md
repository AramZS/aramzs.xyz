<p>Bizarre circumstances and deadpan dark humor define the films of the Greek auteur Yorgos Lanthimos. His latest, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/23/movies/bugonia-review.html">“Bugonia,”</a> about two cousins who kidnap a powerful woman they suspect is an extraterrestrial being, delivers on both counts.</p>
<p>Since his 2009 breakout feature “Dogtooth,” Lanthimos has only worked with one artist to create posters as mind-bending as the films themselves: the graphic designer Vasilis Marmatakis. The two met in the early 2000s while working in advertising alongside Efthymis Filippou, who frequently writes screenplays with Lanthimos.</p>
<p>“Vasilis tries to visualize a profound aspect of the film through the image that he creates, something that really represents the film without explaining it, so the connection between the poster and the film is synchronous,” Lanthimos said via video call.</p>
<p>For Marmatakis, who starts working on each poster as soon as the screenplay is completed, what draws him to Lanthimos’s films is that “they are dark, pop and funny,” he said from Athens. “And they are visually stunning, so I have really amazing material to work with.”</p>
<p>And while Lanthimos has achieved international success, his collaboration with Marmatakis is a compatriot affair. “We always discuss things in Greek,” the designer added.</p>
<p>Below, Marmatakis provides insight into how his posters interpret Lanthimos’s stories.</p>

<p>Marmatakis had long been a fan of the New Zealand typeface designer Joseph Churchward, and thought his Brutalist font known as Churchward Roundsquare fit with the dark sci-fi themes of “Bugonia.” “It looked really futuristic,” Marmatakis said. “It has really sharp edges and feels monumental, but in a very D.I.Y. way.” He first reached out to the Museum of New Zealand, then connected with Churchward’s estate, and eventually got in touch with the designers who were appointed by his daughter to digitize it. Marmatakis also handcrafted the credits, which he first printed out and then brushed with water to distort the letters.</p>

<p>In “Dogtooth,” three siblings grow up having almost no contact with the outside world. Before landing on this minimalist design, Marmatakis and Katerina Papanagiotou, a former partner at MNP, the creative studio they ran together then, explored other versions that featured aspects of the world that the children would never experience. “We had a series of posters with a polar bear, Niagara Falls, a rave and just ‘Dogtooth’ underneath,” he recalled. Ultimately they opted for a simple visual representation of distortion. “We created this symbol with the three lines representing each child painting their own way and then meeting at the end,” Marmatakis said.</p>

<p>Since “Alps” follows a group of people who lurk around hospitals and graveyards waiting for someone to die and then offer to pretend to be the deceased in their loved ones’ lives, Marmatakis created a meta poster. It was designed as a flier “as if they did it themselves and they would hand it out,” he said. “It’s completely handmade.” He printed out the photos of the characters, cut them out and glued them into a collage. “It’s black-and-white because the characters would have just photocopied it.”</p>

<p>Two hands hugging the outline of an empty rectangular poster was the first idea that Marmatakis had to interpret the film’s reality, in which single people must find a romantic partner or be transformed into an animal of their choosing. But the designer didn’t feel satisfied with the rigid look. Eventually the empty space took on a more amorphous shape. “Of course, it depicts loneliness, but then again, you don’t know what Colin Farrell is hugging, if it’s real or not, or if it’s even a human. It could be an animal,” he said. “I tried to visualize this emotional hollowness.”</p>

<p>Farrell plays a surgeon and family man confronted with an enigmatic threat to his idyllic life. “I tried to depict the feeling of being hopeless in a very sterile medical environment,” Marmatakis said. The elongated verticality of the poster reflects an inescapable situation with no harmless outcome. “When you go to the hospital and something happens to you or someone you love, you feel useless,” he said. “You are at the bottom of this well with no end. There are also two beds in front of him, which is the choice he has to make in the film.”</p>

<p>Flipped horizontally, a side profile of Olivia Colman as the fickle Queen Anne in 18th-century England resembled the image of Queen Elizabeth II that appears on stamps or coins. Marmatakis then toned down the color of her skin. Is she dead? That’s the doubt the designer wanted to cast. “Her lovers are on her face; one is holding a brush and the other one is holding a pearl necklace. You don’t know if they are adorning her or killing her,” he said. “They’re two insects, doing things on her and manipulating her, which is what happens in the film.”</p>

<p>If you look closely at the swashes of color that adorn the close-up of Emma Stone’s face, you’ll find images of the people who molded the life of her character, Bella Baxter, a person with the body of an adult woman but a child’s developing brain. “Kids sometimes try to look like grown-ups, and they put makeup on,” he said. “And then I thought it would be interesting if these colors are the men. You don’t know if the men put this on her or if she did it to herself to look good.”</p>

<p>A minor character, R.M.F. (Yorgos Stefanakos), who dies and then is resurrected, connects the three stories in this anthology. “I wanted to use this character as a dead body, who is also kind of alive,” said Marmatakis. To create the effect of worms swarming a corpse, he placed photos of Emma Stone’s character dancing on his portrait. “Then I thought, ‘I cannot just have Emma Stone a thousand times,’ so I put the other characters on it, each in slightly different colored clothes, on top of a brown surface that is just Emma Stone dancing, which is quite funny.”</p>
