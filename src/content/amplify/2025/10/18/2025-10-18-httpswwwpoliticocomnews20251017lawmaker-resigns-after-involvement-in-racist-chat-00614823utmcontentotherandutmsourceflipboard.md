<p>“I know that this decision will upset many, and delight others, but in this political climate I must keep my family safe,” Douglass said, adding that his resignation will be effective Monday at noon. “Since the story broke, I have reached out to the majority of my Jewish and BIPOC friends and colleagues to ensure that they can be honest and upfront with me, and I know that as a young person I have a duty to set a good example for others.”</p>
<p>His <a data-tracking="mpos=center&amp;mid=ar_body&amp;lindex=67&amp;lcol=" href="https://www.politico.com/f/?id=00000199-f48f-d77a-add9-ffaf75040000">lengthy statement</a> also cites hateful messages he received from others in his state since the story broke.</p>
<p>Douglass’ resignation comes as <a data-tracking="mpos=center&amp;mid=ar_body&amp;lindex=68&amp;lcol=" href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/15/new-york-dems-newest-political-cudgel-the-hate-laced-young-republican-chat-00611022">at least six others in the chat are out of jobs</a> since POLITICO began reporting on the exchanges. He served as the chair of Vermont’s Young Republicans organization.</p>
<p>In one portion of the chat, Douglass refers to an Indian woman as someone who “just didn’t bathe often.” In another instance, Brianna Douglass, Sam’s wife and the Vermont Young Republican’s national committee member, says her husband may have erred by “expecting the Jew to be honest.”</p>
<p>The Vermont state lawmaker initially resisted strident calls to resign from top state Republican leaders — including Scott and the <a data-tracking="mpos=center&amp;mid=ar_body&amp;lindex=69&amp;lcol=" href="https://x.com/VTHouseGOP/status/1978227461407080763">GOP conferences</a> in the state’s House and Senate.</p>
<p>One day after POLITICO published its initial story about the Telegram group, Douglass <a data-tracking="mpos=center&amp;mid=ar_body&amp;lindex=70&amp;lcol=" href="https://www.sevendaysvt.com/news/politics/facing-calls-to-resign-sen-douglass-says-he-is-weighing-options/">apologized for the chat</a>, saying “I am weighing all my options.”</p>
<p>Douglass was a first-year lawmaker and said Friday he was proud to pass his first bill on agriculture and begin his work to reform the state’s welfare system.</p>
<p>“I will continue to do what I have done my entire life, the very reasons why I was elected; I will help others in my community, be active, foster communication, and look out for others,” he said.</p>
