<p>Los Angeles County officials voted on Tuesday to declare a state of emergency over ongoing federal immigration raids.</p>
<p>The proclamation gives the county the power to assist residents they say have been impacted financially by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) action.</p>
<p>The declaration was introduced by County Supervisors Lindsey P. Horvath and Janice Hahn and passed by a 4-1 vote, with Supervisor Kathryn Barger opposing.</p>
<p>Los Angeles County is home to over 3 million immigrants, according to supervisors, who said the ICE raids have "caused widespread fear" and led to "decreased attendance at workplaces, disruption of local economies, and strain on critical services such as schools, hospitals, and places of worship."</p>
<p>Rent relief for tenants who have fallen behind as a result of the ICE raids and money for legal aid and other services are among the provisions in the declaration.</p>

<p>The vote on Tuesday allows county supervisors to mobilize resources, request state and federal financial assistance to respond to the impacts of the raids and expedite contracting to address the crisis.</p>
<p>"What’s happening in our communities is an emergency — and Los Angeles County is treating it like one," said Horvath in a press release."Declaring a Local Emergency ensures that the full weight of County government is aligned to support our immigrant communities who are being targeted by federal actions."</p>
<p>ICE raids started in Los Angeles early June, prompting demonstrations that at times turned violent.</p>
<p>While Trump’s deportation push was initially said to be centered around undocumented immigrants with criminal records, an ABC News analysis of data <a data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/raids-started-fear-spread-la-mayor-bass-trumps/story?id=123902468">in July</a> showed that the Trump administration has arrested an increasing number of migrants with no criminal convictions.</p>
<p>"For months, families have lived under threat and workers have been taken from job sites," Horvath continued. "This proclamation is about action and speed — it allows us to move faster, coordinate better, and use every tool available to protect and stabilize our communities. We will continue to stand with our immigrant neighbors — today, and for as long as it takes."</p>
<p>The emergency declaration will remain in effect until terminated by the board, according to the release.</p>
