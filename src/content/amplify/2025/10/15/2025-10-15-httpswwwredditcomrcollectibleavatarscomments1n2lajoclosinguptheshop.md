  After an incredible journey of creating a new way for redditors to express
  themselves through Collectible Avatars, establishing a badass roster of
  creators through GEN drops, and then opening up the floodgates to allow anyone
  to create on Reddit, we have made the very tough decision to sunset the Avatar
  Creator Program.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Well, this is one of <em>those</em> posts. The kind that we hoped we would never have to write.</p>
<p>After an incredible journey of creating a new way for redditors to express themselves through Collectible Avatars, establishing a badass roster of creators through GEN drops, and then opening up the floodgates to allow anyone to create on Reddit, we have made the very tough decision to sunset the Avatar Creator Program.Â </p>
<p>The Creator Program wasnâ€™t just a feature, it was a full blown movement that rocked Reddit, on the blockchain no less. You all built communities. You created art. Your art became memes. You put <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ConeHeads/">a cone</a> on it. You even got paid (a first!). At the end of the day, you all made magic. From the very beginning, this community turned something experimental into something extraordinary. You transformed Reddit by showing what was possible when creators were empowered to create, play, and showcase excellence. Weâ€™re so proud of everything that we have built together and even more proud of the community that stayed strong throughout it all (looking at you GEN 3 ðŸ‘€).</p>
<p>When (or WEN) you ask? We are working on wrapping things up as smoothly as possible, but here are some key dates/takeaways:</p>
<ul>
<li>As of <strong>today</strong>, we will no longer be accepting new submissions from creators, but all remaining submissions will be reviewed by the end of September.Â </li>
<li>The Avatar shop will remain open for business until <strong>November 11th</strong>.</li>
<li>Youâ€™ll still be able to use Collectible Avatars you have purchased. However, we will be removing the Collection Display on profiles on <strong>November 11th</strong> and on-platform NFT transfers on <strong>January 1, 2026</strong>. <del>We donâ€™t have concrete timing on this, but will share an update when we do.</del>
<ul>
<li>We REPEAT: Avatars themselves will still be available as a means of self-expression.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>100% of secondary sale royalties will go to creators moving forward. We will update the contracts within the next three weeks to direct all secondary sale fees to creators, relinquishing Redditâ€™s cut.</li>
<li>We will also be removing the in-app Vault feature. You have until <strong>January 1st, 2026</strong> to export your blockchain wallet by copying your 12-word recovery phrase from your Vault Settings. See <a href="https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/articles/40377768199444/">How do I export my Vault?</a> to learn more.

<ul>
<li>We will continue to honor off-platform transfers and sales through a simplified import flow. Youâ€™ll be able to claim avatars on Reddit by tapping the <em>visit Reddit to make it your avatar</em> link shown on the product page where you acquired them. See <a href="https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/articles/40643146058900/">How do I import my Collectible Avatar?</a> to learn more.Â </li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>As for this community here, we will leave <a href="https://reddit.com/r/CollectibleAvatars">r/CollectibleAvatars</a> as is, but there wonâ€™t be any new content coming through from the Admin side. Feel free use it as an archive of what was one of the most colorful corners of Reddit.</p>
<p>You all truly left a mark - a big, sometimes glittery, meme-filled, and wonderfully unforgettable mark that we will forever be grateful for. ðŸ«¡</p>
<p>EDIT: Added ðŸ«¡</p>
<p>EDIT: Added a date for Collection Display to be removed on November 11th and on-platform transfers being removed on January 1, 2026. </p>

<div class="md"><p>Hi! We're sending through an update on some of the questions that we've seen floating around on other communities, and consolidating some of the most frequently asked ones here. We will continue to keep an eye out on things and will share future updates here.</p>
<p><strong>Does this mean I can't use my Collectible Avatars on Reddit anymore?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Although we are sunsetting a few features, your Collectible Avatars can still be used on Reddit. Youâ€™ll still see them in your avatar builder, make them your avatar, and be able to mix and match. That said, if you want to do anything with your collectibles off-platform such as transferring or selling, itâ€™s important that you grab your recovery phrase and <a href="https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/40377768199444-How-do-I-export-my-Vault">export your Vault</a> before January 1, 2026.Â Â </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Will the blue hexagon treatment remain?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Yes! You will still have the hexagon frame appear around your Collectible Avatar.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Will I still be able to mash?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Yes! You will still be able to mix and match your Collectible Avatars. Any creations that you make will still be your avatar that appears in your profile, posts and comments.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What happens if I donâ€™t export my Vault?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You will still be able to use your Collectible Avatars as you are today on Reddit, but you won't be able to transfer them, sell them, or export them to use outside of Reddit.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Are off-platform transfers only honored after January 1, 2026 after Vaults go away?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We'll continue to honor off-platform transfers after Jan 1. We will be rolling out a simplified claim flow that will require recipients/buyers to follow the steps <a href="https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/40643146058900-How-do-I-import-my-Collectible-Avatar">here</a><strong>.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How do I best protect my collection?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Before January 1, 2026, when Vaults are removed, you will need to <a href="https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/40377768199444-How-do-I-export-my-Vault">Export your Vault</a> to get your 12-word recovery phase. This can be used with third party software and ensures that you can continue to control your Collectible Avatars (i.e transferring or selling on the blockchain).Â </li>
<li>If you would like an additional layer of protection, you can back up the IPFS metadata (image and JSON). Reddit currently provides this data and is not planning to stop, so this is optional. However backing it up on your own can be a good protection. To do this, tap your Avatar in the Avatar Builder and then "View Details." Tapping "View on IPFS" will show you the image and tapping "IPFS Metadata" will show you the JSON metadata. Make copies of these and store them in a safe place, and repeat for the Collectible Avatars in your collection.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: Adding 2 more Q's/updates:</p>
<p><strong>When will the Collection Display go away?</strong></p>
<p>The Collection Display on profiles will be removed on November 11th, 2025.</p>
<p><strong>When will on-platform NFT transfers go away?</strong>Â </p>
<p>On-platform NFT transfers will be removed on January 1, 2026, the same day Vault will be removed.Â </p>
