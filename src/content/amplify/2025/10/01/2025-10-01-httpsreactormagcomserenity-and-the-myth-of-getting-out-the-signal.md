  it's not always that simple.

<p>Since its premature cancellation after only eleven episodes in 2003, the sci-fi western series <em>Firefly </em>has attained mythic status in fandom spaces. Much like the plucky Browncoats’ fight against the centralized Alliance at the center of the series, <em>Firefly</em> itself has become symbolic of the little guy sacrificed at the altar of network corporate interests. I was absolutely an obsessive <em>Firefly</em> fangirl back in the day (friends in grad school used to call me “the prophet of Whedon”—which I cringe about for so many reasons now). In the intervening 20 years, criticism of the show has become more accepted, in at least some corners of fandom. Main critiques concern the show featuring an Asian-inspired setting with no Asian main actors, the attempt to invoke the vibes of the Confederacy without the inconvenient detail of slavery, and Mal’s patronizing attitude towards Inara’s profession as a companion.</p>
<p>I share all those issues with the series, and I have gotten into more than a few heated online discussions about them with die-hard fans. More recently, though, I have found myself pondering a specific problematic detail of the 2005 follow-up movie <em>Serenity</em>: the fixation on “getting out the signal.” Spoiler alert for a 20 year old movie, but as you may recall, <em>Serenity</em> follows Mal and our beloved crew as they discover the secret of the planet Miranda. The savage Reavers who loom as a threat throughout the borders of the core planetary system were in fact created by the Alliance themselves after a botched attempt to drug and pacify an inhabited planet. The climax of the film revolves around the crew of Serenity trying to “get out the signal” of this truth to the wider planetary system. In the end, they do accomplish this feat. While victory comes at great cost (R.I.P. Wash, you were a leaf on the wind), the sacrifice feels earned in the context of the film because truth won out.</p>
<p>But is getting out the signal really enough?</p>
<p>This is the question I find myself asking more and more about <em>Serenity</em>. The whole dramatic tension of the film hinges on the idea that an oppressive government can be significantly impacted, or even toppled, if only the population is able to know some fundamental <em>truth </em>about them that has previously been hidden. Throughout <em>Firefly</em>, Mal and the crew of <em>Serenity</em> exist outside of any significant political power or influence. Their primary goal (especially Mal’s) is basically just to get another job and keep flying for another day. That changes in the film, where the right piece of secret information about the corrupt Alliance government actually gives them the power to do something beyond continuing to survive. It’s a nice fantasy—but it’s worth unpacking <em>why</em> it’s such a fantasy.</p>
<p>To be sure, the idea of “getting out the signal” is not contained to <em>Serenity</em>. It is actually something of a staple trope in science fiction that aims at exposing conspiracy theories or toppling a corrupt government. We might think of the 1973 film <em>Soylent Green</em>, ending with the iconic scene of Charlton Heston’s character discovering the secret ingredient of the popular food supplement and being dragged away by the authorities while shouting out the famous line: “Soylent Green is people!” Sure, we may not know what happens to Heston’s character after the film ends, but simply uncovering the secret of soylent green and shouting it to anyone who may be able to hear him offers at the very least a satisfying conclusion to the narrative.</p>
<p>A reality-changing piece of knowledge is at the center of <em>The Matrix</em>. Keanu Reeves’ Neo is given the choice by Laurence Fishbourne’s Morpheus to take the red pill or blue pill. Neo takes the red pill and awakes to the whole nature of human reality being an elaborate lie. The idea of “red-pilling” became so insidious that in the 2010s we started seeing “red pill” communities pop up online, specifically to advocate for “men’s rights,” in communities that claim to have seen the underlying truth of the feminist agenda that actually seeks to subjugate men. It’s worth noting that the most significant real-life application of this framework from the Matrix did not expose a conspiracy, but just managed to birth new conspiracies in the realm of the online “manosphere.”</p>
<p>Outside of online conspiracy websites, there is no doubt something compelling in the idea of there being some secret truth in the world (often being hidden by those in power) that we can obtain or share to assert a sense of agency over reality—especially for those who feel powerless. If we just find the right scandal or we uncover the right conspiracy, we actually can bring down bad actors. We can make the people around us see the truth right before their eyes. Can’t we?</p>
<p>I have to confess: it seems like getting “the signal” out does not change very much. We live in a moment when we are in fact inundated with information. It seems like every day there are new scandals uncovered. We can see war crimes documented on our phones as we scroll through puppy videos. New atrocities are reported; a politician gets caught on a hot mic. For years, we’ve been navigating a political and media landscape where it feels like surely <em>this </em>time <em>this </em>will be the moment things change. Evil is not sneaky or subtle in our historical moment! And yet the sudden revolutionary change never comes.</p>
<p>If you’re like me, the fact that so many people in our world (friends, neighbors, family) seem unwilling or unable to process what we think should be reality-shattering information gets pretty demoralizing. It’s depressing seeing people that we love base their lives and their political allegiances on information we know is absolutely wrong. We want to feel like we can save the world (or at least our families) with the right piece of information. We want to believe if we can just win one more debate maybe someone will fundamentally change their fundamental outlook on life. Unfortunately, people do not work that way. Maybe part of the problem is that we have been fed a false narrative about the idea of “getting out the signal.” That narrative is at best naive, and at worst arguably dangerous when applied to the real world.</p>
<p>The truth is that sustained change—whether personal or political—takes real effort and investment in relationships, especially when it comes to changing world views. There is a lot said and written these days about political division and polarization. Those political lines are certainly very real, but we both over and underestimate them when we reduce those differences purely to the realm of ideas and knowledge. More and more our political allegiances have become markers of true identity, as individuals and within our communities. To change a political opinion is not just about a change of ideas but about changing a sense of who we are and how we understand the world at a core human level.</p>
<p>There is an excellent moment in the film <em>Children of Men</em> when Clive Owen’s Theo walks into a raging battle with young mother Key and her newborn child. No child has been born in the world of the film for over eighteen years. That lack of hope for humanity’s future is the driving force of so much violence throughout the film. Seeing this new birth is a moment of awe and wonder for militants on both sides, who immediately pause their fighting. As soon as the moment has passed, shooting resumes. On one level it is not what we would expect from such a dramatic moment. Shouldn’t the soldiers involved now realize they have a common cause to fight for together, not against one another? At the same time, there is something so fundamentally human about that inability to process such instantaneous change at a momentary (even so dramatic) revelation. That scene in <em>Children of Men</em> might be less inspiring than the moment Mal presses play on the broadcast at the end of <em>Serenity</em>, but it feels more honest.</p>
<p>The attraction of a film like <em>Serenity</em> with its “get out the signal” storyline is that it sells the idea of a single dramatic, high-stakes moment as the catalyst for wide-ranging systemic change. In the context of a sci-fi action-adventure film franchise, that triumphant ending may be earned through some dramatic sacrifice (once again, we miss you Wash), but it is still cleanly defined at the moment. Maybe if there’s something I really have an issue with in <em>Serenity</em> it’s that while Mal is inspired by a desire to potentially take down the Alliance, he does not have a deeper interest in helping anyone beyond that. Mal and the crew of Serenity live their lives on the outer rim of “the system.” They’re not resistance fighters. One might even argue that they’re not even do-gooders. That idea of just trying to survive life on the rim (“You can’t take the sky from me” as it were) is a huge part of what made <em>Firefly</em> as a series so compelling, but it also makes the one-off heroes of <em>Serenity</em> feel somewhat hollow. Throughout the series, Mal is motivated primarily by his own internal sense of righteousness. One might even argue that his drive to “get out the signal” was less about helping to create a more just world than it was about the desire simply to prove that the Alliance is, in fact, wrong–if he can “get out the signal,” he has successfully proven himself and his worldview to be correct, and is absolved of that harder, ongoing work of bringing about change day after day. That idea is enticing, but it also sets us up for frustration and failure.</p>
<p>I was thinking about these issues with <em>Serenity</em> when I went to see James Gunn’s <em>Superman</em>. It has to be said that this summer’s newest iteration of Superman falls a bit into the trap, bringing down Lex Luthor by Lois Lane and Jimmy Olsen’s investigative journalism outing his scandalous ties to the fictional country of Boravia. I am willing to give the film a pass on the trope, however, as the discovery of Luthor’s involvement in Boravia serves a narrative function in providing information to the audience. Not to mention we get to see Lois Lane’s journalistic super-powers in action. More significantly, the film’s real climax comes when Superman confronts Luthor with a powerful declaration of Superman’s own humanity: “I’m as human as anyone. I love, I get scared. I wake up every morning and despite not knowing what to do, I put one foot in front of the other and I try to make the best choices I can. I screw up all the time, but that is being human and that’s my greatest strength.” Doing right by the world is a choice we make every day, even when it is imperfect and may not even feel that heroic. It also asks a lot more of us on a personal level.</p>
<p>Despite the tone of this column, I am not a <em>Firefly </em>hater. After all, we wouldn’t have had Alan Tudyk’s robot voice or Nathan Fillion’s bowl-cut sporting Green Lantern in <em>Superman </em>if <em>Firefly </em>had not catapulted them to fandom star status. I do, however, firmly believe that as fans we should be the most aware that the stories we tell shape how we view reality. Dramatic moments or “getting out the signal” might make for a nice, contained narrative in a movie like <em>Serenity</em>. Living in the political reality of 2025, is it worth taking a step back and asking if there is a danger in that narrative. Does the story of “getting out the signal” set us up with the wrong objective—leaving us certain we can find that one piece of information that we can use to change hearts and minds. For better or worse, human relationships ask more of us than that. Maybe that is the message we need to get out.</p>
