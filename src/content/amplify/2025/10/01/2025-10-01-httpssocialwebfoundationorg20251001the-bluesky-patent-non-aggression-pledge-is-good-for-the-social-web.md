title: The BlueSky Patent Non-Aggression Pledge is Good for The Social Web
---
<p>We are happy to see the <a data-id="https://bsky.social/about/blog/10-01-2025-patent-pledge" data-type="link" href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/10-01-2025-patent-pledge">patent non-aggression pledge</a> published by <a data-id="https://bsky.social/" data-type="link" href="https://bsky.social/">BlueSky</a> today.</p>
<p><a data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_patent" data-type="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_patent">Software patents</a> and related intellectual property can have a dampening effect on innovation in an entire application domain, such as distributed social networks. They make developers use complex, roundabout methods to do simple tasks, just to avoid the appearance of using a technique that may or may not be patented by another company now or in the future.</p>
<p>By offering this pledge, BlueSky makes it that much easier for everyone in this entire area — not just those working on ATProto or closely linked technologies — to more safely explore techniques without worrying about <a data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent_troll" data-type="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent_troll">patent trolls</a> pouncing on them or their users sometime in the future. It was a brave and generous step on their part.</p>
<p>The ActivityPub specifications, including Activity Streams, are covered by the <a data-id="https://www.w3.org/policies/patent-policy/" data-type="link" href="https://www.w3.org/policies/patent-policy/">W3C Patent Policy</a> which gives good protection from patents by the specification creators and the W3C member organizations. Patent licensing is an important advantage of working in an open standards organization.</p>
<p>With the BlueSky patent pledge, another distributed social networking protocol and its related technologies are free to explore and re-use with less worry about paying royalties to a patent holder. It’s a good step forward in the ecosystem.</p>
<p>We hope companies and projects in other distributed social network ecosystems follow up on this step by releasing their own patent pledges, or developing their standards in an open standards organization like the W3C.</p>
