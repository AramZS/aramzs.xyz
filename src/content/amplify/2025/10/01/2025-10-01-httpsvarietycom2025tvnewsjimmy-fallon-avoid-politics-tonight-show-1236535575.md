<p><a data-tag="jimmy-fallon" href="https://variety.com/t/jimmy-fallon/">Jimmy Fallon</a> plans to keep “<a data-tag="the-tonight-show" href="https://variety.com/t/the-tonight-show/">The Tonight Show</a>” out of politics.</p>
<p>During a recent interview with CNBC’s “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmsP_qBBz_Q">Squawk on the Street,</a>” the late-night frontman said his show has “never really been political,” and he plans to keep it that way.</p>
<p>“We hit both sides equally, and we try to make everybody laugh, and that’s really the way our show works,” Fallon said. “Our monologues are kind of the same that we’ve been doing since Johnny Carson was hosting ‘The Tonight Show.’ So really, I just keep my head down and make sure the jokes are funny.”</p>

<p>“I have great writers,” he added. “And we’re just trying to make the best show we possibly can and entertain everybody.”</p>
<p>Discussion surrounding politics on late-night TV has consumed the industry ever since <a data-tag="jimmy-kimmel" href="https://variety.com/t/jimmy-kimmel/">Jimmy Kimmel</a> was temporarily <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/nexstar-jimmy-kimmel-abc-charlie-kirk-1236522584/">pulled off the air</a> for his commentary on the <a href="https://variety.com/2025/politics/news/charlie-kirk-dead-shot-1236514498/">death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.</a></p>
<p>ABC, which has hosted Kimmel for 24 seasons, sidelined “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” after Nexstar Media and Sinclair, two major U.S. TV station owners, vowed to preempt the late-night program after Kimmel said in his Sept. 15 monologue that the “MAGA gang” was trying to build political momentum off Kirk’s murder.</p>
<p>The announcements came shortly after FCC chair Brendan Carr <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/brendan-carr-abc-fcc-jimmy-kimmel-charlie-kirk-1236522406/">seemed to suggest</a> that broadcasters should take action against Kimmel for his comments on Kirk. He said on Benny Johnson’s podcast, “We can do this the easy way or the hard way. These companies can find ways to change conduct and take action, frankly, on Kimmel or there’s going to be additional work for the FCC ahead.”</p>
<p>ABC put Kimmel back on the air Sept. 22, and <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/jimmy-kimmel-fully-back-abc-tv-nexstar-sinclair-1236530517/">Nexstar</a> and <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/sinclair-resumes-jimmy-kimmel-live-abc-stations-1236530166/">Sinclair</a> did the same days later. After Kimmel’s return, <a data-tag="donald-trump" href="https://variety.com/t/donald-trump/">Donald Trump</a> took to <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/trump-disney-abc-jimmy-kimmel-return-bunch-of-losers-1236526488/">Truth Social to sound off</a> on the late-night show.</p>
<p>“Why would they want someone back who does so poorly, who’s not funny, and who puts the Network in jeopardy by playing 99% positive Democrat GARBAGE,” he wrote. “He is yet another arm of the DNC and, to the best of my knowledge, that would be a major Illegal Campaign Contribution. I think we’re going to test ABC out on this. Let’s see how we do. Last time I went after them, they gave me $16 Million Dollars. This one sounds even more lucrative. A true bunch of losers! Let Jimmy Kimmel rot in his bad Ratings.”</p>
