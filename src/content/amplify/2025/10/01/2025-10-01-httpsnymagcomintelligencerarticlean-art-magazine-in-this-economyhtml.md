<p>In April, a friend texted me to ask if I was planning to go to <em>Cultured</em> magazine’s “CULT100” party and, if not, whether I wanted to. “No” and “no,” I replied, mostly because I had no idea what <em>Cultured</em> was. A few nights later, my Instagram feed was flooded with pictures from the party, which was held at the Guggenheim a few days before the Met Gala and attended by a mix of buzzy actors, comedians, designers, writers, artists, and art-adjacent personalities. The party celebrated <em>Cultured</em>’s second annual “CULT100” list, a ranking of those “actively shaping and changing our culture in real time,” ranging from celebrities like Walton Goggins and Sarah Jessica Parker (both in attendance) to newly discovered artists. The event included a monologue by <em>Saturday Night Live</em>’s Chloe Fineman, a live version of Kareem Rahma’s <em>Subway Takes</em>, and a reading by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. It was, in other words, a powerhouse showing for a magazine that didn’t even register a few years ago.</p>
<p>Founded by the editor and art collector Sarah Harrelson, <em>Cultured </em>has actually been around since 2012. “It wasn’t taken seriously — it was seen as a kind of Hamptons party rag, socialite fodder,” said an art journalist. “And then it totally exploded.” It looks kind of like <em>Vogue</em> — chock-full of luxury ads and full-bleed images on high-quality paper, with celebrities increasingly appearing on made-for-Instagram covers — yet it focuses mainly on the art world. Also like <em>Vogue</em>, the journalism isn’t really the point. <em>Cultured</em> is more of a high-end lifestyle brand with a publishing arm, and has become known for well-curated events that manage to convene people of influence and book multiple sponsors without feeling cheesy. At the very least, the magazine looks good on a coffee table.</p>
<p>When I suggested people know the magazine more for its image than anything they’ve read in it, Harrelson winced. “I actually feel like people read <em>Cultured</em> a lot,” she said in an interview in <em>Cultured</em>’s Chelsea office. She is also sensitive about the perception that <em>Cultured</em> is a newcomer to the magazine game. “I have a strong relationship with my reader base, and I have a strong relationship with my advertisers,” said Harrelson. “Hermès, Cartier, Chanel — they’ve been with me nine years, every issue.”</p>
<p>But Harrelson, a workhorse of an operator, has made her unique ability to convene different kinds of people, both on the page and at exclusive lunches at her house in Beverly Hills or garden parties in the Hamptons, a hallmark of the enterprise. “I have people come up to me and say, ‘Because of you, I met this person and got a film deal,’ ‘Because of you, I got this museum show,’” she says. Sarah Arison, the president of MoMA’s board, told me, “Sarah has just built up this extraordinary community of people I genuinely want to hang out with. It’s not like, <em>Ugh, I’m going to a dinner. I’m going to be seated next to somebody terrible</em>. She curates, and I love that it’s always a mix of artists and curators and fashion people.”</p>
<p>It can be easy to forget that this is what the magazine business once was, especially for glossier publications. Advertisers want to be associated with beautiful and/or wealthy and/or interesting people, and those people want to flaunt their doings somewhere — like, say, a not-so-hard-hitting magazine that is unlikely to ask uncomfortable questions. This is especially true of galleries and other cultural institutions that can’t rely on social media alone to get the word out. “At a time when it’s becoming tougher and tougher to sell ads, and the business model is transitioning from advertising revenue to subscriber revenue, there becomes less impetus to invest in telling these types of stories and getting the type of access to these types of people, who are also the types of people a lot of brands want to associate themselves with on a high level,” said Adam Abdalla, founder of the art public-relations agency Cultural Counsel. “I think <em>Cultured</em> is one of the last places where that can live. And they’ve been smart about giving back to that community that supports them as well.”</p>
<p>Above all else, <em>Cultured</em> seems to have benefited from a vacuum that didn’t exist in the days when Harrelson, 53, was first trying to make it as an editor. “The very early definition I had of success in New York — it’s been well documented that it no longer exists,” she says. As fashion magazines and art journals alike have been consolidated or killed, the print-focused <em>Cultured</em> has become one of the only games in town, and not only for advertisers: It provides a valuable service to art-curious and high-net-worth individuals as an almanac of collectors, curators, and artists to know now. “It’s not very critical; I get the sense she’s personally close with a lot of these people and that’s how they’re wrangling them,” said someone who has written for <em>Cultured</em>. “It’s kind of a bummer when you know that the text you’re writing is so that there’s something to run next to an ad,” they added. “But hey, they throw a good party.”</p>

<p>Harrelson grew up in Rumson, New Jersey, a “preppy and homogenous suburb” where “I felt like I never fit in,” she says. She went on to study politics at NYU and had a string of internships — at <em>Elle</em> magazine, in the administration of then-governor Mario Cuomo — before moving to Miami, where she knew no one. “I decided, <em>I don’t think I can climb the ladder fast enough in New York City</em>,” Harrelson recalled, opting instead for a smaller market where she’d have “more creative freedom” and “a little more agency.” In Miami, she realized she wanted to be more than a writer; she wanted “to be in charge of the whole package,” she said.</p>
<p>The next few years were full of stints at various publications in various cities: <em>Women’s Wear Daily</em> and <em>W </em>magazine in Los Angeles, <em>Seventeen</em> in New York, and eventually back to Miami, where she founded the Miami<em> Herald</em>’s in-house<em> Home and Design</em> magazine, serving as editor-in-chief for six years. In 2007, she became editor-in-chief of <em>Ocean Drive</em> magazine and, as part of that job, <em>Art Basel </em>magazine. “That was kind of my first exposure to the art world,” she said, and she became “hell-bent” on getting into it. At 38, she started <em>Cultured.</em> “Certainly spent many, many, many years not quite getting to exactly where I wanted to go,” she said. “I want to be successful. I’m driven by being successful.”</p>
<p>An art collector herself, Harrelson has access to other collectors and celebrities in a way many who chronicle the art world do not; she “is part of the ecosystem,” as she put it. “I spend a lot of time with this group that I cover. This is what I do in my free time. If I go on vacation, I go to a museum, I meet with a curator there, I try to do a studio visit,” she said. “One of the greatest privileges of this job is being friends with artists and being able to spend time with them.”</p>
<p>Harrelson and her husband, Austin, an interior designer, sold their house in Miami in 2019 — “right before the market went crazy,” she notes — and headed to Los Angeles. “It was obviously a burgeoning art scene, with galleries opening and Frieze Art Fair being established by Bettina Korek,” said Peter Malachi, who leads communications for Hermès USA (and was himself featured on the 2024 “CULT100” list). “Sarah understood very clearly the dynamics at play within that art world.” These days, she splits her time between Beverly Hills and New York, where she opened an office last April.</p>

<p>Harrelson’s personal and professional relationships helped the magazine score cover stars like Swizz Beatz and Alicia Keys, whom she met through mutual friends and at various events. The artist Rashid Johnson, whose mid-career survey is currently on view at the Guggenheim and served as the backdrop for the “CULT100” event, was on the cover back in 2016, not long after Harrelson had met and done a studio visit with him. She also had an eye for talent. The expansion of the art world in the past decade “has afforded me a lot of loyalty because I was able to cover people who are now superstars,” she said. “I spent many years never being pitched the best story. Part of the reason I started the “Young Artists” franchise was because I couldn’t get the big artists.” That franchise identified many artists before they had major gallery representation or mainstream recognition, like Jordan Casteel and Diedrick Brackens.</p>
<p>David Zwirner remembers <em>Cultured </em>coming on his radar in 2017, when his son was interviewed for a piece on their gallery. “Following that, I kept on hearing about the magazine, especially because they were covering not only artists, but curators and gallerists,” he said. Zwirner noted that <em>Cultured</em> last year partnered with fashion brand MZ Wallace — co-founded by Zwirner’s wife, Monica — to award a $30,000 prize to one of the artists honored on the “Young Artists” list; the prize will return this year.</p>
<p>“I think the strategy is definitely on point — making it about lifestyle, being personality driven, where the people you’re covering are a proxy for the consumer that luxury brands are trying to market toward,” said one art-media veteran. “Do I think it’s particularly interesting or worthwhile content? I do not.”</p>
<p><em>Cultured</em>’s reputation on that front may be changing. The section of the magazine called “Critics’ Table,” which showcases monthly roundups, on-the-ground scene reports, and written-through features, has built new goodwill as other art publications — and <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/do-media-organizations-even-want-cultural-criticism.html">media organizations more broadly</a> — have deprioritized the role of the cultural critic. “It’s filled a void in art media and has helped consolidate a lot of the art credibility I think could have been in jeopardy for putting these crazy people on the cover,” said another art journalist.</p>

<p>“If you had asked me five years ago what I thought about <em>Cultured</em>, I would have said this is a vanity project. And my opinion has radically changed,” said an art publicist who now sees <em>Cultured</em> as “one of the pillars” of art coverage. “It’s worth talking about the parties that pay for that and how savvy she’s been with her relationships with brands and her willingness to be a little open to having some squishy editorial guidelines when it comes to working with brands,” the publicist continued. “But it’s created a home for art criticism that doesn’t exist anywhere right now beyond, perhaps, the New York<em> Times</em>.”</p>
<p>“Critics’ Table,” which requires a subscription to access online, is overseen by co-chief art critics John Vincler and Johanna Fateman, who joined <em>Cultured</em> last September after years of contributing to <em>The</em> <em>New Yorker</em>’s “Goings On About Town” section. “<em>Cultured</em> wasn’t on my radar as a place for criticism, but I was very impressed by the artists they covered and profiled. And they were consistently ahead of the pack,” said Fateman. “So I knew that, regardless of the <em>kind</em> of coverage <em>Cultured </em>was doing before, they were covering the right subjects. To me, that pointed to a kind of savvy I wasn’t seeing other places.”</p>
<p>Harrelson says the magazine has been profitable since 2018, though any magazine can be profitable with a small enough overhead. <em>Cultured</em> now consists of 11 full-time staff members, four of whom were hired in the past six months, including Ian Malone, who joined as director of brand and events from <em>Vogue</em>, and a dedicated fashion-advertising seller. Still, the magazine is heavily reliant on freelancers and continues to operate like a start-up. “Sarah is really good at creating a buzz and making you feel like you’re a part of something, but the demands are high and the pay is low,” said a former <em>Cultured </em>staffer.</p>
<p>Harrelson claims she has not taken any outside money or put any of her own into the operation, which is “self-sustaining” and “has never lost money,” she said. Asked how, she noted she has “been willing to do things maybe other people weren’t willing to do — things in unsexy cities, with too little of a team.” For many years, she said, she worked side jobs in addition to the magazine, including a “big consulting job” she had as recently as 2022. Print advertising accounts for more than half of the magazine’s revenue, followed by events, digital advertising, and subscriptions.</p>
<p>The first “CULT100” party had been held at the Morgan Library in celebration of cover stars Gwyneth Paltrow, Bowen Yang, and Rachel Sennott. The Guggenheim reached out to <em>Cultured</em> afterward, saying it would like to host the next one. Harrelson wouldn’t say how much Guggenheim charged her to rent the space, but “it was an expensive party,” she said, and they “hit pretty close to break even.” There were multiple sponsors, including Valentino, Molteni, and Fiji. “I’ve activated with Valentino for a very long time,” said Harrelson, who maintained that <em>Cultured</em> did not pay celebrities or anyone else to attend. “I have a lot of relationships,” she said. “The people that do know <em>Cultured</em>, I do feel there’s this sense of ownership because they have watched us. They’re like, <em>Wow, she’s been going at that a long time.</em>”</p>
