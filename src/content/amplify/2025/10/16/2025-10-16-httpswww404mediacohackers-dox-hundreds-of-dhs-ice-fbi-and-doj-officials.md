  Scattered LAPSUS$ Hunters—one of the latest amalgamations of typically young,
  reckless, and English-speaking hackers—posted the apparent phone numbers and
  addresses of hundreds of government officials, including nearly 700 from DHS.

<p>A group of hackers from the Com, a loose-knit community behind some of the <a href="https://www.404media.co/hackers-mined-at-t-breach-for-data-on-trumps-family-kamala-harris/"><u>most significant data breaches</u></a> in recent years, have posted the names and personal information of hundreds of government officials, including people working for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).</p>
<p>“I want my MONEY MEXICO,” a user of the Scattered LAPSUS$ Hunters Telegram channel, which is a combination of a series of other hacking group names associated with the Com, posted on Thursday. The message was referencing a claim from the DHS that Mexican cartels have <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/news/2025/10/14/bounties-originating-mexico-offered-shoot-ice-and-cbp-officers-chicago?ref=404media.co"><u>begun offering thousands of dollars</u></a> for doxing agents. The U.S. government has not provided any evidence for this claim.</p>
<p>404 Media reviewed multiple spreadsheets posted in the group’s Telegram channel. One contained the alleged personal information of 680 DHS officials; another contained data on more than 170 FBI email addresses and their owners; and the third contained the apparent personal information of more than 190 Department of Justice officials.</p>
<p>“Mexican Cartels hmu [hit me up] we dropping all the doxes wheres my 1m [1 million],” another message reads.</p>
<p><b><strong>Do you know anything else about this data dump? Do you work at any of the agencies impacted? I would love to hear from you. Using a non-work device, you can message me securely on Signal at joseph.404 or send me an email at joseph@404media.co.</strong></b></p>
<p>Using data collected by <a href="https://www.district4labs.com/?ref=404media.co"><u>cybersecurity company District 4 Labs</u></a>, 404 Media corroborated some of the data posted to Telegram. It showed that many parts of the dox did relate to government officials with the same name, agency, address, or phone number. In some cases, the addresses posted by the hackers appear to relate to residential addresses rather than offices.</p>
<p>It is not clear how the hackers collated or otherwise sourced this data, be that by combining previous diffuse data breaches, or by obtaining it from a government-specific breach.</p>
<p>DHS has repeatedly said that its officers are facing a wave of doxing and physical threats in the second Trump administration. Most recently <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/news/2025/10/09/dhs-condemns-dangerous-doxxing-and-escalating-threats-against-federal-law?ref=404media.co"><u>the agency said</u></a> officials “are facing a more than 1000% increase in assaults against them and their families are being doxxed and threatened online.” It is not clear how exactly DHS is quantifying those events to calculate that increase.</p>
<p>The U.S. government has taken action against apps, websites, and social media pages it claims are doxing or otherwise threatening DHS and ICE officials. In many cases, those apps were participating in First Amendment protected speech and were not doxing officials. Apple, for example, <a href="https://www.404media.co/apple-banned-an-app-that-simply-archived-videos-of-ice-abuses/"><u>removed one app called Eyes Up</u></a> that was aggregating videos of ICE activity and abuses. Apple banned a wave of apps <a href="https://www.404media.co/iceblock-owner-after-apple-removes-app-we-are-determined-to-fight-this/"><u>after direct pressure</u></a> from the Department of Justice.</p>
<p>These apps also gained popularity after masked ICE agents who refused to identify themselves repeatedly raided communities of immigrants and picked people off the street often without explanation. Recently ICE’s activity has included <a href="https://x.com/ReichlinMelnick/status/1975899183644356640?ref=404media.co"><u>shooting a priest in the head</u></a> with a projectile; flooding Chicago neighborhoods <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/14/us/chicago-ice-protesters-crash?ref=404media.co"><u>with chemical irritants</u></a>; and <a href="https://www.koin.com/news/portland/video-ice-detains-threatens-oregon-man-despite-u-s-citizenship/?ref=404media.co"><u>detaining and threatening U.S. citizens</u></a>.</p>
<figure></figure><figure></figure><p>The data dump by Scattered LAPSUS$ Hunters is more clearly an attempt at a mass doxing event.</p>
<p>The hacking group that posted the dox emerged from the Com, short for community. On Discord servers and Telegram channels, thousands of fraudsters, scammers, hackers, and gamers carry out hacks, beef with one another, and commission physical violence. A number of loose-knit groups have emerged from that community, including Scattered Spider which was responsible for the massive <a href="https://www.404media.co/how-the-fbi-tracked-and-froze-millions-sent-to-criminals-in-massive-caesars-casino-hack/"><u>ransomware attack against MGM Resorts</u></a>, and LAPSUS$ which was responsible for a wave of extortions against gaming companies, <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/who-is-lapsus-hacking-gang/?ref=404media.co"><u>including Electronic Arts</u></a>.</p>
<p>The name Scattered LAPSUS$ Hunters is an amalgamation of several of those names. This iteration gained notoriety recently after <a href="https://www.404media.co/behind-the-blog-sinkholes-and-site-seizures/"><u>threatening to publish a wealth of data</u></a> related to Salesforce customers, including Disney/Hulu, FedEx, Toyota, UPS, and more.</p>
<p>In 2016, another hacking group called Crackas With Attitude <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/hacker-publishes-personal-info-of-20000-fbi-agents/?ref=404media.co"><u>posted the personal information</u></a> of around 20,000 FBI agents and 9,000 DHS officials.</p>
<p>Neither the DHS, FBI, or Department of Justice responded to requests for comment.</p>
<p>“U guys want IRS next?” the hackers wrote in another message.</p>
