  Fun Facts: The Impact of Joke Proximity on Encoding Facts from the Main
  Stories on Last Week Tonight with John Oliver
---
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Drawing from Dynamic Human Centered Communication Systems Theory (DHCCST), this study examines how humor influences the acquisition of factual information from comedic news, using an experimental design with a recognition task and a psychophysiological measure. Participants paid greater attention, indicated by heart rate deceleration, to facts that followed the presentation of a joke in the main stories on <i>Last Week Tonight with John Oliver</i>. Humor enhanced recognition of facts presented in close proximity both before and after jokes, indicating better encoding of facts, particularly when the facts and proximal jokes were related.</p>
