  Back in April I wrote about Kagi, a premium search engine that I found fixed
  many of my gripes with the state of the modern internet. Kagi recently
  launched Kagi News, and it’s designed to make keeping up with the news both
  easier and less overwhelming.

<p>Back in April I wrote about <a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2025/04/testing-kagi-a-premium-search-engine-for-a-broken-internet/">Kagi</a>, a premium search engine that I found fixed many of my gripes with the state of the modern internet. Kagi recently launched <a href="https://news.kagi.com/">Kagi News</a>, and it’s designed to make keeping up with the news both easier and less overwhelming.</p>
<p>As the company explained in a <a href="https://blog.kagi.com/kagi-news">blog post</a> announcing its launch, Kagi News sifts through thousands of RSS feeds from publications around the world, representing a variety of viewpoints; news sources are open source and community-curated through a public <a href="https://github.com/kagisearch/kite-public">GitHub repository.</a> It then uses AI to generate summaries of stories, prolifically citing sources along the way. Instead of a constantly updating feed, Kagi News publishes one update a day, around noon UTC.</p>
<p>Kagi News, unlike Kagi Search, is free and can be used without an account. It’s deeply customizable; users can add and remove topic areas and choose what language they’d like to read their news in, with automatic translation through Kagi’s translation service. There are also filters for those among us who would rather avoid news about particular topics, and article views can be reordered and personalized to suit each reader’s needs. News is available both on the web and as an iOS/Android app.</p>
<p>In my testing, I’ve found Kagi News to be impressive if a bit fallible. I’m a fan of how each summary is peppered with citations; hovering over a citation with your mouse will bring up a box with links to original sources. However, sometimes the AI summaries may not totally match up with headlines; under a headline titled “President Trump threatens NYC funds if Mamdani elected,” the AI summary veered further into local politics than I would have expected:</p>

<p>I’ve set up Kagi News so that each story includes a quote, but those quotes don’t always come with the context that they need:</p>

<p>Kagi is clear that News is in beta, and I’ve found that even in this early stage it does an admirable job of delivering on the promise of making news easier to parse. Until, that is, I open the inbox full of newsletters waiting for me.</p>
