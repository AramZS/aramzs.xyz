<p><i><figure><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/heather-knight"><img alt="Heather Knight" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/09/21/reader-center/author-heather-knight/author-heather-knight-thumbLarge.png"/></a></figure><p><i>By </i><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/heather-knight">Heather Knight</a></p><blockquote><p>Reporting from San Francisco</p></blockquote></i></p>
<p>Marc Benioff, the chief executive of Salesforce, shocked San Franciscans last week when <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/us/marc-benioff-san-francisco-guard.html">he said that he “fully supports” President Trump</a> and wants National Guard troops deployed to their city.</p>
<p>But his allegiance to Mr. Trump goes much further.</p>
<p>Screenshots of internal documents and communications obtained by The New York Times show that Salesforce has pitched Immigration and Customs Enforcement on using the company’s artificial intelligence capabilities to help ICE staff up as Mr. Trump expands immigration raids and deportations around the country.</p>
<p>Mr. Benioff’s support of the National Guard ran counter to the city’s famously liberal underpinnings and to his own reputation as a benefactor of progressive causes. San Francisco leaders, already outraged by those remarks, were upset to learn on Thursday that the homegrown company was trying to help Mr. Trump with his immigration crackdown.</p>
<p>The internal documents include a five-page memo sent on Aug. 26 that explained how Salesforce is best suited to help the agency with “talent acquisition” to achieve its goal “to nearly triple its work force by hiring 10,000 new officers and agents expeditiously.”</p>
<p>Other Salesforce documents included a spreadsheet of ICE “opportunities,” the company’s term for possible contracts, as well as an internal brainstorming slide deck about how artificial intelligence agents might help ICE evaluate information sent to the agency’s tip line and improve investigations.</p>
<p>The internal information was provided to The Times by an individual with ties to Salesforce who was granted anonymity because the person was not authorized to share it. The Times described the documents to Salesforce, and the company did not dispute their authenticity.</p>
<p>Mr. Benioff declined to comment publicly for this article, and a Salesforce spokeswoman said the company does not discuss contracts. The company said in a statement that it has served the U.S. government under many administrations and that all of its customers are bound by company policies to use its products responsibly.</p>
<p>Salesforce, which also contracted with ICE under the Obama and Biden administrations, is far from the only tech company helping ICE drastically expand its enforcement efforts under Mr. Trump. Palantir, the Denver-based software company co-founded by the conservative billionaire Peter Thiel, is a major partner of ICE. Microsoft and IBM also have contracts with the agency.</p>
<p>Tech leaders have increasingly catered to Mr. Trump this year, from giving him gifts in the Oval Office to joining him at state dinners, as Mr. Benioff did in England last month. Critics have suggested that the executives are well aware that Mr. Trump can help their companies thrive — or try to punish them in various ways.</p>
<p>Salesforce relies heavily on federal contracts and is looking to expand that business line. Mr. Benioff said in an earnings call on Sept. 4 that the U.S. government is “our largest and most important customer” and that its contracts across numerous departments are worth billions to the company. He cited the U.S. Army, U.S. Coast Guard and the Veterans Affairs Administration among the agencies that use Salesforce products.</p>
<p>“But we’re starting to expand what we do even more,” he said.</p>
<p>Deep in the company’s most recent earnings report is an acknowledgment of the risks of relying on government contracts. Politicians could change their policies, or budgets could dry up. And some partnerships might hurt the company’s image.</p>
<p>“Our relationships with certain government entities may result in negative publicity or reputational harm,” the earnings report states.</p>
<p>Salesforce is in various stages of trying to sign new ICE contracts, with some already completed, according to the spreadsheet tracking business possibilities with the agency.</p>
<p>The Aug. 26 memo, a response to a request for information issued by ICE, explained how Salesforce is an “ideal platform” to modernize ICE’s hiring process and “implement an aggressive, high-yield marketing strategy” to reach recruits. Salesforce can help ICE, it says, “identify, engage and acquire the talent profile proven to drive ICE mission success, and in turn, administration priorities.”</p>
<p>When a Salesforce account executive posted in the company’s Slack channel dedicated to discussing “sales and business development for ICE” that this document was “out the door,” her colleagues responded with fire emojis and the word “amazing,” according to a screenshot of the conversation.</p>
<p>“I wish you the best of luck with this one!” another colleague wrote.</p>

<p>San Francisco leaders were surprised on Thursday to learn that one of the city’s signature tech companies, with a rocket-shaped skyscraper that defines the city’s modern skyline, was working on software that could help the Trump administration expand its immigration enforcement efforts.</p>
<p>Danny Sauter, a member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, said it was more proof that Mr. Benioff is “straying farther and farther from San Francisco values.” Mr. Sauter said that as a sanctuary city, San Francisco aims to protect undocumented immigrants who have not committed crimes, not round them up.</p>
<p>“For someone to claim that they support San Francisco and then be embedded with ICE like this is deeply concerning,” he said.</p>
<p>Scott Wiener, a Democratic state senator who represents the city, said on Thursday, “It’s completely unacceptable for any San Francisco company to help ICE scale up so that it can deploy more secret police to terrorize people in American neighborhoods.”</p>
<p>At his annual Dreamforce conference in downtown San Francisco this week, Mr. Benioff hyped the company’s “agentic enterprise,” a business model that uses A.I. agents that can help companies work more efficiently, with little human intervention.</p>
<p>At the Moscone Center, where the conference was held, it was sunshine and rainbows — literally. The décor included brightly colored cartoon characters and a man-made waterfall, and Mr. Benioff preached unity.</p>
<p>“I want to put all of our political situations aside, all of our divisiveness, and just come together as one ohana right now,” he said from the stage, using the Hawaiian word for family. (Mr. Benioff has principally lived on the Big Island of Hawaii with his actual family for the past five years.)</p>
<p>In an infomercial-style presentation from a circular stage, Mr. Benioff touted everyday uses for his A.I. agents. He talked with an executive from Williams Sonoma about how A.I. could help people plan their holiday menus and generate shopping lists, and with a leader from the jeweler Pandora about how it could help sell charm bracelets.</p>
<p>There was no mention of its applications for immigration enforcement.</p>
<p>The company’s ICE Slack channel included chatter about Salesforce employees attending a Border Security Expo in April with the hopes of meeting Tom Homan, Mr. Trump’s border czar, to “applaud him on his efforts.”</p>
<p>On Sept. 9, Salesforce staff met with Rob Thorne, the chief information security officer for ICE, and employees discussed in Slack how using A.I. to help ICE process its detainees represented a huge opportunity for Salesforce.</p>
<p>Many residents in San Francisco were aghast after Mr. Benioff said that the National Guard should be deployed there. Mr. Benioff, a fourth-generation native of the city, has long been considered a liberal benefactor compared to other tech leaders who have been more libertarian or conservative.</p>
<p>He hosted a fund-raiser for Hillary Clinton when she ran against Mr. Trump in 2016. He funded the campaign for a 2018 city ballot measure to tax businesses, including his own, to support homeless services. He canceled Salesforce travel to Indiana after the state enacted a law that allowed companies to refuse business to L.G.B.T.Q. people on religious grounds.</p>
<p>To many San Franciscans, Mr. Benioff’s politics have taken a right turn during Mr. Trump’s second term. But he said last week that he had never been progressive and that he was a longtime Republican before he switched to become an independent voter.</p>
<p>Some have blamed him for saying the National Guard should come to the city. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump reiterated that the deployment of federal troops to American cities was “just at the start” and that he wanted his administration to “start looking” at San Francisco. He also mentioned having “great support” in the city, which was seen as a reference to Mr. Benioff and Elon Musk, who backed Mr. Benioff’s call for the Guard.</p>

<p>At the Dreamforce conference, Mr. Benioff hosted David Sacks, a prominent venture capitalist now serving as Mr. Trump’s A.I. and crypto czar, for an onstage talk that centered around Mr. Sacks’s life story. Mr. Benioff said that the two were close friends and liked drinking bourbon together.</p>
<p>That night, Mr. Sacks posted on X that Mr. Benioff had been “fawning” over him and included a photo of the Salesforce executive sloppily kissing his cheek. Mr. Benioff reposted it.</p>
<p>Mr. Benioff has faced criticism for immigration-related Salesforce contracts before. In 2018, when the first Trump administration was separating families at the border, Salesforce employees and immigration activists pressured Mr. Benioff to cancel his company’s contract with U.S. Customs and Border Protection.</p>
<p>Salesforce did not cancel it, but Mr. Benioff did offer $250,000 to the Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services. Jonathan Ryan, an immigration attorney who was the center’s executive director at the time, rejected the money, calling it dirty. A Salesforce spokeswoman did not comment Thursday on the matter.</p>
<p>Mr. Ryan said in an interview this week from his home in Texas that he was not surprised that Salesforce was trying to win contracts with ICE this year. He felt that Mr. Benioff was like the vast majority of business leaders, motivated primarily by money.</p>
<p>He said that Mr. Benioff told him, in a phone call from Hawaii back in 2018, that he would visit Texas to see the family separation crisis up close.</p>
<p>He never heard from Mr. Benioff again.</p>
