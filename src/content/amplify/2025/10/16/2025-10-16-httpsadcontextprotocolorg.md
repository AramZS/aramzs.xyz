title: 'AdCP: The Open Standard for Agentic Advertising'
---
<p>From brief to buy, helping agents advertise anywhere: from CTV to chat, from tiny blog to the World Cup.</p>
<h2>Why we built AdCP</h2>
<p>The advertising ecosystem is fragmented. Every platform has its own API, its own workflow, its own reporting format. Media buyers and agencies waste countless hours navigating this complexity.</p>
<p>Each new platform requires custom integration work. APIs change, documentation varies, and maintenance never ends. Teams spend more time on plumbing than on strategy.</p>
<p>Inventory is scattered across platforms with different taxonomies and targeting options. Finding the right audiences means learning multiple systems and manually comparing options.</p>
<p>AI agents and automation tools can't easily interact with advertising platforms. Each integration is bespoke, limiting the potential of AI-powered workflows.</p>
<p><strong>We believe there's a better way.</strong> A single protocol that any platform can implement and any tool can use. An open standard that makes advertising technology work together, not against each other.</p>
<h2>Founding Members</h2>
<p>AdCP is supported by leading advertising technology companies committed to open standards</p>
