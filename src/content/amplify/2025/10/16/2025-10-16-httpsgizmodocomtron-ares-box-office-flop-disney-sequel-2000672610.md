<p>Jared Leto may have gotten the Grid shut down for good.</p>
<p>A new report from <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/jared-leto-tron-ares-box-office-1236401068/">THR</a> alleges that Disney is considering the nuclear option for the <em>Tron</em> franchise in the wake of <em>Tron: Ares</em>‘ <a href="https://gizmodo.com/tron-ares-spoilers-burning-questions-legacy-2000670394">struggling box office performance</a>. The latest movie in the franchise opened last weekend to a $33.2 million domestic opening and only brought in around $60.2 million in total. As a point of comparison, Leto’s last high-profile flop, <a href="https://gizmodo.com/morbius-review-jared-leto-matt-smith-sony-spider-man-ma-1848728601">the critically maligned</a> Sony Spider-Man spinoff vehicle <em>Morbius</em>, opened to $39 million in 2022 before going on to bring in<a href="https://gizmodo.com/morbius-theatrical-return-flops-spider-man-sony-marvel-1849020942"> just $167 million worldwide</a>.</p>

<p>Now, according to the trade’s sources, it appears that <em>Tron</em> in general will “likely retire from the big screen.”</p>
<p>The franchise has never had the most stellar record at the box office, which is in part the reason why it took 28 years to see <a href="https://gizmodo.com/tron-legacy-retro-review-tron-ares-jeff-bridges-disney-1851282804"><em>Tron: Legacy</em> hit screens</a>—and why even its own $400 million box office taking wasn’t deemed worthy enough to warrant a sequel for another 15 years. But for all the lingering controversies around <a href="https://gizmodo.com/jared-leto-tron-ares-method-acting-disney-2000665912">its eclectic lead actor</a>, it was Leto himself who played a major part in <em>Tron: Ares</em> happening at all.</p>
<p>Disney was in development on a new <em>Tron</em> movie as early as October 2010, with plans to create a direct sequel to the premise and characters introduced in <em>Legacy</em>. The <a href="https://gizmodo.com/a-brief-history-of-tron-3-not-happening-1844297693">project remained in limbo</a> until 2015, when Disney officially greenlit a <em>Legacy</em> sequel, only to be dramatically scrapped by the studio months later. Leto spearheaded attempts to revive a soft reboot of the series, pushing plans to elevate the Ares character included <a href="https://gizmodo.com/tron-ares-spoilers-writer-interview-disney-2000670050">in earlier drafts</a> into a starring role for himself. By 2017, Leto was on board to both produce and star in the new project, culminating in the <em>Tron: Ares</em> we now see on screen, for better or worse.</p>
<p>But for all of Leto’s efforts—and it’s clear he is not the sole reason that <em>Ares</em> has <a href="https://gizmodo.com/tron-ares-movies-review-jared-leto-greta-lee-nin-2000668540">failed to click</a> with a significant chunk of critics and audiences alike—they may have only served to send <em>Tron</em> offline for good. He’s not done with genre roles any time soon though, considering he’s <a href="https://gizmodo.com/jared-leto-he-man-movie-skeletor-2000542065">set to play Skeletor</a> in the upcoming <em>Masters of the Universe</em> movie, but perhaps the days of the actor driving a product like <em>Ares</em> to fruition may be as over as the <em>Tron</em> franchise itself might be.</p>
<p>That’s the thing about <em>Tron</em> though: people have waited <em>very</em> long times to get more of it. The Grid might have the plug pulled for now, but it wouldn’t be that surprising to see someone else take a crack at rebooting it back to life in another decade or two.</p>
