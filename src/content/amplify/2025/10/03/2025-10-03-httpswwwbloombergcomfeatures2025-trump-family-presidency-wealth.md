<p>The Trump Family’s Money-Making Machine</p>

<p>The way Donald Trump sees it, he’s the greatest businessman to campaign for the White House.</p>
<p>“I’m the most successful person ever to run,” he told an Iowa reporter in 2015. “I have a Gucci store that’s worth more than Romney.”</p>
<p>That might have been an exaggeration, but this isn’t: A decade later, no modern American president has positioned his family to make so much money while in the White House. Already, since the early days of his reelection campaign, he’s more than doubled his net worth to <a data-terminal="BIO 1252249" data-terminal-type="PEOPLE" data-terminal-value="1252249">about $5.4 billion</a>.</p>
<p>In that time, the Trump name has powered more than $10 billion of real estate projects, a multibillion-dollar valuation for his money-losing social-media company, more than $500 million in sales from just one of his crypto ventures and millions of dollars more from stakes in companies that offer financial services, guns and drone parts. Family members have also scored an array of corporate positions — at least seven new roles as an adviser or executive for his oldest son, Donald Trump Jr., alone.</p>
<p>Compared with the <a data-terminal="NSN SVLDWQDWLU68" data-terminal-type="STORY" data-terminal-value="SVLDWQDWLU68" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-05-01/100-wild-moments-from-trump-s-first-100-days-you-probably-missed">tumult</a> of the presidency, the empire’s approach is consistent and clear: Sell the family name. In any other era, this scale of presidential moneymaking would threaten to be the story of the year, but political uproar has hogged most of the attention.</p>
<p>In his first months in power, Trump put tariffs on and took some off, blamed Ukraine for Russia’s attacks, sent immigrants to a foreign prison and teased a third term that the Constitution doesn’t allow. And as he’s hacked away at the government’s workforce and budget, he’s shrunk the agencies and offices that oversee his public company, crypto projects and even conflicts of interest.</p>
<p>Trump has loosened constraints on overseas dealmaking that were put in place in his last administration. (He also let Elon Musk, the billionaire leading an effort to slash government spending, police his own conflicts). This week, he’s scheduled to dine with his new memecoin’s top <a data-terminal="NSN SVVW6BT1UM0W" data-terminal-type="STORY" data-terminal-value="SVVW6BT1UM0W" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2025-trump-memecoin-foreign-crypto-traders/">holders</a>.</p>
<p>What makes this era even more remarkable is how close Trump came to ruin. His first term ended with a riot at the Capitol, later followed by a $454 million civil fraud judgment and his conviction for falsifying business records. Trump has appealed both.</p>
<p>Now, his assets are in a trust overseen by his oldest son. And despite talk of a recession, the clan stands to get richer than ever.</p>
<p>“President Trump has been the most transparent president in history in all respects, including when it comes to his finances,” said a White House spokesperson. “President Trump handed over his multibillion-dollar empire in order to serve our country, and he has sacrificed greatly. President Trump has disclosed his financial holdings through his annual financial disclosure report and he will continue to do so.”</p>
<p>Trump Jr. said he shouldn’t be expected to change his career on account of his dad’s power.</p>
<p>“I’m a private citizen who has been a businessman and serial investor my entire adult life,” he said in a statement. “It’s ridiculous to expect me to stop doing what I’ve always done to provide for my five children just because my dad was elected president.”</p>
<p>These are the corporate connections, crypto projects and licensing deals — all of them since the 2024 campaign began — that the Trumps are using to climb higher than ever.</p>

<p>This term is different than the president’s first, when his plan to address conflicts of interest hinged on putting his assets in a trust overseen by his two oldest sons and agreeing not to pursue any new foreign deals. This time, what’s off limits are new deals with other governments. That leaves the door open for other opportunities. These real estate developments often involve licensing the Trump name for glitzy hotels and residences, including in the three Middle Eastern countries the president visited this month. Two projects link the Trump Organization to government arms of Oman and Qatar.</p>

The development, which includes a hotel, golf course and residences, puts the president’s family into a business partnership with a US ally. Trump International Oman calls itself “the ultimate power move” built “for those who invest to win.” The project, developed by Dar Global, the international arm of Saudi real estate giant Dar Al Arkan, in partnership with Oman’s state-owned tourism group, advertises “hands-off investment expertly managed by Trump while you generate income passively,” along with a lifetime residency visa for investors. Trump Jr. and Eric Trump were seen smiling at a launch event in June, where the “power move” slogan was displayed in big letters. In the meantime, Oman has been playing a central role in high-stakes nuclear negotiations with Iran.</p>

Within months, a project unveiled in gas-rich Qatar seemed to test the boundaries of that pledge. Qatari Diar Real Estate Investment, established by the country’s sovereign wealth fund, said it’s teaming up with Dar Global to develop a Trump-branded golf club and villas inside a new tourism development that’s set to be bigger than Walt Disney Co.’s Magic Kingdom. In his first term, Trump said Qatar had a history of funding terrorism. In May, it offered him a luxury jet to serve as Air Force One.</p>

And in Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Noida and Mumbai, a city that already has a Trump Tower, more developments are in the works. On most of those projects the family is working with India’s Tribeca Developers, whose founder, Kalpesh Mehta, met Trump Jr. through a mutual contact at Wharton, according to a local report.</p>

<p>Hung Yen, Vietnam Before his father’s second term began, Eric Trump said that anyone looking to curry favor with the president through the Trump Organization would be “coming to the wrong guy.” The Communist Party of Vietnam may see it differently. While Trump was campaigning, the company announced a deal to build a $1.5 billion complex of hotels, golf courses and luxury homes in the northern province of Hung Yen. A post on the province’s website said that the Trump Organization’s work will help with “enhancing Vietnam’s image in the international arena and in relations with the US government.” In September, one high-ranking official stopped by to watch a signing ceremony for the deal, and Trump himself attended a meeting between his son Eric and Dang Thanh Tam, chairman of project developer Kinh Bac City. In March, Vietnam’s prime minister hosted Trump partner Charles Boyd-Bowman, the head of investment firm IDG Capital Vietnam, who said that authorities were helping speed up progress, according to the article on the government website. The Trumps are considering a new tower in the country, too, according to reports from the region.</p>

<p>Sazan Island, Albania  Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and former top adviser, has turned to endeavors outside the White House. He wants to make a $1.4 billion Aman-branded luxury resort out of an old military base on a rocky island of decaying buildings and bunkers off the Albanian coast. A committee chaired by Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama gave preliminary approval for Kushner’s development on Sazan Island in the lead-up to Trump’s inauguration.

Most of the money Kushner has raised for his fund comes from Gulf states and investors, including Saudi and Qatari funds. He has said his firm “preemptively tried to avoid any conflicts, so we don’t have to raise capital for the next four years.”</p>

Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic said he “died laughing” when he read that he was thought to be using the project to influence Trump, according to the New York Times. Soon after, thousands of protesters gathered to commemorate the bombing’s victims and oppose the project. Kushner and Emirati billionaire Mohamed Alabbar plan to start sales this year.

In the weeks before his inauguration, he got two pieces of good news. First, Saudi-backed LIV Golf scheduled a tournament for April, following others from past years. Days later, the city council approved the Trump family’s plans to build 20-story condo towers on the property, likely boosting its value.

<p>Only four years ago, Trump called Bitcoin a scam. Now he’s a crypto booster who’s advertising an array of digital offerings with his name on them, and crypto executives and companies who donated millions to his White House return are hoping to shape policy. Trump’s inauguration weekend featured a black-tie crypto ball, he convened cabinet members and “high-IQ people” for a first-of-its-kind crypto summit at the White House, he set up a national stockpile of Bitcoin and he anointed a “crypto czar.” At the same time, the price of virtual currencies impacts the Trump fortune. He has his own memecoin, he promotes a crypto platform co-founded by one of his most senior envoys, and his social media company has announced plans to sell crypto-based investments. These are the Trump family businesses poised to profit as he turns America into “the crypto capital of the planet.”</p>

But it’s the Trump family that gets about 75% of certain net revenue. A company spokesman said it isn’t political, its executives aren’t public officials, there’s no conflict of interest and Witkoff “has been actively divesting his assets.” He called Sun an early supporter and said any suggestion that an association with World Liberty would result in preferential government treatment would be absurd.</p>

<p>Delaware Because memecoins tend to have no practical purpose except making money from attention — these volatile and waggish cryptocurrencies essentially lack concrete underlying assets by design — they make sense for a former reality star. Even so, Democratic officials and even crypto veterans have criticized the coins that Trump and his wife unveiled just before the inauguration. His coin had lost most of its peak value by the time he announced, in April, a private dinner for its top holders, many of whom used foreign exchanges in a sign they’re based overseas. Senator Chris Murphy, a Democrat, called it “the most brazenly corrupt thing a president has ever done.” (A White House spokesperson has said Trump abides by conflict-of-interest laws.) Previously, regulators had been mulling whether memecoins should be considered securities, which would invite stricter rules. About a month after the $TRUMP and $MELANIA coins debuted, the SEC weighed in: No, memecoins aren’t securities, but rather “akin to collectibles” and policed accordingly.</p>

<p>Miami, Florida The relationships between this Bitcoin miner, the Trump family and a new strategic venture are labyrinthine. After the inauguration, the president’s two oldest sons helped create American Data Centers, working with Dominari, the Trump Tower-headquartered investment bank where the Trump scions had just become advisers. Eric Trump called the new data venture “crucial for the development of AI infrastructure,” even though it hadn’t done much of anything yet. About a month later, the fledgling company reached a deal that gave a majority stake to Bitcoin mining firm Hut 8. The Trump brothers and their partners have a 20% stake in the joint venture, now called American Bitcoin. It plans to go public this year.</p>

<p>Palm Beach, Florida Less than a week after his father was reelected, Trump Jr. became a partner at 1789 Capital. With co-founders including former Bank of America executive Omeed Malik, Republican mega-donor Rebekah Mercer and investor Chris Buskirk, the firm monetizes the president’s vision for US culture by taking stakes in startups with a MAGA bent. As President Trump seeks to dismantle government and corporate programs promoting equity and inclusion, 1789 is tending to investments such as the Enhanced Games (nicknamed the “steroid Olympics”) and Polymarket, a crypto-based prediction site. “1789 Capital is funding the next era of American prosperity through its core principles of entrepreneurship, innovation and growth,” a spokesperson said.

<p>Orlando, Florida Soon after the election, the maker of drone components announced that Trump Jr. was joining as an adviser. Its stock soared just shy of 250% in the two trading days that followed. He held more than 300,000 shares, according to a filing in November, when they were worth more than $3 million. Stakes including his were registered for potential sale, but as of early May it wasn’t clear whether he’d sold.</p>

<p>West Palm Beach, Florida PSQ, or PublicSquare, runs a marketplace for what it calls anti-woke products, including pro-life diaper brand EveryLife, and features a buy-now, pay-later system for firearms. The company has lost more than $100 million over the past two years, but when Trump Jr. — already an adviser — joined the board in early December shares of the retailer leaped 270%. Last year, the company awarded him more than $3.1 million, and his 1789 partner Malik is a top shareholder, regulatory filings show. Trump Jr. is “an incredible businessman, strategic partner and marketing expert,” who has advised the company since 2022, PublicSquare CEO Michael Seifert said. He added that revenue is up and that President Trump “is operating fairly and impartially.”</p>

But in February, its shares spiked more than 80% in the hours after it announced that the two older Trump sons were joining the advisory board. (The stock also rose just before the news was publicized). They are both top shareholders, with stakes worth more than $17 million combined, according to an April filing that listed most of their stock for potential sale. No adviser has sold shares and the firm remains committed to “its long-term growth strategy,” a Dominari spokesperson said this month.

The company fought commodities regulators in court for more than a year to be able to let users wager on vote outcomes last November. When Trump Jr. joined the private company as a strategic adviser, he said his family used it “to know we won hours ahead of the fake news media.” A company spokesperson said employees and advisers are banned from trading on its markets and that Trump Jr. has played no role in any legal or regulatory proceedings.</p>

<p>A social-media company that went public just last year now accounts for the majority of Trump’s wealth, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. His family also stands to profit from a grab bag of new endeavors that defy easy categorization, including the launch of a private members-only club in Georgetown, lawsuits settled just as Trump returned to the White House and a Melania Trump documentary. The jumble of new opportunities underscores the family’s willingness to find new ways to bring in cash from its name and brand, extending past anything it did during Trump’s first term.</p>

<p>Sarasota, Florida Trump’s $2.9 billion stake in his namesake social media startup, which went public while he was campaigning last year, makes up most of his fortune. He might not even make the list of the world’s richest people without Truth Social’s parent company, which trades like a meme stock — shares are up since September even though it reported a net loss of about $401 million last year. After Trump’s inauguration, the company moved into finance with products poised to benefit directly from Trump’s own policies, including “Made in America” funds, in time for his steep tariffs and an embrace of digital assets as he loosens curbs on them. In March, three days after Trump Media announced a partnership with Crypto.com, that Singapore-based firm said the US Securities and Exchange Commission closed an investigation with no enforcement action. Trump, whose stake is in the trust, continues as president to publish on the platform, where posts are called “truths.”</p>

Meta, Facebook’s parent, said it would contribute $22 million to his presidential library to end a lawsuit that claimed he was illegally banned from its social networks after the 2021 Capitol riot. ABC News, owned by Disney, agreed in December to pay $15 million toward his presidential foundation or museum to end a suit claiming one of its anchors defamed him.
