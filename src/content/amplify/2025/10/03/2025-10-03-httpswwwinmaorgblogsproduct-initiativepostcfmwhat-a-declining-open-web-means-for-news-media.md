  Here’s what a leaked Google document about its anti-trust cases says about the
  decline of the open Web and what that means for news publisher strategy.

title: What a declining open Web means for news media
---
<p>The subject of an e-mail chain that went around the INMA initiative leads this week was: “It’s official — open Web is in rapid decline. Google says so.”</p>
<p>This was clearly tongue in cheek. Documents leaked from Google’s anti-trust cases that showed their argument. And we had a field day arguing all sides of it. The <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.vaed.533508/gov.uscourts.vaed.533508.1664.0.pdf?ref=platformer.news">full filing is here</a> for those who want to read it.</p>

<p>My initial response was this: It’s exactly what we’ve been saying for a year or so — the Web is in decline. We don’t know how quickly, but this transformation is huge and it’s already started.</p>
<p>One of my colleagues disagrees (and had the data to prove it), but we need to break it down into past data and what we know is coming.</p>
<p>Firstly, the Google argument:</p>
<p>They are arguing the open Web is in significant decline, mostly due to other companies, so how could they possibly be a monopoly (Hard Fork podcast argues this well). And it’s fair to say the argument made by Google is self-serving, but it doesn’t mean they are wrong.</p>
<p>The question is whether the debate is really about advertising (as my colleague Gabriel is likely to cover in the advertising initiative <a href="https://www.inma.org/blogs/advertising-initiative/">here</a>) or search, discovery, and consumer behaviour. I will focus on the latter.</p>
<p>At our recent <a href="https://www.inma.org/modules/event/2025NapaRoundtable/index.html">CEO Roundtable</a>, many people told us ChatGPT had replaced search for them. Answer engines are certainly a go-to for many people. I noticed that in the Comet browser, consumers have the option to use Perplexity or Google. We see this across a number of places now.</p>
<p>The fact is: There is a viable alternative and people are starting to use it.</p>
<figure><img alt="The Comet browser gives users the option of using Perplexity or Google." src="https://www.inma.org/blogs/product-and-tech/assets/content/Product_SEP25_Jodie_Open_Web-760-3.jpg"/><figcaption>The Comet browser gives users the option of using Perplexity or Google.</figcaption></figure>
<p>However if we look at “time spent,” panel data suggests time outside the top walled gardens hasn’t fallen off a cliff and, in some cuts, has grown since 2017. The decline is relative power and control, not instantaneous disappearance.</p>
<p>For news publishers, relative decline is what changes strategy.</p>
<p>Why this still adds up to a “post-traffic era”:</p>
<ul><li><p>Answer engines &amp; AI browsers (plus Meta/TikTok/Amazon ecosystems) are siphoning intent and habit from the open Web. Less referral, more in-stream answers. That erodes the economic engine that made “free content + advertising” work. This is going to be a tough, if not impossible, business model within a few years. </p></li><li><p>Attribution opacity increases. Brand recall decays when content is consumed as an answer, not a destination. This is a serious challenge for news organisations and one we need to spend time thinking about. </p></li><li><p>Adtech concentration means the incremental efficiency gains accrue to platforms faster than to independent sites. This will be the same with commerce.</p></li></ul>
<p>So, no the open Web isn’t dead (yet). But the business model is starting to look that way. And no business viability makes it fragile in the long term.</p>
<p><strong>What publishers should do next (and what we’ve been advising at INMA):</strong></p>
<ul><li><strong>Shift from traffic to customers.</strong> Re-anchor KPIs from UPVs/time-on-site to propensity, habit, LTV, and segment health. Kill vanity metrics.</li><li><strong>Strengthen direct relationships.</strong> Logged-in users, newsletters, apps, memberships, communities — anything that builds repeatable touchpoints that you own.

<ul><li><p><strong>Diversify revenue.</strong> Subscriptions, B2B/licensing, events, education, premium utilities (crosswords, games), commerce with clear editorial guardrails.</p></li><li><p><strong>Invest in first-party data and consent UX.</strong> Treat identity and preference data like crown jewels. Make value exchange obvious and fair. </p></li><li><p><strong>Consider your move from SEO to “AEO” (Answer Engine Optimisation):</strong> Understand whether you want to appear in LLMs and, if so, how you package all or some of your content (structured summaries, provenance, freshness, entity clarity) while defending brand credit.</p></li><li><p><strong>Negotiate from strength.</strong> Explore licensing and APIs with AI platforms — but set red lines: attribution, logs, usage bounds, and a real economic model. Use scraper measurement and blockers; <a href="https://www.inma.org/blogs/product-initiative/post.cfm/4-step-framework-can-help-news-companies-navigate-ai-scraper-bots">more on that from INMA here</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Reduce programmatic dependence.</strong> Tilt toward direct, programmatic-guaranteed, and high-attention formats that prove outcomes for advertisers.</p></li><li><p><strong>Ship product improvements continuously.</strong> Frictionless onboarding, simplified offers, value-forward paywalls, and habit loops (alerts, streaks, utility).</p></li></ul>
<p>Nuances to remember:</p>
<ul><li><p>Usage beyond walled gardens can be stable while economic leverage migrates to aggregators and AI interfaces.</p></li><li><p>The pace is uncertain, but the direction isn’t. The cliff isn’t tomorrow, but it is real. AI browsers are only going to speed this up, and now <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/ai-innovations/">Google is in that race, too</a>. Strategy should reflect compounding effects already visible in referral, search behaviours, and ad dispersion.</p></li><li><p>Context matters. Some premium brands will hold pricing power, the long tail may well feel the squeeze first.</p></li></ul>
<p>The open Web hasn’t flatlined. But as a stand-alone engine for journalism that is often funded by programmatic, it’s almost certainly past its peak. We’re in the post-traffic era, which means focus is needed on owned relationships, durable value, and product excellence. The companies that act now will control their destiny when the answer — not the clicks — become the default.</p>
