title: Scrape the web for OpenAI — with the Atlas browser!
---
<p>OpenAI has finally released its web browser project, Atlas! It’s Chrome with ChatGPT being an agent for you. [<a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-atlas/"><i>OpenAI</i></a>]</p>
<p>So what’s it like to use? Anil Dash tried it out. Dash calls it the anti web browser — “the first browser that actively fights against the web.” He opened it, typed “Taylor Swift Showgirls” into the search bar, and got back a web page! One written by the chatbot: [<a href="https://www.anildash.com/2025/10/22/atlas-anti-web-browser/"><i>blog post</i></a>]</p>
<blockquote><p>I had typed “Taylor Swift” in a browser, and the response had literally zero links to Taylor Swift’s actual website. If you stayed within what Atlas generated, you would have no way of knowing that Taylor Swift has a website at all.</p></blockquote>
<p>Imagine if all web pages were <a href="https://pivot-to-ai.com/2025/07/24/nobody-clicks-past-googles-ai-overviews/">Google AI Overview</a> summaries</p>
<p>Atlas is also your agentic pal who’s fun to be with! This is the hot new thing in web browsers — get it to do stuff on the web for you!</p>
<p>And hope the hallucinations won’t lead it wildly astray. And that it won’t be prompt-injected by <a href="https://pivot-to-ai.com/2025/08/25/perplexitys-ai-browser-comet-can-be-prompt-injected-by-any-website/">something it reads on a web page</a>. As happens with <i>all</i> the agentic web browsers. Because large language models cannot tell data from instructions. Atlas has been prompt-injected already. [<em><a href="https://x.com/wunderwuzzi23/status/1980811307797659827">Twitter</a>; <a href="https://x.com/Patrosi73/status/1981772098025533802/photo/1">Twitter</a></em>]</p>
<p>Letting a chatbot do things always ends like this. If agent browsers gain any popularity, they’ll be a security disaster.</p>
<p>But there’s one really obvious reason for OpenAI to release Atlas — so it can get past all the sites blocking their bots from scraping them for training.</p>
<p>Nobody who runs a site wants to talk to the scrapers any more. The bots have gotten feisty lately and they’re getting past the blocking.</p>
<p>And then there’s all the paywalled data and the personal data and the corporate data. Think if they could train on all that juicy stuff!</p>
<p>OpenAI swears training is strictly opt-out, but they’d really love you to enable it.</p>
<p>At present, there’s no quick way to block Atlas — its user agent is identical to the version of Chrome it’s based on. Though Gergely Nagy from Iocaine is working on detecting Atlas: [<a href="https://come-from.mad-scientist.club/@algernon/statuses/01K8AR3MAVAD8YHZHKY8MXKRF4"><i>post</i></a>]</p>
<blockquote><p>Once I can confirm that the method works outside of the short experiment I was able to conduct, I’ll make it public, so other tools can follow along and send Atlas to the garbage bin where it belongs. It will not be able to run rampant for long.</p></blockquote>
