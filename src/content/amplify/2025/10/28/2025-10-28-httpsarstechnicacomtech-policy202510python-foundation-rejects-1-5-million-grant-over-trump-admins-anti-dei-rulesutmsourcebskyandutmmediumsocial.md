<figure></figure><figure></figure><p>The Python Software Foundation has rejected a $1.5 million government grant because of anti-DEI requirements imposed by the Trump administration, the nonprofit said in a <a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2025/10/NSF-funding-statement.html">blog post</a> yesterday. The grant would have been the largest in the organization’s history.</p>
<p>Hoping to “address structural vulnerabilities in Python and PyPI,” the foundation submitted a grant proposal in January 2025 to the National Science Foundation’s Safety, Security, and Privacy of Open Source Ecosystems <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/safe-ose-safety-security-privacy-open-source-ecosystems">program</a>. After a “multi-round proposal writing process” and a “months-long vetting process,” it appeared the foundation was close to obtaining a two-year grant worth $1.5 million.</p>
<p>But what at first seemed like good news quickly turned sour due to rules against Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion programs, the foundation said:</p>
<blockquote><p>We were honored when, after many months of work, our proposal was recommended for funding, particularly as only <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/funding/overview">36%</a> of new NSF grant applicants are successful on their first attempt. We became concerned, however, when we were presented with the terms and conditions we would be required to agree to if we accepted the grant. These terms included affirming the statement that we “do not, and will not during the term of this financial assistance award, operate any programs that advance or promote DEI, or discriminatory equity ideology in violation of Federal anti-discrimination laws.” This restriction would apply not only to the security work directly funded by the grant, <strong>but to any and all activity of the PSF as a whole</strong>. Further, violation of this term gave the NSF the right to “claw back” previously approved and transferred funds. This would create a situation where money we’d already spent could be taken back, which would be an enormous, open-ended financial risk.</p></blockquote>
<p>With its annual budget of $5 million and a staff of 14 people, the Python Software Foundation said a $1.5 million grant “would have been quite a lot of money for us, and easily the largest grant we’d ever received.” But the foundation’s <a href="https://www.python.org/psf/mission/">mission statement</a> includes a goal “to support and facilitate the growth of a diverse and international community of Python programmers,” which conflicted with the grant requirements.</p>
<p>“Given the value of the grant to the community and the PSF, we did our utmost to get clarity on the terms and to find a way to move forward in concert with our values. We consulted our NSF contacts and reviewed decisions made by other organizations in similar circumstances, particularly The Carpentries,” the Python Software Foundation said.</p>
<h2>Board voted unanimously to withdraw application</h2>
<p>The Carpentries, which teaches computational and data science skills to researchers, <a href="https://carpentries.org/blog/2025/06/announcing-withdrawal-of-nsf-pose-proposal/">said in June</a> that it withdrew its grant proposal after “we were notified that our proposal was flagged for DEI content, namely, for ‘the retention of underrepresented students, which has a limitation or preference in outreach, recruitment, participation that is not aligned to NSF priorities.’” The Carpentries was also concerned about the National Science Foundation rule against grant recipients advancing or promoting DEI in “any” program, a change that <a href="https://nsf-gov-resources.nsf.gov/files/gc1-may25.pdf">took effect in May</a>.</p>
<p>“These new requirements mean that, in order to accept NSF funds, we would need to agree to discontinue all DEI focused programming, even if those activities are not carried out with NSF funds,” The Carpentries’ announcement in June said, explaining the decision to rescind the proposal.</p>
<p>The Python Software Foundation similarly decided that it “can’t agree to a statement that we won’t operate any programs that ‘advance or promote’ diversity, equity, and inclusion, as it would be a betrayal of our mission and our community,” it said yesterday. The foundation board “voted unanimously to withdraw” the application.</p>
<p>The Python foundation said it is disappointed because the project would have offered “invaluable advances to the Python and greater open source community, protecting millions of PyPI users from attempted supply-chain attacks.” The plan was to “create new tools for automated proactive review of all packages uploaded to PyPI, rather than the current process of reactive-only review. These novel tools would rely on capability analysis, designed based on a dataset of known malware. Beyond just protecting PyPI users, the outputs of this work could be transferable for all open source software package registries, such as NPM and Crates.io, improving security across multiple open source ecosystems.”</p>
<p>The foundation is still hoping to do that work and ended its blog post with a call for donations from individuals and companies that use Python.</p>
