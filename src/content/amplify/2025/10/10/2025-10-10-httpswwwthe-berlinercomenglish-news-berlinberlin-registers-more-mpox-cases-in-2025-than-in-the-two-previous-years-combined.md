<h3>Berlin registers more MPox cases in 2025 than in the two previous years combined</h3>
<p>According to the latest weekly report from the State Office for Health and Social Affairs, Berlin has registered 160 cases of Mpox. In 2024, there were 68 cases of registered infections and 87 cases in 2023. This means that by October 2025, Berlin has already recorded more cases than in the previous two years combined. According to the State Office, new infections have declined since July, with an average of zero to four new cases each week. However, last week the office recorded a spike with nine new cases, all of which were men between the ages of 20 and 60 and five of whom were vaccinated already.</p>
<p>Mpox is a viral infection, and vaccinations are available. Two jabs are required for full immunisation. The virus is transmitted through close physical contact, such as sex, and has an incubation period of five to 21 days. The virus typically progresses in two stages. The first stage is accompanied by fever, severe headaches, fatigue and muscle and back pain. The second stage is a characteristic rash that appears after one to three days. Spots, which eventually turn into fluid-filled pustules, can occur on the face, palms, soles of the feet and also in the genital and anal areas. They tend to be very itchy and painful and usually dissipate after four weeks, with most adults having a mild to moderate progression.</p>
<p>Until 2022, Mpox was mostly prevalent in West and Central Africa, however in May 2022, a new variant spread persistently from person to person and arrived in Europe by the summer. Infections declined significantly after preventative measures, but have been on the rise again since 2023, with the WHO announcing an international health emergency due to a new, even more contagious variant.</p>
