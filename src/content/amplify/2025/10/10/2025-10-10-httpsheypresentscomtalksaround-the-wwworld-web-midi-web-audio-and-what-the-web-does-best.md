  So, you don't use the Web Audio and Web MIDI APIs in your day job - does that
  mean they have nothing important to tell us about the nature of the Web? Think
  again! Katie Fenn takes us on a tour of the Web Audio and Web MIDI APIs by
  creatively-coding Daft Punk's 1997 classic, "Around the World". The talk will
  reflect on what the Web is good at, and the enduring value of unlicensed
  standards.
