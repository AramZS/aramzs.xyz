<p>Comedians looking to donate their fee from the <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/riyadh-comedy-festival-saudi-arabia-whos-going.html">Riyadh Comedy Festival</a>, look elsewhere. A spokesperson for Human Rights Watch told <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/human-rights-watch-refuses-aziz-ansari-riyadh-donation-1236544862/"><em>Variety</em></a> it “cannot accept” money from comedians who have “generously offered to donate part of their performance fees.” According to Arvind Ganesan, Human Rights Watch’s head of economic justice and rights division, taking money from people who took money from the government of Saudi Arabia could “create the perception that somehow we compromised our independence after the fact.”</p>
<p>But whose money is Human Rights Watch unable to accept? Definitely Aziz Ansari’s, who said on <a href="https://youtu.be/3JQUUNFGgls?si=bOaNXgCt3Q5MgDki"><em>Jimmy Kimmel Live!</em></a> that he’d be donating part of his appearance fee to the org (alongside Reporters Without Borders). And maybe Jessica Kirson’s, who said she’d donate all her fee to a human rights org, but never said which one.</p>
<p>HRW’s Saudi Arabia researcher Joey Shea said that, while they can’t take the comics’ money, “it is not too late for them to call for the release of detained Saudi activists.” It is similar to what Shea said before the festival, urging performers to “use this high-profile opportunity to call for the release of detained Saudi activists.”</p>
