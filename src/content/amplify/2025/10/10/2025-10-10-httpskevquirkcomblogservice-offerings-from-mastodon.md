title: Service Offerings from Mastodon

<p>Mastodon’s started offering paid hosting and support for institutions that want their own corner of the fediverse. They’re already working with the EU and a few local governments. It’s a sensible move that keeps things sustainable without selling out the decentralised idea.</p>
<p>I think this is a great move by the Mastodon team - so many instances are supported by their members through donations. As I understand it, a large part of Mastodon’s funding comes from <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/sponsors">donations and sponsors</a> too.</p>
<p>By diversifying their income streams, we will hopefully see Mastodon here for the long-term, and (more importantly) not selling out to <em>big tech</em> as they will be able to stand on their own two feet.</p>
<p>…Mozilla, take note. You sausages.</p>
