<p>Campus, a college startup backed by <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/23/sam-altman-openais-850-billion-in-planned-buildouts-bubble-concern.html">Sam Altman</a>, has hired <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/META/">Meta</a>’s former AI Vice President Jerome Pesenti as its technology head, the company announced Friday.</p>
<p>As part of the deal, Campus will buy Pesenti’s <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/ai-effect/">artificial intelligence</a> learning platform Sizzle AI for an undisclosed amount and integrate its personalized AI-generated educational content already used by 1.7 million people.</p>
<p>The acquisition advances the company’s “roadmap” by two to three years and helps the platform cater learning toward individual student needs, said Tade Oyerinde, Campus founder and chancellor.</p>
<p>“This is a game changer,” he told CNBC.</p>
<p>Campus was founded to disrupt the community college system by “maximizing access to world-class education,” according to its website. It offers accredited associate degrees taught by adjunct professors from the likes of Stanford, Princeton and New York University.</p>
<p>The platform has over 3,000 enrolled students, charges $7,320 per academic year and accepts Pell Grants, <a href="https://campus.edu/about">according to its website</a>. It also provides attendees with a laptop, mobile Wi-Fi pack, personal success coach and 24/7 tutoring access. Professors make upwards of $8,000 per course.</p>
<p>Campus has raised over $100 million from the likes of Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund, General Catalyst, NBA star Shaquille O’Neal, venture capitalist and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/PLTR/">Palantir</a> co-founder Joe Lonsdale and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/FIG/">Figma</a> CEO Dylan Field.</p>
