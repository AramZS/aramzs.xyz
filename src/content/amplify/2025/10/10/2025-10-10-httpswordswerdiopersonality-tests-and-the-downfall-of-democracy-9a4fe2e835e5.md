<h2 data-selectable-paragraph="">In 2001, I found a way to make personality tests go viral. In 2016, they were used to swing an election.</h2>

<h2 data-selectable-paragraph="">1. Trolling for fun and profit</h2>
<p>Seventeen years ago, weblogs and social networks — what we’d eventually know as <em>social media</em> — were beginning to emerge. Giving everybody the ability to publish was still revolutionary, but not everybody was ready to create their own content from scratch. Writing a whole blog post, or uploading an original photo, was a high barrier to entry: an article could take hours or days, and not everybody had the skills or technology to take a beautiful digital photograph.</p>
<p>Memes were a neat solution: you clicked a few buttons, and suddenly had customized content to share on your blog. Correspondingly, weblogs began to fill up with dumb <em>Cosmopolitan</em>-style personality tests: <em>What kind of girlfriend are you? Which Care Bear are you?</em> Infuriated by the banality, I created a sort of parody, <em>Which horrible affliction are you?</em>, that deliberately trolled the blogosphere by allowing bloggers to declare themselves to be rickets or plague — and almost instantly became the most shared content online. <a href="https://words.werd.io/we-are-the-monkeys-of-rum-70f81d4a02df">I told the whole story in <em>We Are the Monkeys of Rum</em></a>.</p>
<p>My content was more viral for two reasons:</p>
<ol><li data-selectable-paragraph="">People really did prefer to post pre-made content than go through the time and effort of creating their own.</li><li data-selectable-paragraph="">I trolled hard. A potential answer in <em>Which evil criminal are you?</em> was President Truman for dropping the atomic bomb. The resulting, often outrage-driven, conversation across blogs and Livejournal helped spread my links better than the content itself.</li></ol>
<p>Over time, social media switched to concentrate on Twitter and Facebook, and my own interest waned in favor of other projects. The site was sold for a modest sum and we all moved on with our lives. Today, I support media startups that have the potential to create a more informed, inclusive, and empathetic society through <a href="https://matter.vc">Matter</a>.</p>
<p>In particular, because modern social networks didn’t allow you to post HTML, building an adequate sharing mechanism for personality tests became more complicated. For real customization, you would probably need to actually build a Facebook integration, forcing users to authenticate and share their information.</p>
<p>We could see which sites (and therefore which people) were sharing our content; we could see how it was being discovered; we could know where in the world those people were. But by authenticating and adding a Facebook identity to each user, developers could learn a whole lot more.</p>
<h2 data-selectable-paragraph="">2. Rise of the viral information scrapers</h2>
<p>Last year, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/07/the-internet-is-one-big-personality-test/531861/">the Atlantic reported on Cambridge Analytica’s use of personality tests to gather intimate personal information</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p data-selectable-paragraph="">Facebook newsfeeds are filled with <em>BuzzFeed </em>quizzes and other oddball questionnaires that tell you <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/ashleyperez/what-city-should-you-actually-live-in?utm_term=.drznwbp9z#.wxnW1q3mA">which city you should actually live in</a>, <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/miriamberger/which-ousted-arab-spring-ruler-are-you?utm_term=.lc8AQxVe9#.kxaWEQpVN">which ousted Arab Spring ruler you are</a>, and <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/06/harry-potter-house-personality-study/396491/">which Hogwarts house you belong in</a>. But these new online quizzes have a dark edge that their analog predecessors didn’t. In the wake of the U.S. election, a secretive data firm hired by Donald Trump’s campaign <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/20/opinion/the-secret-agenda-of-a-facebook-quiz.html">boasted</a> that it has been using quizzes for years to gather personal information about millions of voters. Its goal: the creation of digital profiles that can predict — and possibly exploit — Americans’ values, anxieties, and political leanings.</p></blockquote>
<p>Based on recent news reports about the information gathering, here’s my take on how the firm was able to acquire enough data to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/us/politics/cambridge-analytica-trump-campaign.html">build psychographic profiles of 50 million Americans</a>:</p>
<ul><li data-selectable-paragraph="">Everyone on Facebook has a numeric ID. Mine is 36802236.</li><li data-selectable-paragraph="">When a user authenticated with a personality test app, their ID was transferred. Through the API, the app could determine that user’s interests, the content they had shared, and the IDs of their friends.</li><li data-selectable-paragraph="">Their friends’ information could then also be scraped, and <em>their</em> likes and friends inferred.</li><li data-selectable-paragraph="">Content could be posted to a user’s timeline, which would then recruit other friends to click through, authenticate, and continue the information crawl.</li></ul>
<p>None of this required any special access: until April, 2015, it was possible to do this using the API available to all developers. In fact, it was described in the 2012 O’Reilly book <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920030195.do"><em>Mining the Social Web</em></a><em>.</em> <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/advanced/rate-limiting">Apps can make 200 calls to the Facebook API per user per hour</a> — more than enough to acquire this information. The team seeded the viral loop by paying participants on Mechanical Turk to take the test.</p>
<p>In 2015, Facebook moved from making these IDs universally available to using something called “app-scoped IDs”. In this new version of their API, a user has a new ID for every application they use, and their friends don’t have IDs if they’ve never used the app. This limits the scope of the crawler somewhat, as the base Facebook ID is unknowable to the app. Only users who have used the app can have their information crawled.</p>
<p>Still, a viral personality test could sweep up a lot of peoples’ data, particularly using the trollish, provocative kinds of content that I had used a decade earlier. And a single organization <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/apps/for-business">can operate multiple apps and link a user’s data across all of them,</a> allowing it to cast a very wide net.</p>
<p>Regardless, according to reports, Steve Bannon approached the firm well before this API change, in late 2013, and a contract was signed in 2014. The likes and shares on a user’s timeline were cross-referenced with voter rolls and other information in order to build complete profiles. This is where <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/17/data-war-whistleblower-christopher-wylie-faceook-nix-bannon-trump">a Cambridge Professor, Dr Alexsandr Kogan, helped</a>: not with the information gathering itself, but with linking the acquired data across multiple sources to build more complete profiles.</p>
<p>Once voter records were mapped to Facebook profiles, they could be used as a corpus for detailed machine learning predictions, and controversial psychographic profiles, that could potentially suggest ways to sway opinions.</p>
<h2 data-selectable-paragraph="">3. Dangerous by design</h2>
<p>It is important to understand that Cambridge Analytica’s acquisition of 50 million user profiles is not an “information breach”, as has been widely reported.</p>
<p>Facebook has been designed to be an information-gathering engine in order to more effectively sell personalized advertising. Its algorithm also attempts to deeply understand your interests in order to “optimize for engagement”: keep you using the site, and therefore viewing those personalized ads, for as long as possible. Its users access Facebook <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/06/business/facebook-bends-the-rules-of-audience-engagement-to-its-advantage.html">for 50 minutes a day</a>.</p>
<p>In order to gather the most information it can, Facebook has been engineered to be the world’s most efficient peer pressure engine. Users on the platform are constantly being persuaded to stay; those who try and leave report being relentlessly emailed with personalized, emotional content to try and get them to come back.</p>
<p>This coercive business model has created a network with three characteristics that make it particularly susceptible to being used as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backdoor_(computing)">backdoor</a> for democracy:</p>
<ul><li data-selectable-paragraph="">It gathers as much information about as many people as possible in a single place. <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/264810/number-of-monthly-active-facebook-users-worldwide/">2.2 billion people</a> have Facebook accounts — and counting.</li><li data-selectable-paragraph="">It serves as a viral pipeline at the center of society where messages can easily spread. <a href="https://www.recode.net/2017/9/7/16270900/social-media-news-americans-facebook-twitter">67% of Americans get news from social media</a>.</li><li data-selectable-paragraph="">It allows messages to be programmatically targeted to users based on detailed characteristics of their profiles. Last year, the company had to intervene <a href="http://fortune.com/2017/09/15/facebook-controversial-ad-targeting/">when its algorithm automatically allowed advertisers to target to “jew haters”</a>. And <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/09/07/did-facebook-ads-traced-to-a-russian-company-violate-u-s-election-law/?utm_term=.c2bce2083962">it may have violated campaign finance laws</a> by allowing anyone to buy these targeted political messages and presenting them without identifying the buyer. (These laws apply to traditional broadcast mediums, but have not been tested or thoroughly applied to internet platforms.)</li></ul>
<p>While Facebook’s API has intentionally been limited to reduce data scraping, this only applies for third-party companies. As a platform, Facebook itself has the ability to make any data inferences it wants, and to package it up as a service to its customers.</p>
<p>That’s important, because in addition to everything that has been described, Facebook (alongside Twitter and Google) <a href="https://thinkprogress.org/facebook-embeds-trump-campaign-70217364e82d/">had employees embedded in both the Trump and Clinton campaigns</a>. <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2017/10/26/facebook-google-twitter-trump-244191">As Politico reported</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p data-selectable-paragraph="">While the companies call it standard practice to work hand-in-hand with high-spending advertisers like political campaigns, the new research details how the staffers assigned to the 2016 candidates frequently acted more like political operatives, doing things like suggesting methods to target difficult-to-reach voters online, helping to tee up responses to likely lines of attack during debates, and scanning candidate calendars to recommend ad pushes around upcoming speeches.</p></blockquote>
<p>All of this activity is powered by deep mines of data about every single one of us.</p>
<p>Elections have become information warfare battlegrounds, fought using all of our personal details without our consent. Here, the weapons are vast data silos like Facebook and Twitter, alongside open, anonymous marketplaces for highly targeted advertising.</p>
<p>Cambridge Analytica <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb6-xz-geH4&amp;feature=youtu.be">argues that these techniques are widely used across PR and marketing</a>, and this is probably true. Just as political campaigns will use any means at their disposal to gain the votes they need, brands will use anything at theirs to gain customers. Similarly, governments and law enforcement will use anything at theirs.</p>
<p>Rather than building a surveillance state controlled from the top down, we’ve all opted into a bottom-up global surveillance society that tracks our activity, interests, and personal networks far more efficiently than any police state ever could. We’re all complicit in building the database of us.</p>
<p>For ethical technologists, one solution is to build security-conscious platforms that aren’t susceptible to this kind of viral abuse — and that certainly don’t rely on them as a business model.</p>
<p>For conscious consumers, one solution is to engage with social networks and apps that actively protect your privacy. (And for smart technology companies to band together to create a kind of Fairtrade label for responsible data use.)</p>
<p>For legislators, one solution is to pass new laws regulating how data is gathered and used.</p>
<p>For all of us, one solution is to band together and use our social power as consumers and citizens to refuse to allow platforms to be built in this way any longer. Democracy is too important, and our freedoms too precious, to be chipped away by social media apps — let alone asinine personality tests designed to learn about you as easily as they spread.</p>
<p>In some ways, for startup founders, for engineers, for users, and for legislators, the current moment is the most important personality test of all:</p>
<p>What kind of citizen are you?</p>
