<h2 data-gu-name="standfirst">Research finds it would take average worker saving all their earnings for 52 years to match wealth of richest 10th of society</h2>
<p>It would take the average earner in the UK 52 years’ worth of earnings to become as wealthy as the richest 10%, according to new research by the <a data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/resolution-foundation">Resolution Foundation</a>.</p>
<p>In a new report, the influential thinktank analyses the Office for National Statistics’ latest wealth and assets survey, which covers the Covid pandemic period of 2020-22.</p>
<figure data-alt="." data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-testid="interactive-element-."></figure>
<p>The authors find that in 2006-08, before the global financial crisis, it would have taken 38 years’ worth of median full-time earnings to lift a worker into the top 10th of the wealth distribution. By 2020-22 that gap had widened, so that it would take 52 years of earnings.</p>
<p>Molly Broome, senior economist at the Resolution Foundation and the lead author of the report, said: “Wealth gaps in Britain are now so large that a typical full-time employee saving all their earnings across their entire working life would still not be able to reach the top of the wealth ladder.”</p>
<p>The gap between the wealth of the average person and someone in the top 10% was £1m in 2006-08, but had widened to £1.3m in real terms by 2020-22, the foundation finds.</p>
<figure data-alt="." data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-testid="interactive-element-."></figure>
<p>Broome added: “These gaps are doubly concerning as wealth mobility in Britain is low – people that start life wealthy tend to stay wealthy, and vice versa.”</p>
<p>Despite the wealth gap widening in absolute terms, however, the share of total wealth in the UK held by the richest households – known as “relative wealth inequality” – has been “broadly stable since the 1980s”, the thinktank points out. Over that time, total wealth in the UK surged from three times the annual GDP, to almost 7.5 times.</p>
<p>So-called “passive” gains, through rising house prices and changes in pension valuations, were the main drivers of the widening wealth gap since 2010, according to the report.</p>
<p>These tended to accrue to older, property-owning households, the research shows – worsening the intergenerational wealth divide.</p>

<figure data-alt="." data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-testid="interactive-element-."></figure>
<p>The average wealth gap between people in their early 30s and early 60s more than doubled in real terms, from £135,000 in 2006-08, to £310,000.</p>
<p>There were also stark regional variations, with the average level of wealth in 2020-22 standing at £290,000 in south-east England, where property prices have tended to rise rapidly, compared with £110,000 in the north-east.</p>
<p>During the pandemic, when millions of workers were protected by the taxpayer-backed furlough scheme, and Covid shutdowns limited opportunities for spending, the data shows many households were able to save, increasing their wealth.</p>
<p>Higher-income households fared much better, however. “The typical family in the lowest-income quintile saw their liquid savings increase by just £80 over the pandemic period (2019-20 to 2021-22), broadly the same as the two years pre-pandemic. In contrast, the typical family in the highest income quintile saw their liquid savings increase by £4,200”, the report finds.</p>
