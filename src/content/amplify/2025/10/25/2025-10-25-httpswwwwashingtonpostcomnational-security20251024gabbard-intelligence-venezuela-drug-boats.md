<p>Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard has thus far refused to share intelligence on lethal operations against alleged narcotics traffickers with key congressional committees, lawmakers say.</p>
<p>The top Democrats on the House and Senate intelligence committees demanded details of U.S. spy agencies’ role in lethal attacks on drug boats in the Caribbean and Pacific oceans, complaining in a letter Friday to Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard that they have received “virtually no information” on the topic since the strikes began, despite repeated requests.</p>
