<p>Timothy Mellon, a reclusive billionaire and a major financial backer of President Trump, is the anonymous private donor <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/24/us/politics/trump-military-pay-donation.html">who gave $130 million</a> to the U.S. government to help pay troops during the shutdown, according to two people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump announced the donation on Thursday night, but he declined to name the person who provided the funds, only calling him a “patriot” and a friend. But the two people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the donation was private, identified him as Mr. Mellon.</p>
<p>Shortly after departing Washington on Friday, Mr. Trump again declined to identify Mr. Mellon while talking to reporters aboard Air Force One. He only said the individual was “a great American citizen” and a “substantial man.”</p>
<p>“He doesn’t want publicity,” Mr. Trump said as he headed to Malaysia. “He prefer that his name not be mentioned which is pretty unusual in the world I come from, and in the world of politics, you want your name mentioned.”</p>
<p>The White House declined to comment. Multiple attempts to reach Mr. Mellon and representatives for him were unsuccessful.</p>
<p>Mr. Mellon, a wealthy banking heir and railroad magnate, is a longtime backer of Mr. Trump and gave tens of millions of dollars to groups supporting the president’s campaign. Last year, he made <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/20/us/politics/timothy-mellon-trump-donation.html">a $50 million donation</a> to a super PAC supporting Mr. Trump, which was one of the largest single contributions ever disclosed.</p>
<p>A grandson of former Treasury Secretary Andrew W. Mellon, Mr. Mellon was not a prominent Republican donor until Mr. Trump was elected. But in recent years, he has poured hundreds of millions of dollars into supporting Mr. Trump and the Republican Party.</p>
<p>Mr. Mellon, who lives primarily in Wyoming, keeps a low profile despite his prolific political spending. He is also a significant supporter of Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who also ran for president last year. Mr. Mellon donated millions to Mr. Kennedy’s presidential campaign and has also given money to his anti-vaccine group, Children’s Health Defense.</p>
<p>The Pentagon said it accepted the donation under the “general gift acceptance authority.”</p>
<p>“The donation was made on the condition that it be used to offset the cost of service members’ salaries and benefits,” Sean Parnell, the Pentagon’s chief spokesman, said in a statement.</p>
<p>Still, the donation appears to be a potential violation of the Antideficiency Act, which prohibits federal agencies from spending money in excess of congressional appropriations or from accepting voluntary services.</p>
<p>It remains unclear how far the donation would go toward covering the salaries of the more than 1.3 million troops who make up the active-duty military. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the Trump administration’s 2025 budget requests about $600 billion in total military compensation. A $130 million donation would equal about $100 a service member.</p>
