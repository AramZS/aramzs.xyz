<p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris said that her time in politics has not come to an end, offering her strongest indication to date that she would consider a third presidential run.</p>
<p>In an interview with the BBC, Ms. Harris said she remained confident a woman will become president one day and that it could “possibly” be her.</p>
<p>“I am not done,” she <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2n7k2veywo">said.</a> “I have lived my entire career as a life of service and it’s in my bones.”</p>
<p>Ms. Harris made the remarks on “<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m002lg3v">Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg</a>”, a prime weekend political show in Britain, as part of a media blitz promoting <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/19/us/politics/harris-abc-kimmel-trump.html">the book she released last month</a> that recounts her 107-day campaign for the White House.</p>
<p>Ms. Harris stressed that she has made no decisions about the 2028 campaign, which is widely expected to feature an expansive field of ambitious governors, members of Congress and political outsiders.</p>
<p>She dismissed early polls showing her trailing in the potentially crowded contest.</p>
<p>“If I listened to polls, I would have not run for my first office, or my second office — and I certainly wouldn’t be sitting here,” she said.</p>
<p>Even in the midst of her book tour, Ms. Harris has taken a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/10/us/politics/kamala-harris-president-california-governor.html">relatively cautious approach</a> to the Trump administration. Earlier this year, she <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/30/us/politics/harris-california-governor-race.html">announced that she would not run</a> for governor of California, declining to make a bid for one of the country’s most powerful perches to push back on the administration and set the future direction for the Democratic Party.</p>
<p>While Democratic governors like JB Pritzker of Illinois, Gavin Newsom of California and Tim Walz of Minnesota, who ran with Ms. Harris on the 2024 Democratic ticket, have been vocal critics of the president, Ms. Harris has carefully picked her moments to speak out.</p>
<p>In the interview, she argued that her predictions during the 2024 campaign that Mr. Trump would run an authoritarian government had come true.</p>
<p>“He said he would weaponize the Department of Justice — and he has done exactly that,” she said.</p>
<p>She <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/19/us/politics/harris-abc-kimmel-trump.html">reiterated her criticism of</a> corporations, universities, media companies and law firms that she said had capitulated to Mr. Trump’s demands, citing ABC’s decision to suspend the late night host Jimmy Kimmel over his remarks following the assassination of Charlie Kirk, a conservative activist.</p>
<p>Her husband, Doug Emhoff, is a partner at Willkie Farr &amp; Gallagher, which was one of the first law firms that cut a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/01/us/politics/trump-law-firm-doug-emhoff-wilkie-farr-gallagher.html">deal</a> to avoid being sanctioned by the Trump administration. Mr. Emhoff has said he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/10/us/politics/kamala-harris-president-california-governor.html">disagreed with the decision</a> by his firm to pledge $100 million in pro bono legal work for causes the president has championed.</p>
