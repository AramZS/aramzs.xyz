<p>It was our duty in office to warn of dangers when we found them. We’re doing that again today.</p>
<p><i>The writers are all former U.S. surgeons general.</i></p>
<p>As former U.S. surgeons general appointed by every Republican and Democratic president since George H.W. Bush, we have collectively spent decades in service as <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/surgeongeneral/index.html">the Nation’s Doctor</a>. We took two sacred oaths in our lifetimes: first, as physicians who swore to care for our patients and, second, as public servants who committed to protecting the health of all Americans.</p>
