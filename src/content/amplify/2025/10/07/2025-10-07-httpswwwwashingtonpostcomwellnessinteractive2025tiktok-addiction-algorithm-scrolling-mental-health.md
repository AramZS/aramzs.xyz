<p>More than 800 U.S. TikTok users shared their data with The Washington Post. We used it to find out why some people become power users, spending hours per day scrolling.</p>
<p>Each circle in the chart represents the daily watch time of a real TikTok user in April 2024.</p>
<p>After a month, more than three-quarters of the users who had typically spent roughly 30 minutes per day on TikTok were now spending nearly twice that much time on the app, on average.</p>
<p>Percent change</p>
<p>-100%0+100%</p>
<p>A few months later, these users’ daily watch times reached 70 minutes, on average. For some, their time spent scrolling every day more than tripled or quadrupled.</p>
<p>October 7, 2025 at 6:00 a.m. EDTToday at 6:00 a.m. EDT</p>
<p>Jon Freilich, a 51-year-old operations manager in California, described his TikTok behavior as an addiction.</p>
<p>“I’ve never smoked or used drugs, so I don’t know what chemical addiction feels like, but I feel like I’m addicted to TikTok,” said Freilich, whose daily watch time on the app increased by more than 50 percent last year. “There are times when I know I should stop scrolling and get work done or go to sleep, but it’s so hard to stop, knowing the next swipe might bring me to a truly interesting video.”</p>
<p>That’s how TikTok draws people in, with an <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/how-tiktok-recommends-videos-for-you?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template">algorithm</a> that serves up an endless stream of hyper-personalized content to users such as Freilich.</p>
<p>But TikTok is massive, fragmented and opaque: Millions of Americans — a <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/12/20/8-facts-about-americans-and-tiktok/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template">third of U.S. adults</a> — are pulled into a nearly infinite variety of niche corners by a recommendation system that we don’t know much about, making it difficult to understand how the constant scroll affects real people.</p>
<p>TikTok and its parent company, ByteDance, share little about how the app keeps users coming back. Journalists and researchers have utilized bot accounts to simulate how the recommendation system is tied to watch time and have conducted self-reported user surveys. But none of these approaches captures real human behavior.</p>
<p>So The Washington Post, through an unprecedented <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@washingtonpost/video/7413093188455468319?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template">partnership</a> with our readers, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/10/07/tiktok-app-study-user-behavior-addiction/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template">collected</a> TikTok watch histories from 1,100 users. We created a database of roughly 15 million videos served up to them in a six-month period last year. Our analyses showed just how effective TikTok is at getting even its heaviest users to swipe more and watch more on its platform.</p>

<p>Among the more than 800 participants who live in the United States, some were barely using TikTok in the first week of April 2024, while others were already spending several hours a day scrolling through videos. Over the next five months, we compared the journeys of people at these two ends of the spectrum — the occasional users and the power users — to see how their TikTok usage evolved.</p>
<p>We focused on three key daily metrics to better understand how users built habits on the app over time:</p>

<p>According to TikTok’s internal documents, revealed as part of a multistate <a href="https://www.iccl.ie/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/TikTok-Kentucky.pdf?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template">lawsuit</a> against the company, it takes just 260 videos, which could be as quick as <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/10/12/g-s1-28040/teens-tiktok-addiction-lawsuit-investigation-documents?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template">35 minutes</a>, to form a habit on the app. At the beginning of our experiment, the lighter users were already spending more than a half-hour a day, on average, scrolling or watching videos.</p>
<p>After just a week, their daily watch time jumped more than 40 percent, from 32 to 45 minutes. The power users’ watch time dipped by 10 percent from 4.5 to 4.1 hours on average.</p>

<p>More time on TikTok could come at a cost.</p>
<p>“It’s displacing the time that we could otherwise spend with friends, family and neighbors, and doing other more helpful and beneficial activities,” said Meredith David, an associate professor of marketing at Baylor University who researches social media use. TikTok videos are “tailored to individuals, and they are fun and exciting. And so we binge scroll and before we know it, we’ve spent an hour and a half on there,” she said.</p>
<p>Samantha Margeson, a 43-year-old product coordinator in Texas, said she is often shocked at how much time she’s spent on TikTok.</p>
<p>“Oh God, how was I on here for 30 minutes straight?” Margeson said she asks herself. “Because the videos are like 30 seconds, they’re a minute, and you just don’t realize because there’s that never-ending scrolling.”</p>

<p>The content that the two groups were seeing was distinct at this point. Lighter users were seeing more broadly appealing content, such as music-focused videos, while power users were seeing “storytime” content, a video style more native to TikTok, highlighting personal stories that are typically strange or dramatic in some way.</p>
<p>These videos are examples of two types of content that our users saw:</p>
<p>Music content</p>

<p>Online product design experts and psychologists told us that TikTok’s design is a big reason users can get sucked into the app so quickly. When you open the app, this is what you see.</p>

<p>Reporter Caitlin Gilbert explains the TikTok design choices that keep you swiping.</p>
<p>“It’s not really that you as the user, or we as users, get to control how we engage with the app but that the app engages us,” said Thomas Essmeyer, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Bremen in Germany who studies digital design and social media.</p>
<p>Swiping from one video to the next is the primary way some users think they can “control” what they see on their For You page. “I’m seeing the videos that I’d like to see. And if I don’t like it, I just keep scrolling,” Margeson said.</p>
<p>Traci Davis, a 56-year-old IT systems administrator in Illinois, said that she will “swipe, swipe, swipe, swipe, swipe, maybe 10 swipes” before she gets to something that she wants to see. Davis added, “I feel like my swiping is training my algorithm.”</p>
<p>According to a TikTok spokesperson, users can adjust their For You feed by filtering specific words or hashtags or resetting their entire feed as if they were a new user.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40219579/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template">2025 study</a> reported that “consumers view TikTok as being much easier, and it’s effortless to use TikTok compared to some of the other platforms” for short-form videos such as Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts, said Baylor’s David, who conducted the research.</p>
<h3 data-component="Heading" data-contentid="E6GKNOJVWBC7LK3XKV5I4IGAZY" data-file="custom-template-components/src/Heading/Heading.js" data-style="stitches">After five months …</h3>
<p>By September, the gap between the occasional and power users had narrowed. Now, occasional users were spending more than 70 minutes a day on TikTok — more than double the time they spent at the start of the experiment. Power users were still spending more than four hours per day on the app.</p>

<p>More casual users opened the app more often per day, now nearly eight times. Heavier users still opened the app about 20 times per day. Both sets of users swiped through videos faster, too.</p>

<p>Watching “short-form videos [tends] to lower one’s self-control, which then leads to more impulsive behaviors,” David said.</p>
<p>This can have negative effects on our lives outside the app. In a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/08944393241279422?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template">2024 study</a>, David reported that watching TikTok videos is more strongly correlated with “phubbing” — a portmanteau of “phone” and “snubbing” — when people choose to pay attention to the videos rather than the people they are with.</p>
<p>Casey Lumley, 20, a college student in Utah, regularly spent several hours per day on the app, according to data they provided to The Post last year, but has since set a daily time limit for TikTok. “I would often use the app to have background noise, it became where I didn’t have thoughts of my own,” Lumley said. “It was harder for me to create my own opinions, it was harder for me to express my own thoughts in the day, and I think that took a toll with me. [I] just became a bit mindless, a bit distant throughout day-to-day.”</p>

<p>The content watched was more similar between the two groups by September, including a surge of political content on the app, with the election just a couple of months away. The original group of lighter users, who once saw disproportionate amounts of music content, were now much more likely to see a wider range of videos.</p>
<h2 data-component="Heading" data-contentid="HD3GAQ98CD53Q0MP7318R1V5J4" data-file="custom-template-components/src/Heading/Heading.js" data-style="stitches">Developing compulsive behaviors</h2>
<p>After five months, the data trends for both groups suggested features of <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306460322001769?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template">compulsive behavior</a> — repeatedly feeling urges to do something, even if the person thinks it’s harmful in the long run.</p>
<p>Increases in watch time could be a sign of <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0747563218303972?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template">bingeing behavior</a>, where a person finds it’s hard to stop something once they start. Opening the app more often may represent <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11469-019-00062-9?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template">craving</a>, while the faster swiping for new videos could be an indication of <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2022-17934-001?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template">automatic or habitual behaviors</a>.</p>
<p>In response to detailed questions from The Post about this analysis, a TikTok spokesperson said, “We empower people with tools to shape their experience, with choices to tailor their For You feed, decide screen time, and save recipes, outfits, travel plans, playlists, and other things they want to try in their daily life.”</p>
<p>TikTok did not address any of The Post’s specific findings or what users and experts told reporters.</p>
<p>“Lately I’ve found myself scrolling past more and more videos. It’s like I’m stuck in a rut with the algorithm, and it keeps showing me the same kinds of things, but the addiction is making me crave more and more,” Freilich said.</p>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36716180/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template">Research</a> has shown that users on TikTok report being more prone to losing track of time and spending more time on the app than intended, compared with users on Instagram.</p>
<p>“It’s a continuous stream of videos that are tailored to the particular individual, and the effectiveness of the algorithm leads to users of TikTok feeling more enjoyment while they’re watching those videos and also more time distortion,” David said.</p>
<p>Although TikTok is set to be <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/09/25/trump-order-tiktok-deal/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template">spun off</a> into a U.S. joint venture largely controlled by American investors, the app’s algorithm will remain under ByteDance ownership. It’s unclear how the new version of the platform will change, but officials say the algorithm will be duplicated and retrained on U.S. data for the spin-off.</p>
<p>Our brains seem to respond to TikTok videos personalized to our tastes in ways similar to how they react to money, food and other pleasurable substances, said <a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/marc-potenza/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template">Marc Potenza</a>, a professor of psychiatry at Yale School of Medicine.</p>
<p>DIAGRAM: Watching personalized TikTok videos recommended by the algorithm activates the brain’s reward system more compared with non-personalized videos, research shows. At the same time, it changes the activity of the brain’s default mode network, which may suggest increased attention to and immersion in the TikTok videos and decreased self-control. The default mode network has also been linked to feelings of craving in substance use disorders, though these brain systems need to be further studied, Potenza said.</p>

<p>The end result of personalization? A stronger loop of more swiping that may deepen the habit.</p>
<p>The power users’ time on the app also suggests that they might have a threshold of three to four hours of watch time per day — after a certain point, many users could just be swiping out of boredom. “Today, it’s really difficult to be bored, because the second you feel slightly, ‘I don’t know what to do with myself,’ the phone is there that you can just pop up,” Essmeyer said. “The only goal then probably is to spend time until something else happens.”</p>
<p>Davis spent about twice as much time on TikTok in September of last year compared with April. She described how the app “always seems like the convenient option.”</p>
<p>“It’s more just like a habit, like, you leave a room and turn the light switch off, I sit down, somebody texts me, I pick up my phone, I look at the TV, ‘Oh, I’ve seen this movie before.’ And then I pop open TikTok,” Davis said. “Once you open it, it’s like, you know, all bets are off.”</p>

<p>Although most of the users in our database ended up spending more time on TikTok after five months, not all did.</p>
<p>Since the experiment, several users told The Post that they have tried using screen time limits either from the app or their phones to cut down on use, but they simply continue to scroll when they reach those limits. Others have found that deleting the app from their phone has worked to reduce their usage, especially when they began to feel a toll on their mental health.</p>
<p>“The entire design is completely created as interaction to make you happy for the moment, not for the long term,” Essmeyer said.</p>
<p>Those “take a break” ad-like videos from TikTok were one of the most-skipped video types in our analysis, as people continued to scroll when they encountered them in their feeds.</p>
<p>A TikTok spokesperson highlighted screen time limits, break reminder videos, and limiting or muting notifications as some of the features the app offers to help people manage their use.</p>
<p>If you’re worried about how much time you spend on TikTok, here are some things you can do to limit your use:</p>
<ul><li>“Be cognizant of the amount of time you’re spending” on the app, David said. You can check your app-specific screen time on your phone or download your own TikTok data.</li><li>Consider turning off notifications for TikTok, set manual screen time limits on your <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/set-schedules-with-screen-time-iphb0c7313c9/ios">iPhone</a> or <a href="https://support.google.com/android/answer/9346420?hl=en#zippy=%2Climit-how-much-time-you-spend-in-an-app-each-day">Android</a> phone, or use third-party apps such as <a href="https://appblock.app/">AppBlock</a> or <a href="https://freedom.to/">Freedom</a> to block or restrict your ability to open the app.</li><li>Delete TikTok from your phone and use it only on a desktop or tablet, where scrolling is less smooth. <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/09637214241246480">Adding friction</a> is a powerful way to shape habits and make alternatives easier.</li><li>Think about<i> how</i> you use social media and try to be more active. “Social media use is more helpful for our well-being if we use it actively to communicate with others instead of passively using it,” David said. Liking posts, commenting or replying to others is more engaging and social than just mindlessly scrolling.</li><li>“Don’t be on a platform just because everybody is there, but be there because you can do some things that you want to do specifically there,” Essmeyer said.</li></ul>

<p><b>Methodology</b></p>
<p>Using TikTok watch histories shared by more than 800 U.S. users, we calculated the time each user spent watching videos on the app every day between April 1 and Sept. 5, 2024. We calculated the number of session starts based on the number of unique app sessions per day. The time between swipes was calculated based on the time between consecutive videos watched within a session. To establish the “lighter” and “power” user cohorts, our participants were split into quintiles based on how much time they spent daily on the app on average during the first week of April, with the bottom and top cohorts representing the two most extreme user groups. Read more about our data collection and analysis here.</p>
