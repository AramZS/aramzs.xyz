<p>Mozilla is bringing programmatic advertising to Firefox through a partnership with Index Exchange.</p>
<p>The two companies announced the partnership on Monday during Advertising Week New York 2025. As part of the deal, Mozilla and Index Exchange are co-creating a programmatic model that gives advertisers access to Mozilla’s Firefox New Tab audience, with inventory available exclusively through Private Marketplace (PMP) deals via Index Exchange.</p>
<p>“Advertising funds the open internet, but it needs a new foundation,” Suba Vasudevan, COO of <a href="http://mozilla.org/">Mozilla.org</a> and SVP at Mozilla Corp., said in a statement. “Marketers have long talked about trusted brands and trusted creative—but what’s missing is trust in the platforms where ads actually run.”</p>
<p>She added, “By engineering trust into the advertising environment itself, we’re creating a higher-quality audience experience and a stronger performance channel for brands.”</p>
<p>Marketers using the new platform will be able to reach large, engaged audiences in respectful, brand-safe environments. They will also be working in an environment that does not include personal identifiers or cross-site tracking.</p>
<p>“Our partnership with Mozilla reflects a shared belief that programmatic can evolve to serve both brands and people better,” Lori Goode, CMO of Index Exchange, said in a statement. “By aligning Mozilla’s trusted environment with Index’s infrastructure, we’re co-creating a new model that gives marketers confidence their campaigns are running in spaces designed for quality, control, and lasting impact.”</p>
