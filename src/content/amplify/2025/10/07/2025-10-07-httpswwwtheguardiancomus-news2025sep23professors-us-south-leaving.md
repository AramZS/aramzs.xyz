<h2 data-gu-name="standfirst">Survey by American Association of Professors shows nearly quarter of respondents are switching due to states’s politics</h2>
<p>Many professors in the US south, particularly in Florida, <a data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/south-carolina">South Carolina</a> and Texas, are considering leaving their state because of the impact the political climate is having on education, according to a new survey by the American Association of Professors.</p>
<p>Of those interviewed in the survey, <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TL9hu1Y-UMfqcqt3Jt95LGRj-rEPj2LP/view">roughly a quarter</a> of respondents said they applied for a job in higher education in another state since the start of 2023.</p>
<p>Heather Houser worked as a professor in the English department, teaching American literature and environmental humanities, at the University of <a data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/texas">Texas</a> at Austin for 14 years. Like the growing number of professors in the stronghold Republican state, she found the increasing government oversight on higher education alarming. Houser left Texas earlier this year for a new teaching position at The University of Antwerp in Belgium.</p>
<p>“I know a lot of people who’ve been on the job market for several years and they’d be gone by now if not for the factors that make it hard to leave,” Houser said. “It comes with sacrifices, and I still feel so much for my students and colleagues back in Texas. It’s hard to know what they’re enduring.”</p>
<p>The survey received responses from approximately 4,000 faculty members across the south and included other states, such as Georgia, Florida, Tennessee, and Kentucky, in its <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TL9hu1Y-UMfqcqt3Jt95LGRj-rEPj2LP/view">findings</a>. About 25% of the professors in Texas who responded said they have applied for teaching roles in other states in the last two years, with another 25% saying they intend to start a search.</p>
<p>Last year, salary was the top reason as to why educators across the south were seeking employment elsewhere. In this year’s findings, however, “broad political climate” was the top motivator.</p>
<p>“I had been looking to leave UT Austin and Texas for many years,” Houser said, “part was just a desire for personal change, but much bigger was my concern about higher education and the direction it was going. I was worried that the ability to teach things I cared about like environmental or social justice would become increasingly hard or even discouraged.”</p>
<p>The Republican governor of Texas, Greg Abbott, signed a bill in <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/14/new-texas-bans-law-diversity-offices-state-higher-education">2023</a> that banned diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) offices and initiatives in higher education institutions across the state.</p>
<p>Under the law, called SB17, these offices had to start closing from January 2024, and any initiatives that promoted groups of individuals based on race, ethnicity and gender were prohibited in universities. At the University of Texas at Austin, where Houser taught, this led to resource cancellations, office closures and staff <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/dei-fallout-texas-university/story?id=114470961">firings</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/10/texas-am-university-children-lit-professor-fired">this month</a>, at Texas A&amp;M, a children’s literature professor was fired after a video of a student objecting to course material about gender identity and sexuality went viral. The dean of the school’s college of arts and sciences and the head of the department were also removed from their roles, the university president, Mark Welsh III, confirmed in a statement.</p>
<p>The university passed an <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://thebatt.com/news/dean-of-college-of-arts-and-sciences-department-head-removed-after-viral-video/">audit</a> earlier in the year to ensure that the school was complying with a new <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://capitol.texas.gov/tlodocs/88R/billtext/html/SB00017F.htm">state law</a> banning DEI in public universities, according to Battalion, the student newspaper. The video put significant pressure on the school, primarily from external Republican politicians and officials.</p>
<p>“A lot of people want to leave, but a lot of people might not be able to look,” Houser said, speaking to how difficult it is to get a tenured professor job, especially in the humanities.</p>
<p>Houser received her job offer in Belgium back in summer 2024, before Trump was elected, but couldn’t see anything changing in the state or institution, so she decided to push forward with the move. And it didn’t come without sacrifice. Learning Dutch, taking a pay cut and understanding an entirely new system were just some of the challenges she is having to navigate.</p>
<p>Such is also the case for Wendy Watson, who left a role as a pre-law adviser and professor at the University of North Texas and moved to Ball State University in August this year, after 15 years of teaching there.</p>
<p>“The classes I taught that were most likely to eventually feel the sting of SB17 and the legislation sure to follow were Gay Rights and the Constitution and Jurisprudence,” Watson said. “You cannot teach a robust class on jurisprudence without addressing critical legal studies, critical race theory and critical gender theory. You just can’t.”</p>
<p>In private conversations with other faculty, Watson recounted describing what they all knew: that SB 17 was just the beginning.</p>
<p>“We would likely see specific classes taken out of the catalog. We had already seen our School of Education rewrite course descriptions for both undergrad and grad classes (without input from the faculty who taught those classes) to remove any reference to race, gender and queer identity,” said Watson. “Everyone I spoke with felt fear, frustration, and hopelessness.”</p>
<p>While Watson expressed positive feelings about leaving, the departure again came with immense sacrifice. A 25% pay cut was involved, as was moving from a role as a principal lecturer to an assistant and losing the ability to teach political science.</p>
<p>“If things feel bad for you now, they are likely to get much worse,” was Watson’s advice to other professors considering a similar out-of-state move. “I know it feels like giving up and abandoning your students, but it’s like the guidance on an aeroplane: put your own mask on first and then help those around you.”</p>
