title: Vegan Pressure Cooker Red Beans and Rice
---
<p>Here’s a vegan version of the classic New Orleans dish that uses smoked paprika, miso paste and soy sauce to add a savory notes. Pressure cookers are ideal for preparing dried beans; even unsoaked beans cook quickly and evenly, so that the beans become creamy but still keep their shape (though we’ve got instructions for a <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020816-vegan-slow-cooker-red-beans-and-rice">slow cooker approach</a>, too). Here, you want the beans to be very tender, so that the stew is thick — with a few beans that have slightly broken down — and not soupy. This vegan version of “Monday red beans” is not as creamy as the one made with pork, so smashing a few beans against the side of the pot at the end of cooking is particularly important. Louisiana-style hot sauce is key as well.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul><li>Kosher salt and black pepper</li><li>½ to 1teaspoon ground cayenne, plus more to taste</li><li>1pound dried red kidney beans (no need to soak)</li><li>Cooked rice, for serving</li><li>Sliced scallions, for serving</li><li>Louisiana-style hot sauce, for serving</li></ul>

<h2>Preparation</h2>
<ol><li><p>Turn on the sauté setting of a 6- to 8-quart electric pressure cooker and heat the oil. Add the onion, season with salt, and cook, stirring occasionally, until limp and translucent, 6 to 8 minutes. Add the celery and bell pepper, and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, 5 to 8 minutes. Add the chopped garlic, miso paste, smoked paprika, sweet paprika, onion powder, garlic powder, cayenne and sage (if using). Grind in a generous amount of black pepper and add ¾ teaspoon salt. Stir well to combine all the ingredients, then turn off the sauté setting.</p></li><li><p>Add the beans, bay leaves, thyme and 5½ cups water. Scrape the bottom of the pot to loosen any browned bits. Cook on high pressure until the beans are creamy, 50 minutes to 1 hour.</p></li><li><p>Turn off the pressure cooker and allow the pressure to reduce naturally for 10 minutes, then release the remaining pressure manually and open the lid. Add the soy sauce, and season to taste with salt and cayenne. Using a fork, mash some of the beans against the side of the pressure cooker to make the mixture creamy. It will continue to thicken as it sits, or you can turn on the sauté setting and let the mixture bubble for a few minutes to thicken. Discard the bay leaves and thyme sprigs. Top the beans with hot cooked rice and scallions; serve with hot sauce.</p></li></ol>

<p>Under self-imposed quarantine, 70 years old. Powdered onions and garlic are not the most delicious option but their shelf life, small storage requirements, and availability make them the best option in a crisis. The old Girl Scout in me keeps dry goods and spices in the pantry to ‘Be Prepared’ for any contingency: hurricanes, blizzard, COVID.</p>

<p>Oddly, salt isn’t mentioned in the ingredient list, but step 1 includes adding 3/4 tsp of it. Since both soy sauce and miso typically contain a huge amount of sodium, it might be a good idea to hold off on adding salt until the very end, and then only adding it if it really seems necessary.</p>

<p>Louisiana native here. Instead of miso and soy (which honestly feel pretty sacrilegious) just add some liquid smoke. My dad went vegan for a few years and that's what we used to give our beans the smokiness they need.</p>

<p>With a few adjustments, this came out great! * reduced water to 4c, as my InstantPot guide says to use 2-3 cups per cup of dried beans * 1/2 tsp of salt because my Miso is salty—next time, I’ll reduce that further to just 1/4 tsp * Omitted onion &amp; garlic powder—fresh is plenty. * Finish Step 3 with 1tsp gumbo file powder to thicken * Sauté &amp; adjust flavors The gumbo file was a last minute inspiration! The smoked paprika was too overpowering, so I’ll just use 1 tsp. next time.</p>

<p>Used an InstantPot (50 minutes high pressure / 10 minutes before release) and made 1 day before to let flavor set in. WOW - maybe the best red beans and rice I've ever had, definitely the best I've ever made. Changes (serves 4): 4 cups water / 1 cup dried beans, 2 celery stalks, 1.5 tsp Pimenton de la Vera Dulce (rather than regular sweet paprika), 1 tsp smoked paprika, 1 tsp cayenne (no sage), 2 bay leaves, 2 tsp soy sauce, and ended with 2 tsp file powder. Kept everything else the same. Delish</p>

<p>Great recipe, and vegetarian without sacrificing deep flavor for the meat-cravers. Added some Better Than Boullion (roasted vegetable) at half the normal strength, mixed in the water. Cut liquid to about 5 cups, based on other people’s reviews. Threw in some Tony Cachere’s and Penzey’s cajun seasoning for good measure. Cooked for 1 hr, released pressure, adjusted seasoning w soy sauce and liquid smoke, and gave it a final 15 minutes of pressure cooking. Delicious , creamy, perfect texture.</p>

<p>I don't understand this instruction in step 2: "Cook on high pressure until the beans are creamy, 50 minutes to 1 hour." How are you supposed to know when the beans become creamy while they're cooking at high pressure? Am I missing something here? I've seen similar instructions in other pressure cooker recipes but never understood how you could possibly know.</p>

<p>Since I used small red beans, I pressure cooked for 40 minutes, but otherwise I made this with few modifications other than adjusting the amounts for a smaller batch. I didn't have miso, but just a splash of liquid smoke at the end as suggested in another comment did the trick. In the absence of the miso, I used a tbsp of tomato paste instead, which probably gave it a heartier flavor profile. Really delicious, though!</p>

<p>Soaked the red beans in room temp for a few hours before proceeding. This is delicious!! Hearty but not heavy and wonderfully smoky. Had to use much more salt at the end for seasoning so i wouldn’t worry about too much salt. I didn’t add extra cayenne for the rest of the fam and it wasn’t spicy. I’m sure purists would object but I like it w sliced pickled jalapeño (both pepper and a bit of juice) for extra heat and zing. This also makes a LOT so next time I’d freeze some. Five stars</p>
