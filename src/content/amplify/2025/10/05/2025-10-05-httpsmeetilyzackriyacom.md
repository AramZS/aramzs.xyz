Being open-source means you have full control over your data and can customize it to your needs.</p></details>
<details><summary>Does Meetily offer a subscription option?</summary><p>While Meetily is free and self-hosted by default (giving you complete control over your data), we're introducing a subscription option for users who prefer a fully managed backend without infrastructure management.
