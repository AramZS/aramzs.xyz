<p>The House has no votes planned this week, as Republicans try to pressure Senate Democrats to give in and open the government.</p>
<p>Senators return to Washington on Monday without a deal to end the government shutdown now entering its sixth day.</p>
<p>The shutdown has sidelined 750,000 federal workers and forced many others to work without pay since funding laws expired early Wednesday. It has almost <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/10/01/government-shutdown-affects-agencies-closed-open/">completely shuttered</a> agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency and the Education Department, though <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/09/27/trump-government-shutdown-plan/?itid=lk_inline_manual_5">national security and law enforcement functions</a> are continuing.</p>
