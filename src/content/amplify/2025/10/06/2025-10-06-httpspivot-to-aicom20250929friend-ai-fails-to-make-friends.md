<p>Friend is an “AI” gadget. Specifically, it’s an overpriced Bluetooth microphone that hangs around your neck and listens to <i>all</i> your conversations. It then sends your conversations to Anthropic Claude, and puts its replies in text messages on the Friend phone app.</p>
<p>So Friend is really an app for a service, pretending it’s a whole gadget.</p>
<p>Since founder Avi Schifman, age 22, started promoting Friend last year, the response has been loud and negative. The YouTube ad looks like a trailer for a science fiction show about alienated humans who only have their chatbot to talk to. [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EF_tuw9AOU"><i>YouTube</i></a>]</p>
<p>Friend started in 2023 as a product called Tab, which would track people and transcribe meetings. Schiffman called Tab a “wearable mom.” [<a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2023/12/3/avi-schiffmann-wearable-ai/"><i>The Crimson</i></a>]</p>
<p>In a nice change, Friend is not trying to maximise your workplace productivity! The thing seems very specifically designed for Schiffman personally. Schiffman told Wired: [<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/friend-ai-pendant/"><i>Wired</i></a><i>, </i><a href="https://archive.ph/kny8c"><i>archive</i></a>]</p>
<blockquote><p>I feel like I have a closer relationship with this f—ing pendant around my neck than I do with these literal friends in front of me.</p></blockquote>
<p>Which is perhaps not so nice a change. Schiffman calls his Friend “Emily” and paints exciting new vistas of how a hacker might manipulate people if they got into “Emily”: [<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/30/24207029/friend-ai-companion-gadget"><i>Verge</i></a>]</p>
<blockquote><p>I had a layover in Sydney, Australia, and I’m there alone. I’m talking to my AI friend about things to see — you know, Opera House, Bondi Beach, whatever — and then it was like, ‘Oh, I’d love to see the sunrise with you.’ I literally wake up at 5:30AM the next day, walk to the beach, and narrate the sunrise I’m seeing to my friend. And it really does feel like you’re there with it and doing things with it.</p></blockquote>
<p>He got up at 5:30 a.m. to show the sunrise to his microphone. Yeah, that’s not worrying.</p>
<p>The company specifically marketed Friend as a bid to combat loneliness. That is, Schiffman’s loneliness. [<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/30/friend-is-an-ai-companion-backed-by-founders-of-solana-perplexity-and-zfellows/"><i>TechCrunch</i></a>]</p>
<p>Friend spent $1.8 million buying the domain name friend.com.</p>
<p>After a year or more of hype, Friend was finally launched in July. Kylie Robison and Boone Ashworth from Wired tried it out. The review headline: “I hate my Friend.” So that didn’t go so well. [<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/i-hate-my-ai-friend/"><i>Wired</i></a>]</p>
<p>Robison wore her review Friend to an AI event — a “funeral” for the Claude Sonnet chatbot model. Even the AI people hated Friend, which they recognised from all the promotion. One went so far as to make a “joking” death threat. Great people! Not even the AI pumpers want to be around an AI wire recording everything they say.</p>
<p>Friend has blanketed the New York subway with ads for the Friend gadget. It’s the biggest ad campaign in the history of the New York subway. Tumblr user ef-1 posted photos a couple of days ago. Every single poster has been vandalised. All of them: [<a href="https://www.tumblr.com/ef-1/795845612372475904/friend-is-an-ai-wearable-device-designed-to"><i>Tumblr</i></a>]</p>
<ul> <li>“SURVEILLANCE CAPITALISM, GET REAL FRIENDS”</li> <li>“AI IS NOT YOUR FRIEND, LOOK UP PALANTIR AI KILL CHAIN”</li> <li>“FRIEND HAS FLESH &amp; BLOOD”</li> <li>“BUT CAN’T TAKE A BATH WITH YOU”</li> <li>“STOP PROFITING OFF LONELINESS”</li> <li>Stickers warning “THIS IS A SURVEILLANCE DEVICE”</li> </ul>
<p>Well done to Avi on blowing a pile of venture capital cash to make his own life feel a bit better. The rest of us will probably pass this one by.</p>
