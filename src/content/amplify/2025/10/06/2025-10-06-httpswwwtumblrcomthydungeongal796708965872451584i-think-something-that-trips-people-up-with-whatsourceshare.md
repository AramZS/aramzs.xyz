<p>I think something that trips people up with "what if the players leave" is envisioning a megadungeon as just a modern static dungeon but larger. Leaving becomes less appealing with the knowledge that the rooms you emptied don't always STAY empty.</p>
<p>Yep! And while most older editions didn't have restocking procedures (restocking is something that may have happened with individual DMs at the time but only became formalized as a concept via OSR blogs) moving through "cleared" rooms in a dungeon still involved the threat of wandering monsters. Even if the player characters had "cleared" a nice path for themselves through the dungeon, odds were that on their way out of the dungeon or back there they would run into <em>something</em>.</p>
<p>And yeah, the modern WotC D&amp;D dungeon is much more static in this regard owing to a change in how dungeons are presented. While D&amp;D 3e and 3.5 upon release did include procedures for wandering monsters and random wilderness encounters, those procedures didn't actually make their way to most official adventure modules and in my experience they were never a defining part of the 3e playstyle, and 4e and 5e have continued that legacy. Within the context of WotC D&amp;D, dungeons are mostly places for containing predetermined encounters. Which is not strictly speaking worse, but it's going to trip up people who assume a megadungeon to be a bunch of rooms with encounters in them, except there's a lot of rooms.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if there's a wide consensus as to what the exact definition of megadungeon is, but one that I think is somewhat useful is "a dungeon that is big enough to support an entire campaign's worth of play." Gygax's own Castle Greyhawk is an example of a classic megadungeon; I think Temple of Elemental Evil might count to an extent (but the mega part is arguable in that case); and lots of modern modules that have emerged from the OSR definitely count.</p>
<p>As said, I'm not sure if there's actually a clear line you can draw where a dungeon stops being "a really big dungeon" and when it becomes a megadungeon, but I think what makes a megadungeon is that it's persistent, that it supports play through a really wide range of levels, and that it can basically act as the centerpiece for an entire campaign.</p>
<p>I think the distinction between "dungeon" and "megadungeon" has little to do with the dungeon itself, and more to do with how it's used.</p>
<p>Bear with me for a moment, but consider <em>Dungeon Meshi</em>. Laios's party and most other parties are delving into the same dungeon, but they engage with them very differently.</p>
<p>Think about that time Laios <em>et al</em> encountered Namari and the gnomes. Namari had a straightforward quest; follow a couple of scholar-mages as they examine the dungeon's magic circles, make sure they get out alive, get paid. Maybe complain about being used as a human shield a few times.</p>
<p>By contrast, at least for the first few volumes, Laios <em>et al</em> are just trying to survive the dungeon and delve deeper. When the story starts, they're on a quest to locate a specific gate, which mostly involves exploring the dungeon and not dying in the process. After the inciting incident, they need to locate and slay a specific dragon, which mostly involves re-exploring the dungeon and not dying in the process (or while slaying the dragon).</p>
<p>I can't honestly say that <em>Dungeon Meshi</em> is a megadungeon manga; it's plot- and character-driven to a degree that megadungeons generally can't be, and while it puts more focus on resource management than most fantasy series, it's pretty loose and abstract compared to the mechanical precision a megadungeon TRPG needs for players to interact with the systems.</p>
<p>But Laios's party followed a more megadungeon-like arc than Namari's, despite the fact that they were in the same dungeon at the same time.</p>
