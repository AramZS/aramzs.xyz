  at://work is a modern job board built on ATProtocol where your profile and job
  listings are stored on your own Personal Data Server, giving you true
  ownership of your professional data. As a full AppView with XRPC APIs and
  remote MCP server capabilities, it makes job market data accessible to both
  users and developers while proving that professional networking can be
  decentralized and user-controlled.

title: 'Introducing at://work: A Job Board That Puts You in Control'

<p>at://work is a modern job board built on ATProtocol where your profile and job listings are stored on your own Personal Data Server, giving you true ownership of your professional data. As a full AppView with XRPC APIs and remote MCP server capabilities, it makes job market data accessible to both users and developers while proving that professional networking can be decentralized and user-controlled.</p>
<p>I'm excited to launch at://work, a modern job board built on ATProtocol that fundamentally changes how job listings and professional networking work on the decentralized web.</p>
<figure><a data-index="1" href="https://atwork.place/"><img src="https://ngerakines.leaflet.pub/api/atproto_images?did=did:plc:cbkjy5n7bk3ax2wplmtjofq2&amp;cid=bafkreig2mdsl6ropwxy3j367o2wh42ig74hgf3hoxfbcxp6s522xycahwy"/></a></figure>
<p>When you sign in to at://work using OAuth, you're logging in with your ATProtocol handle (like @alice.bsky.social). But here's what makes it different: your profile and job listings aren't stored on our servers. They live on your Personal Data Server (PDS), which means you actually own your content. We're just indexing what you've already published to the ATmosphere.</p>
<p>This isn't just a philosophical difference. It means your professional presence exists independently of any single platform. Your job listings and for-hire status are portable, verifiable, and permanently under your control.</p>
<p>at://work supports two types of identity profiles. If you're looking for work, you can mark yourself as "for-hire" and let opportunities find you. If you're hiring, you can publish job listings with full location support and rich content formatting using ATProtocol's content facets, including mentions, tags, and URLs. Setting up your profile is straightforward—check out the <a href="https://atwork.place/help/profiles">profile creation guide</a> to get started.</p>
<p>The platform includes comprehensive search functionality for both job listings and identity profiles, along with location-based search and an interactive map that shows where opportunities are clustering. Whether you're looking for remote positions or trying to find local talent, the search tools make it straightforward.</p>
<p>As a complete AppView, at://work indexes job listings and profiles as they're published across the ATmosphere. But we've also opened up the functionality through XRPC endpoints, allowing developers to integrate job listing features into their own applications—whether they're built on ATProtocol or not.</p>
<p>To demonstrate this capability, we've built a JavaScript widget that makes it easy to embed job listings on your blog or website. The comprehensive XRPC API documentation shows exactly how to tap into the at://work index programmatically.</p>
<p>For developers working with AI tools and agents, at://work functions as a fully remote Model Context Protocol (MCP) server. You can search, list, and retrieve job listings through the MCP endpoint at https://atwork.place/mcp, making it simple to incorporate job market data into your AI-powered workflows. For setup instructions and usage examples, see the <a href="https://atwork.place/help/mcp">MCP integration guide</a>.</p>
<p>at://work demonstrates what becomes possible when professional networking moves to an open protocol. Instead of your career data being locked in proprietary platforms, it exists in a standardized format that any application can access and display. You're not just using a job board—you're participating in a professional graph that you control.</p>
<p>We're launching at://work to show that job boards can be decentralized, user-controlled, and developer-friendly all at once. Check it out at https://atwork.place/ and see what professional networking looks like when you own the data.</p>
