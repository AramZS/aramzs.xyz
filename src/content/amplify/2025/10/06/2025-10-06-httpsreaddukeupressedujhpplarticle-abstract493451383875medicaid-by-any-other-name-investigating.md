  Abstract. Context: Medicaid is the largest health insurance program by
  enrollment in the United States. The program varies across states and across a
  variety of dimensions, including what it is called; some states use
  state-specific naming conventions, for example, MassHealth in
  Massachusetts.Methods: In a preregistered online survey experiment
  (N = 5,807), the authors tested whether public opinion shifted in response to
  the use of state-specific Medicaid program names for the provision of
  information about program enrollment.Findings: Replacing “Medicaid” with a
  state-specific name resulted in a large increase in the share of respondents
  reporting that they “haven't heard enough to say” how they felt about the
  program. This corresponded to a decrease in both favorable and unfavorable
  attitudes toward the program. Although confusion increased among all partisan
  groups, there is evidence that state-specific names may also strengthen
  positive perceptions among Republicans. Providing enrollment information
  generally did not affect public opinion.Conclusions: These findings offer
  suggestive evidence that state-specific program names may muddle understanding
  of the program as a government-provided benefit. Policy makers seeking to
  bolster support for the program or claim credit for expanding or improving it
  may be better served by simply referring to it as “Medicaid.”

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> Medicaid is the largest health insurance program by enrollment in the United States. The program varies across states and across a variety of dimensions, including what it is called; some states use state-specific naming conventions, for example, MassHealth in Massachusetts.</p>
<p><strong>Methods:</strong> In a preregistered online survey experiment (<em>N</em> = 5,807), the authors tested whether public opinion shifted in response to the use of state-specific Medicaid program names for the provision of information about program enrollment.</p>
<p><strong>Findings:</strong> Replacing “Medicaid” with a state-specific name resulted in a large increase in the share of respondents reporting that they “haven't heard enough to say” how they felt about the program. This corresponded to a decrease in both favorable and unfavorable attitudes toward the program. Although confusion increased among all partisan groups, there is evidence that state-specific names may also strengthen positive perceptions among Republicans. Providing enrollment information generally did not affect public opinion.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusions:</strong> These findings offer suggestive evidence that state-specific program names may muddle understanding of the program as a government-provided benefit. Policy makers seeking to bolster support for the program or claim credit for expanding or improving it may be better served by simply referring to it as “Medicaid.”</p>
