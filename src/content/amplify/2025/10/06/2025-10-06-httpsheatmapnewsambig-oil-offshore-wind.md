<p><em><strong>Current conditions: </strong>A warm front coming from the Southwest is raising temperatures up to 30 degrees Fahrenheit above average across the Upper Midwest • A heat wave nearly 200 miles north of Montreal in La Tuque, Quebec, is sending temperatures to nearly 80 degrees today • Typhoon Matmo has made landfall in southern China, forcing thousands to evacuate amid peak holiday season.</em></p>
<h2>THE TOP FIVE</h2>
<h3>1. The U.S. wind industry’s latest defender? Big Oil.</h3>
<p>The United States’ beleaguered offshore-wind industry has found a new ally in its effort to fend off President Donald Trump’s assault: Big Oil. On Sunday, the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/7e3a2879-d7d9-40a3-8ea8-ae89a9e29121?accessToken=zwAAAZm1_jkVkc9-Oih519lAo9OOqK6JqeKRIQ.MEUCIQDFxKg4EriPf9SscGh8ukhJxqLwpz78zv_AVJmbi8MiwAIgR_hNHvx25BMwGFAk4DHc0rK5dHhI4FT5sfTSOo54l_g&amp;segm"><u><em><em>Financial Times</em></em></u></a> published an interview with Shell’s top executive in the U.S., in which she called the administration’s decision to halt permitting on seaborne turbines “very damaging” to investment and warned that a future Democratic president could use the precedent Trump set to attack the oil and gas industry. “However far the pendulum swings one way, it’s likely that it’s going to swing just as far the other way,” Colette Hirstius, president of Shell USA, told the newspaper when asked about the Trump administration’s stop-work orders on offshore wind farms. “I certainly would like to see those projects that have been permitted in the past continue to be developed. Similarly, if you think of the business I run offshore [Gulf of Mexico], that type of permitting uncertainty has been utilized to undermine the permits that we have in the past — and that’s equally as damaging.”</p>
<p>As <a href="https://heatmap.news/am/revolution-wind-court-order"><u>I reported last month</u></a> in this newsletter, a federal judge blocked Trump’s stop-work order on the 80% complete wind farm off Rhode Island’s coast. But the administration’s multi-agency onslaught against the offshore wind industry, which <a href="https://heatmap.news/energy/trump-wind-total-war"><u>Heatmap’s Jael Holzman called</u></a> a “total war,” is already taking a toll. Danish wind giant Orsted, for example, was forced to raise money via an unusual offering of new shares — which it then sold at a nearly <a href="https://heatmap.news/am/orsted-shares-discount"><u>70% discount</u></a>.</p>
<h3>2. Trump leverages Chicago transit money, FEMA grants amid shutdown</h3>
<p>The Trump administration said Friday it would delay $2.1 billion in funding for transit projects in Chicago amid negotiations with Democrats in Congress to approve a federal budget. The move comes after Russ Vought, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, announced cuts to major New York City infrastructure projects, in what <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-shutdown-new-york"><u>Heatmap’s Matthew Zeitlin interpreted</u></a> as Trump’s “seeking retribution from New Yorkers” for the ongoing government shutdown, since Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries both hail from the city.</p>
<p>The Federal Emergency Management Agency, meanwhile, is withholding more than $300 million in emergency preparedness grants from states until they can prove that the population estimates used to calculate the funding awards do not include people who have been deported as part of the administration’s immigration crackdown. A group representing state emergency management agencies called the move “a never-before-seen provision” that amounts to “further delaying resources intended to strengthen disaster preparedness and emergency response,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/03/climate/fema-emergency-grants-immigration-population.html"><u><em><em>The New York Times</em></em></u></a> reported Friday.</p>
<h3>3. U.S. regulators approve production of higher-enriched uranium fuel</h3>
<p>The Nuclear Regulatory Commission gave fuel giant Urenco’s U.S. subsidiary the green light last week to produce reactor pellets enriched with up to double the normal concentration of uranium-235. This past spring, the utility giant Southern Company <a href="https://fortune.com/2025/06/12/southern-next-gen-nuclear-fuel-history-georgia/"><u>made history</u></a> by loading one of the older reactors at the nation’s most powerful nuclear station in Georgia with what’s known as LEU+, a version of low-enriched uranium that goes beyond the roughly 5% enrichment limit regulators typically set for the fuel. Uranium enriched up to 10% with U-235, the fissile isotope that can produce energy through atom-splitting, leaves behind less waste and can keep a reactor going for longer. In a <a href="https://www.urenco.com/news/global/2025/urenco-usa-authorised-to-produce-up-to-10-enriched-uranium-by-nrc"><u>press release</u></a>, Urenco said the federal permit to produce LEU+ at its Eunice plant in New Mexico “will create new opportunities for the current U.S. reactor fleet by allowing for longer operating cycles and fewer refueling outages.”</p>
<h3>4. Elon Musk gambles billions on Memphis AI data complex</h3>
<p>Elon Musk will need to spend at least $18 billion to buy roughly 300,000 more Nvidia microchips to complete his sprawling Memphis data center complex, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/elon-musk-xai-memphis-tennessee-power-dec4c70d"><em><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></em></a> reported Sunday. The project, called Colossus, has a colossal appetite for electricity. In July, Musk <a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/elon-musks-xai-buys-former-gas-power-plant-site-in-southaven-mississippi/">bought a former gas plant</a> in Mississippi. In August, green groups accused xAI of <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/28/musk-xai-accused-of-worsening-memphis-smog-with-unauthorized-turbines.html">violating federal air pollution rules</a> with its use of gas-fired turbines to power its servers. The federally owned Tennessee Valley Authority’s aggressive push to build more nuclear reactors is often discussed as a means of supplying Musk’s demand with cleaner power, but those projects are still years away from producing electrons.</p>
<p>Over the course of one year, Musk’s xAI has surged to become the second-largest taxpayer in the Tennessee county, after FedEx, as the company burns through cash at what the newspaper called “a breakneck clip.” Earlier this year, xAI raised $10 billion through a combination of debt and equity, and its billionaire founder has turned to his privately held SpaceX to chip in $2 billion. “In typical xAI and Elon fashion, the company’s future is highly unpredictable,” Dylan Patel, chief executive of the semiconductor and artificial intelligence research firm SemiAnalysis, told the <em><em>Journal</em></em>. “Elon will do everything he can to not lose to Sam Altman.” He’s struggling. On Monday morning, Altman’s OpenAI inked a deal to buy chips from AMD, just weeks after signing a $100 billion agreement with Nvidia, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/06/technology/openai-amd-chips.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&amp;referringSource=articleShare"><em><em>The New York Times</em></em></a> reported.</p>
<h3>5. Japan delays offshore wind pricing plan </h3>
<p>Japan last week “delayed indefinitely” an auction to set government funding levels for offshore wind projects in what <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-03/japan-delays-offshore-wind-pricing-bid-in-green-push-setback?srnd=phx-green&amp;embedded-checkout=true"><u><em><em>Bloomberg</em></em></u></a> called “the latest blow to the country’s push to expand renewable energy supplies.” The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry put the auction, which had been scheduled to start on October 14 and run for two weeks, on hold to give officials time to reassess the effects of higher interest rates and rising material costs. In August, Japanese industrial giant Mitsubishi Corp. announced its withdrawal from several projects won via a previous auction, citing escalating construction costs.</p>
<p>Scientists have long wondered when and how otophysans, the supergroup of fish that accounts for two-thirds of all freshwater fish and includes catfish, carps, and tetras, evolved to live outside saltwater oceans. A fossil of a tiny fish found in southwestern Alberta has provided some answers. The four-centimeter specimen from the Late Cretaceous period — between 100.5 million and 66 million years ago, when the iconic Tyrannosaurus Rex lived — showed the distinct first four vertebrae that otophysans evolved to transmit vibrations to the ear from the swim bladder. The discovery of the species, named Acronichthys maccognoi, “fills a gap in our record of the otophysans supergroup,” Neil Banerjee, a Western University scientist and co-author of the study, said in a <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1100199"><u>press release</u></a>. “<strong>It is the oldest North America member of the group and provides incredible data to help document the origin and early evolution of so many freshwater fish living today.</strong>”</p>
