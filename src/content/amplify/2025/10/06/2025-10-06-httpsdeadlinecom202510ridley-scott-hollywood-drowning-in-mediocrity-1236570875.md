<p><a data-tag="ridley-scott" href="https://deadline.com/tag/ridley-scott/">Ridley Scott</a>, a filmmaker not known for pulling his punches, has issued a withering assessment on the health of Hollywood output right now.</p>
<p>The <em><a data-tag="gladiator" href="https://deadline.com/tag/gladiator/">Gladiator</a></em> and <em>Blade Runner</em> director argued that the industry is “drowning in mediocrity.” So much so, Scott revealed that he has taken to re-watching his old films.</p>
<p>Scott made the comments during an interview reflecting on his career at BFI Southbank in London on Sunday. <a data-id="https://metro.co.uk/2025/10/05/sir-ridley-scott-declares-most-films-made-today-s-t-24347226/" data-type="link" href="https://metro.co.uk/2025/10/05/sir-ridley-scott-declares-most-films-made-today-s-t-24347226/">Metro</a> and <a data-id="https://uk.movies.yahoo.com/ridley-scott-fears-hollywood-is-drowning-in-mediocrity-181520498.html" data-type="link" href="https://uk.movies.yahoo.com/ridley-scott-fears-hollywood-is-drowning-in-mediocrity-181520498.html">Yahoo!</a> were among those reporting the Oscar-nominated director’s remarks.</p>
<p>“The quantity of movies that are made today, literally globally – millions. Not thousands, millions… and most of it is s**t,” he said. Scott added that films are too often “saved” by digital effects because they haven’t got a “great thing on paper first.”</p>
<p>Asked if he has a go-to comfort movie, the British director said: “Well, actually, right now, I’m finding mediocrity – we’re drowning in mediocrity. And so what I do – it’s a horrible thing – but I’ve started watching my own movies, and actually they’re pretty good! And also, they don’t age.”</p>
<p>“I watched <em>Black Hawk</em> [<em>Down</em>] the other night and I thought, ‘How in the hell did I manage to do that?’ But I think occasionally a good one will happen, [and] it’s like a relief that there’s somebody out there who’s doing a good movie.”</p>
<p>Having wrapped <em><a data-tag="the-dog-stars" href="https://deadline.com/tag/the-dog-stars/">The Dog Stars</a></em>, Scott revealed a little more about his plans for <em>Gladiator 3</em>. “He’s around and he technically is the Emperor of Rome, and so I have a footprint about what I think it should be,” he explained.</p>
<p>Scott wasn’t the only one to bemoan the quality of film output in recent days. In an appearance on <em><a href="https://deadline.com/tag/hot-ones/">Hot Ones</a>, </em><a data-id="https://deadline.com/2025/10/channing-tatum-hollywood-confused-pipeline-bad-movies-1236570679/#comments" data-type="link" href="https://deadline.com/2025/10/channing-tatum-hollywood-confused-pipeline-bad-movies-1236570679/#comments">Channing Tatum said</a>: “When you get asked to do a movie, or you’re trying to get a movie made, it’s a very confused pipeline of possibilities, and it really feels like, at times, that you’re incentivized to make bad things to get paid, rather than make something really, really good.”</p>
