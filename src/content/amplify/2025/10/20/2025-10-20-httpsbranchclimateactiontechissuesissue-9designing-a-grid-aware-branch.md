title: Designing a Grid-Aware Branch
---
<p><em>Branch</em> launched five years ago, and if you’ve been following along, you may have noticed that issue 9 arrives with a fresh site redesign. This new design builds on valuable feedback we’ve received from you, our community, and some brand-new ideas we’ve been exploring as part of the Green Web Foundation’s <a href="https://www.thegreenwebfoundation.org/tools/grid-aware-websites/">Grid-aware Websites</a> project.</p>
<p><em>Branch</em>‘s initial design set out to creatively explore how we could link a digital experience to the realities of the physical world. We experimented with reflecting the fossil-fuel powered pieces of the physical infrastructure of the internet and introduced <a href="https://branch.climateaction.tech/issues/issue-1/designing-branch-sustainable-interaction-design-principles/">Sustainable Interaction Design Principles</a> in <em>Branch’s </em>inaugural issue.</p>
<p>Fast forward to 2025 and the new era of AI-driven everything. Rapidly expanding data centers and computation demands are hammering finite resources like fossil fuels, water, land, and minerals at an unprecendented rate. But still, many users and advocates for these technologies don’t recognize these harms.</p>
<p>We believe it’s more urgent than ever to help users understand the digital world in the physical realities of what’s actually happening.</p>
<p>One of the practices we’re moved to embrace for super-charging this perception is grid-aware.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Grid-aware is the idea of making something digital detect the electricity grid around it, and depending on what’s happening, adjust that digital thing’s behavior to have a beneficial impact rather than a negative one.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>These adjustments can be responding to the carbon emissions arising from the electricity grid at a moment in time, or to other grid factors such as demand peaks and resilience needs. The idea is to holistically consider the electricity grid that digital thing is operating within, and look for opportunities where it can help, rather than harm, that grid. This holistic view is vital to avoid a <a href="https://www.thegreenwebfoundation.org/news/drawing-a-diagram-to-show-the-scope-of-climate-justice/#bonus-finds">carbon tunnel vision</a> problem.</p>
<p>For this<em> Branch</em> redesign, we riffed on this wider <a href="https://github.com/climateaction-tech/grid-aware-software">grid-aware concept</a> to develop an experimental practice for websites to attune to the grid around it. Our aim has been to create a deeper connection to the physical resource use behind a digital experience in the user’s mind. We also wanted to show this approach doesn’t have to mean drastically sacrificing the design or user experience.</p>
<ol> <li>Work out the rough geographical location of a user.</li> <li>Find out how clean or dirty the user’s local electricity grid is.</li> <li>Alter the site’s behavior to different modes to represent this.</li> </ol>
<p>In our implementation, some modes have a happy by-product of lowering the energy demand on a user’s device. This can make the site more accessible to people on slower internet connections or lower-spec / older devices too.</p>
<p>Key to creating this user awareness is the grid-aware status bar that sits on top of the site. Its core feature is to connect the user’s location to the electricity grid powering their device, and indicating how clean or fossil-fuel-heavy that energy is.</p>
<figure><img alt="Grid-aware websites component feature - moderate mode" sizes="auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src="https://branch.climateaction.tech/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Grid-aware-websites-component-feature-moderate.jpg" srcset="https://branch.climateaction.tech/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Grid-aware-websites-component-feature-moderate.jpg 900w, https://branch.climateaction.tech/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Grid-aware-websites-component-feature-moderate-300x47.jpg 300w, https://branch.climateaction.tech/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Grid-aware-websites-component-feature-moderate-768x120.jpg 768w"/><figcaption>Grid-aware websites component feature - moderate mode</figcaption></figure>
<p>This live indicator, and the overall grid-aware design implementation on <em>Branch</em>, is powered by an <a href="https://developers.thegreenwebfoundation.org/grid-aware-websites/overview/">open-source toolkit</a> which provides a web component you can drop into your site. Behind the scenes, this component uses an API from data provider <a href="https://electricitymaps.com/">Electricity Maps</a>. This API provides a <em>high</em>, <em>moderate</em>, or <em>low</em> signal reflecting the current carbon intensity of a location’s energy grid compared to a rolling 10-day average.</p>
<p>The high, moderate, and low status is determined by the following thresholds:</p>
<ul> <li><strong>Low</strong>: 15% below average (ratio &lt; 0.85)</li> <li><strong>Moderate</strong>: between 15% below and 15% above average (0.85 ≤ ratio ≤ 1.15)</li> <li><strong>High</strong>: 15% above average (ratio &gt; 1.15)</li> </ul>
<p>More information about the <a href="https://portal.electricitymaps.com/developer-hub/api/reference#latest-carbon-intensity-level">Carbon Intensity Level API</a> can be found on the Electricity Maps website.</p>
<p><em>Branch </em>adapts in real time to the carbon footprint of the user’s local energy grid. Whenever you visit, you’ll experience one of four distinct design states:</p>
<ol> <li>Default mode</li> <li>Cleaner than average – low intensity mode</li> <li>Near average emissions – moderate intensity mode</li> <li>Dirtier than average – high intensity mode</li> </ol>
<p>When first arriving at the site, the user is presented with the <em>default</em> state. This means you’re seeing the site in its natural state with no changes. The background shifts to grey, and images and videos are automatically shown. The user can opt-in to see the site in grid-aware mode through using the options at the top, and <a href="https://branch.climateaction.tech/issues/issue-9/designing-a-grid-aware-branch/#user-choice">more user-choice below</a>. This view is also used when carbon data can’t be fetched – whether due to API outages, connectivity issues, or other technical hiccups. It reminds us that our digital experiences rely on technology and physical infrastructure, which can and does fail.</p>
<figure><img alt="Screenshot of Branch's about page in default grid-aware mode" sizes="auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src="https://branch.climateaction.tech/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Branch-default-intensity-mode.jpg" srcset="https://branch.climateaction.tech/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Branch-default-intensity-mode.jpg 900w, https://branch.climateaction.tech/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Branch-default-intensity-mode-300x177.jpg 300w, https://branch.climateaction.tech/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Branch-default-intensity-mode-768x452.jpg 768w"/><figcaption>Screenshot of Branch's about page in default grid-aware mode</figcaption></figure>
<p>When the user’s grid has a higher share of renewable energy and fewer fossil fuels than average, the site turns green and delivers the full experience with all images, videos and media loaded by default. We also load a custom font, Inter.</p>
<figure><img alt="Screenshot of Branch's about page in low intensity grid-aware mode" sizes="auto, (max-width: 2528px) 100vw, 2528px" src="https://branch.climateaction.tech/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Branch-low-intensity-mode.jpg" srcset="https://branch.climateaction.tech/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Branch-low-intensity-mode.jpg 2528w, https://branch.climateaction.tech/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Branch-low-intensity-mode-300x176.jpg 300w, https://branch.climateaction.tech/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Branch-low-intensity-mode-1024x601.jpg 1024w, https://branch.climateaction.tech/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Branch-low-intensity-mode-768x451.jpg 768w, https://branch.climateaction.tech/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Branch-low-intensity-mode-1536x902.jpg 1536w, https://branch.climateaction.tech/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Branch-low-intensity-mode-2048x1202.jpg 2048w"/><figcaption>Screenshot of Branch's about page in low intensity grid-aware mode</figcaption></figure>
<p>If the user’s local grid emissions are around average, the site switches to an orange background and displays compressed, lighter versions of images and videos.</p>
<figure><img alt="Screenshot of Branch's about page in medium intensity grid-aware mode" sizes="auto, (max-width: 2534px) 100vw, 2534px" src="https://branch.climateaction.tech/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Branch-medium-intensity-mode.jpg" srcset="https://branch.climateaction.tech/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Branch-medium-intensity-mode.jpg 2534w, https://branch.climateaction.tech/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Branch-medium-intensity-mode-300x177.jpg 300w, https://branch.climateaction.tech/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Branch-medium-intensity-mode-1024x603.jpg 1024w, https://branch.climateaction.tech/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Branch-medium-intensity-mode-768x452.jpg 768w, https://branch.climateaction.tech/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Branch-medium-intensity-mode-1536x904.jpg 1536w, https://branch.climateaction.tech/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Branch-medium-intensity-mode-2048x1206.jpg 2048w"/><figcaption>Screenshot of Branch's about page in medium intensity grid-aware mode</figcaption></figure>
<p>When the local grid relies more heavily on fossil fuels, the background turns red and we reverse the way media is shown. Instead of automatically loading media, we emphasize descriptive alt text, giving users the option to click to reveal images or videos. This approach encourages writing more meaningful alt texts and uses system fonts to further reduce energy demands.</p>
<figure><img alt="Screenshot of Branch's about page in high intensity grid-aware mode" sizes="auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src="https://branch.climateaction.tech/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Branch-high-intensity-mode.jpg" srcset="https://branch.climateaction.tech/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Branch-high-intensity-mode.jpg 900w, https://branch.climateaction.tech/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Branch-high-intensity-mode-300x176.jpg 300w, https://branch.climateaction.tech/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Branch-high-intensity-mode-768x451.jpg 768w"/><figcaption>Screenshot of Branch's about page in high intensity grid-aware mode</figcaption></figure>
<p>When a person visits <em>Branch</em> for the first time, they will see the <strong>default view</strong> described above. This means that rather than being applied automatically, we allow users to opt-in to applying grid-aware changes to the website. To enable this, we have included a ‘Grid-aware mode’ toggle in the status bar at the top of the site. This is a nod to the now common dark mode switches you see on other sites.</p>
<figure><img alt="Grid-aware component bar in default mode" sizes="auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src="https://branch.climateaction.tech/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Grid-aware-websites-component-feature-default-mode.jpg" srcset="https://branch.climateaction.tech/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Grid-aware-websites-component-feature-default-mode.jpg 900w, https://branch.climateaction.tech/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Grid-aware-websites-component-feature-default-mode-300x51.jpg 300w, https://branch.climateaction.tech/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Grid-aware-websites-component-feature-default-mode-768x131.jpg 768w"/><figcaption>Grid-aware component bar in default mode</figcaption></figure>
<p>A person visiting <em>Branch</em> for the first time will see the ‘Grid-aware mode’ toggle set to an off position. Next to that, they will be presented with buttons allowing them to select the different views – low, moderate, and high – depicted in the image above. This allows users to manually select a mode to view the website in, or they can alternately continue to view the site in the default mode.</p>
<p>By switching the ‘Grid-aware mode’ toggle into the ‘auto’ position, users can also opt-in to having a grid-aware design automatically applied to the site as they browse. In this state, we use a Cloudflare Worker running code from our Grid-aware Websites project to make modifications to the website HTML before the page is returned to a user’s browser. The changes that are made are based on the current grid intensity of the user’s local energy grid, based on data that is provided by the Electricity Maps API we touched on earlier. The code that does all that can be <a href="https://github.com/thegreenwebfoundation/branch-gaw-worker">found on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>Although <em>Branch </em>is a WordPress website, our grid-aware status bar is a standalone web component that can be used on any site. Explore the <a href="https://github.com/thegreenwebfoundation/gaw-web-component">project code</a> and usage guides on GitHub as part of the open-source Grid-aware Websites toolkit, or install via the <a href="https://github.com/thegreenwebfoundation/gaw-plugin-cloudflare-workers/tree/use-levels-api">Grid-aware Websites Cloudflare Workers plugin</a>, which requires a single configuration option.</p>
<p>Beyond its grid responsiveness, the <em>Branch</em> site has also been designed to consume as little energy as possible by reducing image weight, minimizing JavaScript, refreshing the color palettes, and utilizing system fonts during high-carbon periods.</p>
<p>Some <em>Branch</em> articles include embedded content like YouTube videos and PDFs. In these cases, we have taken steps to reduce the size of these embeds where possible. For YouTube videos, we replace the regular YouTube embed with a <a href="https://github.com/justinribeiro/lite-youtube">Lite YouTube Embed web component</a> in the <strong>cleaner than average </strong>and <strong>near average</strong> views. This presents a static image and play icon, and only downloads content from YouTube (without cookies) when the user interacts with the video element. During high-carbon periods, the YouTube element is replaced with a placeholder similar to that used for images on the website which guides the user to watching the video on YouTube if they wish to do so.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, for embedded PDF content, we use a WordPress plugin to display PDFs in an article in the <strong>cleaner than average </strong>and <strong>near average</strong> views. A link to download the PDF is also included below the embed for users who wish to view to the content at a later time. During high-carbon periods, the PDF embed is removed from the article entirely, with only the link to download the PDF remaining in place for the user.</p>
<p>We hope this redesign sparks greater awareness of sustainable digital design and inspires new ideas and experiments that prove we can provide a good user experience, while accounting for the internet’s physical impact.
