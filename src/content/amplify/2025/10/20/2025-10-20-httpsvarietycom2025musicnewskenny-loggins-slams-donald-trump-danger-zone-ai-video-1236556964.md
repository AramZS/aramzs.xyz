<p><a data-tag="kenny-loggins" href="https://variety.com/t/kenny-loggins/">Kenny Loggins</a> has spoken out against Donald <a data-tag="trump" href="https://variety.com/t/trump/">Trump</a> using his song “Danger Zone” in a <a href="https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/trump-ai-video-no-kings-fighter-jet-brown-sludge-protestors-1236556347/">bizarre AI video</a> of the president in a fighter jet bombing No Kings protesters with what appears to be fecal matter.</p>
<p>“This is an unauthorized use of my performance of ‘Danger Zone.’ Nobody asked me for my permission, which I would have denied, and I request that my recording on this video is removed immediately,” Loggins said in a statement shared with <em>Variety</em> on Monday.</p>
<p>“I can’t imagine why anybody would want their music used or associated with something created with the sole purpose of dividing us. Too many people are trying to tear us apart, and we need to find new ways to come together,” Loggins continued. “We’re all Americans, and we’re all patriotic. There is no ‘us and them’ — that’s not who we are, nor is it what we should be. It’s all of us. We’re in this together, and it is my hope that we can embrace music as a way of celebrating and uniting each and every one of us.”</p>
<p>Loggins’ “Danger Zone” was famously used in the 1986 Tom Cruise film “Top Gun,” which is what Trump’s AI video seems to be paying homage to. It’s one of Loggins’ most beloved tracks, alongside “Footloose” from the 1984 movie of the same name.</p>
<p>According to CNN, nearly 7 million people participated in more than 2,700 “No Kings” protests in all 50 states on Saturday to show their disapproval of Trump’s administration. Celebrities like Mark Ruffalo, Jimmy Kimmel, Robert De Niro and Glenn Close all <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/jimmy-kimmel-robert-de-niro-glenn-close-no-kings-protests-1236556296/">spoke out in support</a> of the protests.</p>
<p>“The original No Kings protest was 250 years ago,” De Niro said. “Americans decided they didn’t want to live under the rule of King George III. They declared their independence and fought a bloody war for democracy. We’ve had two and a half centuries of democracy since then. Often challenging, sometimes messy, always essential.”</p>
<p>He continued, “Now we have a would-be king who wants to take it away: King Donald the First. Fuck that. We’re rising up again, this time, nonviolently raising our voices to declare: No Kings.”</p>
