<p><strong>Autumn has fully arrived in Minneapolis, where I live, bringing with it all the trappings of the season: sweater weather and pumpkins on front porches and the smell of a bonfire drifting through the early-evening air. </strong>It’s a time of coziness and community with a wistful, nostalgic edge as we gather outside one last time and run through a checklist of comforting things to do before the isolating months of winter.</p>
<p>I was pondering that list the other day as I waited outside my daughter’s recorder class, going through a mental inventory of autumn activities we could or should do to Make Family Memories.</p>
<p>Eat caramel apples? Check, already done. Hay ride? Maybe; I need to Google the options. <em>Haunted </em>hayride? Nah. Halloween? Yes, obviously, but we still have to nail down all the details, including stocking up on candy and making a costume based on (if you have kids, you know where this is going in 2025) a character from “K-Pop Demon Hunters.”</p>
<p>Somehow, as all the seasonal associations pinballed around my brain, I ended up on pumpkin spice lattes. I’ve never had one, I realized—and it also struck me that they’re the only marker of autumn that doesn’t trigger any childhood memories for me. We didn’t have them back then. For that matter, back in my day—and you should read this whole sentence in an old-man voice—in the 1980s, we barely had pumpkin spice <em>anything</em>.</p>
<p>My focus suddenly narrowed, lasering on a single question I’d never thought to ask: What’s the story with pumpkin spice?</p>
<p>How is that, in the course of the last couple of decades, we’ve gone from almost nothing prominent in this category to an annual explosion of new products that <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/laneelee-1/2025/09/15/25-shocking-pumpkin-spice-products-and-where-to-buy-them/">multiple publications round up the most notable ones every September</a>? And, perhaps most of all, how did it <em>start</em>?</p>
<p>I got out my phone and started poking around for more information, figuring I’d kill some time while my seven-year-old practiced “Golden” in the other room. I didn’t expect much—maybe some corporate history from Starbucks, blah blah blah. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pumpkin_spice_latte">That’s what the Wikipedia page says.</a></p>
<p>But, as always with these food research excursions, I quickly fell down a rabbit hole.</p>
<p>The recorder lesson ended. We went home. And then I stayed up way too late, after my kids were in bed, looking for more and more information, because things had already gotten <em>weird</em>, with twists and turns and celebrity cameos and a clear indication that the existing mythology was very, very wrong.</p>
<p><a href="https://about.starbucks.com/stories/2023/psl-turns-20-the-story-behind-starbucks-pumpkin-spice-latte/">This is the origin story of the pumpkin spice latte (I refuse to capitalize it), according to Starbucks:</a></p>
<blockquote> <p>It’s hard to imagine the arrival of autumn without the cozy comfort of a Starbucks Pumpkin Spice Latte. But 20 years ago, pumpkin spice and fall hadn’t found each other yet. <a href="https://about.starbucks.com/stories/2022/starbucks-peppermint-mocha-a-love-story/">Peppermint Mocha</a> was Starbucks first blockbuster seasonal beverage the winter before and the company hoped to create another hit for the autumn season. Peter Dukes, who led the Starbucks espresso beverage team at the time, remembers working with the team to create the company’s first fall beverage. </p> <p>“We started with a huge brainstorm list and filled the wall with ideas,” Dukes said. “We probably had at least a hundred ideas up on the wall. And once we got those ideas, we started to whittle away at them and came down to a list of about 20 different flavors including chocolate and caramel – the most popular flavors to pair with coffee – and there was orange and cinnamon … and there was pumpkin there as well.” </p> <p>On an early spring day in 2003, the team gathered in the “Liquid Lab,” a secure research and development space on the 7th floor of Starbucks headquarters in Seattle. Members of the team brought in kitschy fall decorations and pumpkin pies and began to explore ideas. They would sample a forkful of pumpkin pie followed by a sip of hot espresso – teasing out which flavors from the pie best complemented the coffee. </p> <p>For the next three months, the team refined the recipe, handcrafted with espresso, pumpkin spice sauce, and steamed milk – topped off with whipped cream and a dash of pumpkin pie topping. In a taste test alongside the chocolate and caramel beverages, pumpkin was the clear winner. Next, they just needed a name.</p> <p>“There was a desire to choose a really unique name, such as the fall harvest latte,” said Dukes. “We ultimately ended up landing on Pumpkin Spice Latte because the spices play a really important role in bringing out the flavors of pumpkin, while also highlighting the espresso in the cup.” </p> </blockquote>
<p>Long sigh. Okay. First things first: this is so damn corporate. Does no one know how to tell a soft-touch story anymore?</p>
<p>I almost give them credit for not inventing a whole fake persona around it, like Betty Crocker, but it’s still jarring to hear a huge company go, “Yeah, our signature cozy-season product was just one of many concepts we dreamed up in our high-rise headquarters. Guess it worked out, though!”</p>
<p>But it’s not just kinda cold and calculated. The narrative is also wrong. Willfully incorrect from the second sentence.</p>
<p>Pumpkin spice, as a concept, has existed for more than a century, and has been linked to autumn for nearly as long.</p>
<p>I was able to figure this out in just a few minutes of scrolling on my phone, and I have to say that it bugged me to see the ease of the effort and how quickly it was apparent that Starbucks was being disingenuous. Saying that pumpkin spice and autumn “found each other” in 2003 is like claiming that Cookie Monster just recently, by random chance, developed an interest in baked goods.</p>
<p>The earliest reference to pumpkin spice that I found was a recommendation, from 1913, that if you want pumpkin pie but don’t have the main ingredient, <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/article/daily-drovers-journal-stockman-pumpkin/183351544/">just use carrot and pumpkin pie spices and it’ll taste the same</a>. In another article, from October 1915, the <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-berlin-news-record-pumpkin-pie-needs/183353728/">writer suggested that a pumpkin pie without the signature flavors would be</a> “Such heresy! It is the spice that gives zest to the entire compound!”—a clear signal that a blend of cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and ginger has long been understood and appreciated as pumpkin (pie) spice.</p>
<p>The recipe hasn’t changed much over the years, aside from ratios, and by the 1930s, demand was such that companies started selling pumpkin pie spice as a prepackaged mix. Here’s just one of those products, advertised in autumn 1932:</p>
<figure><img alt="" data-attachment-id="139903387" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-caption="" data-image-description="" data-image-meta='{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}' data-image-title="image" data-large-file="https://snackstack.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-2.png?w=448" data-medium-file="https://snackstack.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-2.png?w=200" data-orig-file="https://snackstack.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-2.png" data-orig-size="448,671" data-permalink="https://snackstack.net/2025/10/21/the-curious-contentious-history-of-pumpkin-spice-lattes/image-218/" sizes="(max-width: 448px) 100vw, 448px" src="https://snackstack.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-2.png" srcset="https://snackstack.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-2.png 448w, https://snackstack.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-2.png?w=100 100w, https://snackstack.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-2.png?w=200 200w"/></figure>
<p>Having a little container of this mix in the house was convenient for making pumpkin pies, but it also proved tempting for other baking efforts. It’s right there on the shelf, after all, so why not add a little shake to your muffins or cakes or what-have-you?</p>
<p>This is where pumpkin spice truly came into its own, some 90 years ago. Among many other examples, I found <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-niles-daily-star-pumpkin-spice-layer/183354012/">pumpkin spice layer cake featured on a menu in October 1936</a>, and the same product in newspaper ads and recipes throughout the 1930s, 40s, and 50s, around the USA. Nearly all of these mentions appeared in the autumn months, and plenty of them made the connection explicit, <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/503635123/?match=1&amp;clipping_id=183354097">like an ad from Hazleton, Pennsylvania in 1953</a> that touted pumpkin spice layer cake as an essential part of a Halloween party.</p>
<p>If pumpkin spice was common enough in those years, it officially hit mainstream popularity in 1964, when it was the not-so-secret ingredient in <a href="https://www.pillsbury.com/recipes/peacheesy-pie/e2fe3f73-84c4-4325-927e-d72ae5efb67c">the <em>peach </em>pie recipe that won the Pillsbury Bake-Off</a>. This new moment in the spotlight launched <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/article/freeport-journal-standard-pumpkin-spice/183354978/">a hundred explanatory articles and trend pieces for anyone who may have previously been unaware of pumpkin spice:</a></p>

<p>At this point, I was getting genuinely annoyed with Starbucks, but I could also hear its executives and loyalists grumbling that, well, <em>None of these recipes are lattes or coffee or even beverages</em>.</p>
<p>We’re getting there; the pieces are coming together. The other key component, of course, is the rise of gourmet coffee in the USA. I’m not going to rehash that whole story, but <a href="https://pdx.eater.com/22436234/history-coffee-pacific-northwest-portland-seattle">I will point you to this excellent <em>Eater </em>article on the subject, with a specific focus on Starbucks’ hometown of Seattle</a>. The boom there began in 1975 at a place called Allegro, which was, uh, <em>inspirational</em>, per <em>Eater</em>:</p>
<blockquote> <p>Howard Schultz, in his 1997 book<em> Pour Your Heart Into It</em>, cops to basing much of the Starbucks cafe model off Allegro’s early vibe, which fused the European cafe tradition of the “third place” with something distinctively American in its informality and uniquely Seattle in its approach to the rhythms of urban life.</p> </blockquote>
<p>By the early 1990s, coffee culture as we know it had begun to spread beyond Seattle. (This occurred in parallel with broader changes in the American food landscape; I highly recommend <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/89545/the-united-states-of-arugula-by-david-kamp/">David Kamp’s book <em>The United States of Arugula</em></a> for those details.) Newspapers around the country, from <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/article/spokane-chronicle-coffee-explainer/183355377/">Spokane</a> to <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-philadelphia-inquirer-coffee-explai/183355398/">Philadelphia</a>, wrote long trend pieces with sidebars explaining the differences between a mocha and a latte, and noting that “expresso” is not the correct spelling.</p>
<p>The coffee snob was starting to become an American archetype—and all those new fans were slowly starting to change the product itself.</p>
<p>Culinary traditions are constantly shifting. There’s a long list of foods that many people mistakenly believe to have originated in one country but are, in fact, riffs and variations introduced by immigrants adapting to the audiences and ingredients of their new home; these include, for example, <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/chicken-tikka-masala">chicken tikka masala (first served in Scotland)</a>, <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/chop-suey-american-classic-180964610/#:~:text=It's%20a%20Chinese%2DAmerican%20dish,anthropologist%20Bennet%20Bronson%20told%20Eng.">chop suey (USA)</a>, and <a href="https://www.kqed.org/news/11695791/the-fishy-origins-of-cioppino">cioppino (USA).</a> All build on centuries-old traditions but are unequivocally reflections of their own time and place. The great beauty and frustration of cultural authenticity is that it’s always a moving target.</p>
<p>As coffee culture spread around the United States, baristas adapted the old ways to their modern customer base. New variations emerged, many of which would make Italians balk but were a hit with Americans opening their wallets, especially those who cared less about process and tradition than just having a tasty pick-me-up.</p>
<p>In Massachusetts, a small chain called Coffee Connection started making something it branded the Frappuccino, arguably USA’s first big contribution to (or degradation of) gourmet coffee. By this point, Starbucks was already taking over the national landscape, and when it bought out Coffee Connection <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frappuccino">it also claimed the signature drink as its own, and rolled it out nationwide in 1995</a>. (Thanks to <a href="https://www.bonappetit.com/contributor/jesse-raub?srsltid=AfmBOoro80ohw3xmKKJ1srPCbiICLFxG7C8QyTb50cwecbo6SQ8qysCd">food writer Jesse Raub</a> for pointing me to this anecdote.)</p>
<p>Elsewhere, shops experimented with different kinds of roasts, beans from different parts of the world, and novel flavors that might appeal to new customers. In the clips below, you can see several examples, including banana-nut-bread coffee in <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/article/news-press-pumpkin-spice-coffee/183356452/">Fort Meyers, Florida</a> in 1993 (first clip) and Irish cream coffee in Kokomo, Indiana in 1996 (second clip). You’ll also notice some yellow highlights relevant to our investigation.</p>

<p>Again: there are lots of examples of this. All available evidence indicates that pumpkin-spice-flavored coffee was relatively common around the USA in the mid-1990s. Most of the references I found were from small towns, and most of <em>those </em>were in the Midwest, especially Indiana.</p>
<p>I’ve been trying to make sense of this and I’ve come up with a theory. Coffee shops in the big cities like Seattle were focused more on emulating the authentic European versions, fussing over every last detail, because that’s the cosmopolitan experience their customers craved. In small towns, baristas had a different audience with different expectations, which meant they had to innovate to build an audience. The flavors leaned toward familiar baking traditions like gingerbread, banana bread, and pumpkin pie, or classic holiday tastes like eggnog or peppermint. They tapped into an evocative sense of nostalgia and celebration.</p>
<p>Put another way: before pumpkin spice coffee became a nationwide trend, it was essentially small-town kitsch, the sort of thing your grandma might try (or dream up herself) at a café attached to a gift <em>shoppe </em>on Main Street.</p>
<p>Hold that thought for just a minute, because there’s an important sidebar that I need to mention.</p>
<p>My hunch is that one of those shops offering pumpkin spice coffee <em>must </em>be the first place to sell pumpkin spice lattes. All the other pieces are there; someone must have put them together. But I struggled to find concrete evidence for this, no matter how deep I went in my research.</p>
<p>For one thing, not every menu item is preserved in print (or memory). For another, there was the issue of what to call the drink in the first place. Before everyone settled on the precise name “pumpkin spice latte,” there were other terms for the same thing, including “pumpkin pie spice latte” or just “pumpkin delight.”</p>
<p>As I was toying with different search phrases and going back through the years, my eyes starting to cross from scrolling through the results and scanning endless pages, I came across <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-rocket-tori-amos-pumpkin-spice-latt/183078386/">an interview with the singer Tori Amos, published in the Seattle alt-weekly <em>The Rocket</em> in 1994</a>.</p>
<p>The image is grainy (you can see it in the link above), so I’ll just print the text. Here’s how the article begins:</p>
<blockquote> <p>Tori Amos has an idea. But not an idea for a song—a new drink. Returning to Seattle for her second visit this year, Amos is eager to find an audience for her latest experiment in beverage concoction. “You have all your Starbucks things,” she says. “Well, I have one that tastes like pumpkin pie. It’s my own invention; it’s my contribution to Halloween. A little witch warmer!”</p> <p>Amos’ more ardent fans would probably say she hardly needs to resort to creating pumpkin lattes to bewitch a crowd. </p> </blockquote>
<p>That’s notable! She doesn’t call it a “pumpkin spice latte” specifically, but it’s all <em>so close</em>. Piecing the quote together with what we know about pumpkin pie spice and how it was used, I’m willing to give her the benefit of the doubt. The skeptic in me thinks this can’t possibly be true, but the researcher in me actually feels fairly confident in saying this: it sure looks like Tori Amos created the first known pumpkin spice latte.</p>
<p>(I emailed her team with some questions but never heard back, even after <a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2326895/did-tori-amos-invent-the-pumpkin-spice-latte/news/"><em>Stereogum </em>published a story based on my excited Bluesky posts about my research</a>. Obviously, I would <em>love </em>to confirm all this and if I get any more details, I’ll update this post accordingly. It’s also worth noting that <em>Stereogum </em>offers up a fun anecdote about Kenny G. being maybe possibly involved in the Frappuccino, but I genuinely don’t have the energy to go down <em>that </em>particular rabbit hole; the day only has 24 hours.)</p>
<p>I do not know what to do with that, to be honest. It’s fascinating and important as a standalone data point, but it doesn’t fit into the broader narrative of pumpkin spice, lattes or otherwise, and I really cannot overemphasize the fact that other people <em>probably </em>came up with the pumpkin spice latte before Amos or around the same time, but we just don’t have documentation of it.</p>
<p>Given that the interview appeared in a Seattle publication and included a specific contrast with Starbucks, it’s possible that someone at the corporate HQ filed it away for future consideration. That feels unlikely, though, given the nine-year gap between the interview and Starbucks beginning its own quest to start selling pumpkin spice lattes in 2003.</p>
<p>But that doesn’t let Starbucks off the hook for copying the ideas of others. Again, the record here is at least mildly damning. The chain lifted its basic concept in 1975 and acquired the Frappuccino by takeover in 1995. The year before launching its own pumpkin spice latte, Starbucks had first entered the seasonal drink competition with a peppermint mocha, which was an immediate hit and, not incidentally, had been sold in other stores around the country for years (here’s <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/1237287901/?match=1&amp;terms=%22peppermint%20mocha%22">Sacramento in 1992</a>, <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/124119163/?match=1&amp;terms=%22peppermint%20mocha%22">Phoenix in 1997</a>, <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/1121809071/?match=1&amp;terms=%22peppermint%20mocha%22">Grand Rapids, Michigan in 1998</a> and, just for kicks, <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/346123466/?match=1&amp;terms=%22peppermint%20mocha%22">a syndicated column mentioning the beverage way back in 1988</a>).</p>
<p>Even if we set aside the Amos interview as an outlier removed from the broader discussion of coffee trends, there’s direct evidence that other baristas and companies beat Starbucks to the pumpkin spice latte.</p>

<p>Other coffee shops had them on their own menus in 2003, apparently before Starbucks, in <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/article/journal-and-courier/183072744/">Lafayette, Indiana</a> and <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-daily-news-journal/116651516/">Murfreesboro, Tennessee</a>, and <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/article/santa-barbara-news-press-torani-pumpkin/183386380/">Torani introduced pumpkin spice syrup in October 2003</a>, billing it as a potential addition to lattes.</p>
<p>I don’t expect anyone at Starbucks to notice or care; it’s just a damn beverage and the origin story doesn’t <em>really </em>matter. But all of this is most interesting, I think, as a window into who gets to claim the label of “innovator” and the mantle of “cool.”</p>
<p>The pumpkin spice latte is integral to Starbucks’ identity at this point, and <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/rise-starbucks-pumpkin-spice-latte-numbers-rcna227205">a major driver of sales and foot traffic (the day it launched this year, foot traffic at the stores went up nearly 25% across the USA)</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://qz.com/the-pumpkin-spice-economy-starbucks-fall">QZ recently called it “the holiday Starbucks invented”</a> and observed,</p>
<blockquote> <p>Starbucks doesn’t just drop a drink; it orchestrates a season (and a quarter). <a href="https://www.starbucks.com/menu/featured">Menus</a>, merch, influencer rituals, and a captive fan base converge into a predictable early-fall traffic event that advertisers would pay to borrow and investors can practically pencil into models. The product is nostalgia. The asset is anticipation. When your customer has been trained to treat a date on the calendar like a holiday, the line between marketing and operations disappears.</p> </blockquote>
<p>Even with all the other products out there with the same flavor profile, it still <em>feels </em>like something that one specific company owns, the triumph trademark PSL cultural hegemony.</p>
<p>But they didn’t start pumpkin spice or even popularize it in the first place, and it’s fascinating to trace the societal resonance of both the flavor and the specific beverage over time. Pumpkin spice was on-trend in the 1960s, and then made its way into gourmet coffee as a sort of hokey, watered-down-for-the-masses version of the Italian brews favored in Seattle. It was caffeine for people <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-oregonian-tuscan-mugs/183412323/">with “Tuscan”-motif coffee mugs</a> in the ’90s or “Live Laugh Love” signs now, which is to say it was popular but decidedly not hip.</p>
<p>Starbucks shifted it again, making it something like akin to cool, or at least well-loved and not overtly cringeworthy; eventually, as all trends must, it became so popular that the novelty and cachet started to burn out. For a while in the early 2010s, the pumpkin spice latte sold well enough but seemed to revert to its pre-Starbucks place in the cultural conversation: <em>kinda basic and definitely not authentic, ugh. </em></p>
<p>The fact that the drink had lost its edge became abundantly clear <a href="https://www.delish.com/kitchen-tools/a65902466/starbucks-psl-real-pumpkin-ingredients/">in 2015, when enough customers complained about the lack of pumpkin in pumpkin spice lattes that Starbucks added puree to the mix</a>. (This may be one of the few times in history that a modern-day trend makes <em>more </em>sense to people from a century earlier. Back then everyone understood that “pumpkin spice” was its own thing, a sprinkle of which “gives zest to the entire compound!”)</p>
<p>I’m no expert, but after a quick scan around the societal landscape, I’d say that we’ve finally reached an equilibrium: pumpkin spice lattes are neither cool nor uncool, but just part of the fabric of our lives every autumn, as pumpkin spice itself was for generations.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/x3afe0/hating_on_pumpkin_spice_is_even_more_basic_than/">“Hating on pumpkin spice is even more basic than enjoying pumpkin spice”</a> reads one Reddit topic, and you can find the same view in recent essays published in <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/in-defense-of-pumpkin-spice/?"><em>Vice </em>and elsewhere.</a></p>
<p>That’s a reasonable, correct perspective. A spice mix shouldn’t be a big-deal signifier. Let it be just another autumnal thing to take or leave as you see fit. But it’s worth remembering, when this season rolls around, that there’s a long, fascinating, and varied history here, completely separate from Starbucks, even if that story has been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSYr0etDzRM">silent all these years</a>.</p>
