<h3>from the <i>booted</i> dept</h3>
<p>Way back in Trump’s first term, back when he was still claiming he was going to build some enormous border wall and get Mexico to pay for it (neither happened), the lovely people over at Cards Against Humanity bought a parcel of land along the boarder with the intention of taking every possible action to prevent a wall being built upon it. It was <a href="https://cardsagainsthumanitystopsthewall.com/">part of a marketing campaign</a> where a percentage of sales of the game would go to buying the land, which eventually happened in 2017. And that’s where things stood for the rest of Trump’s term and all the way up to 2024. No wall was built on the land, Mexico paid for nothing, and the land remained empty.</p>
<p>Until, that is, SpaceX decided to <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2024/09/24/cards-against-humanity-sues-spacex-over-anti-border-wall-land-parcel/">dump</a> a bunch of trash on it. The Elon Musk-owned company has a fabrication plant nearby and apparently just decided to use someone else’s property to dump a bunch of construction materials and trash. The irony that a parcel of land that was bought to keep a border wall from being built to keep out foreign trespassers that was instead trespassed upon domestically is not lost on me.</p>
<p>Well, CAH sued for $15 million and seemed like it had a very good case. SpaceX must have eventually agreed, as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/10/cards-against-humanity-gets-settlement-from-spacex-plans-pack-of-elon-musk-cards/">they have now settled the case</a> days before the trial was set to begin.</p>
<blockquote> <p><em>A <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/250709-Plaintiff-Hole-Holdings-First-Amended-Petition-with-exhibits.pdf">court document</a> shows that SpaceX admitted it did not ask for or receive permission to use the property. SpaceX admitted that its “contractors cleared the lot and put down gravel,” parked vehicles on the property, and stored construction materials. An <a href="https://apnews.com/article/cards-against-humanity-spacex-lawsuit-settlement-texas-db2ef8b5e60f80ad5e6c6b617fa120fe">Associated Press article</a> yesterday said that “Texas court records show a settlement was reached in the case last month, just weeks before a jury trial was scheduled to begin on Nov. 3.”</em></p> <p><em>The game company said a victory at trial wouldn’t have resulted in a better outcome. “A trial would have cost more than what we were likely to win from SpaceX,” the company’s statement to Ars said. “Under Texas law, even if we had won at trial (and we would have, given their admission to trespassing), we likely wouldn’t have been able to recoup our legal fees. And SpaceX certainly seemed ready to dramatically outspend us on lawyers.”</em></p> </blockquote>
<p>Given that the details of the settlement are annoyingly confidential, we can’t really suss out just how just this outcome is. But the folks over at CAH seem to be satisfied, so I have to imagine at least a decent amount of money changed hands here. Still, part of the idea here was supposed to be sending money won from Musk to all the donors to the campaign, but it appears the settlement money won’t be enough to do so in an update CAH provided publicly.</p>
<blockquote> <p><em>Dear Horrible Friends,</em></p> <p><em>Remember last year, when <a href="https://www.elonowesyou100dollars.com/"><strong>we sued Elon Musk</strong></a> for dumping space garbage all over your land, and then you signed up to collect your share of the proceeds? Also, remember how we warned you that we’d “probably only be able to get you like two dollars or most likely nothing”?</em></p> <p><em>Well, Elon Musk’s team admitted on the record that they illegally trespassed on your land, and then they packed up the space garbage and fucked off. But when it comes to paying you all, he did the legal equivalent of throwing dust in our eyes and kicking us in the balls. </em></p> <p><em>So while we can’t give you what you really wanted––cash money from Elon Musk––we’re going to make it up to you, our best, sexiest customers…with comedy! We’re sending you each a brand new mini-pack of exclusive cards all about Elon Musk, which you can <a href="https://freepack.elonowesyou100dollars.com/"><u><strong>sign up to receive for free right here.</strong></u></a></em></p> </blockquote>
<p>You’ve got to give it to these folks: they’re never not on brand.</p>
