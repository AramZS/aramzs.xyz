<p>The big players in the gaming industry have <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/japanese-developers-over-half-generative-ai/">made no secret that they're flirting with AI</a>. Whether it's using AI in game development or <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/tomb-raider-4-6-remastered-ai-voice-generation-france-francoise-cadol-cease-and-desist/">replacing artists and actors</a>, we can expect to see this cropping up in more of our games in the future. However, it might not be the lower budget alternative that the industry was hoping for.</p>
<p>According to a report from <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/inside-ai-divide-roiling-video-game-giant-electronic-arts-2025-10">Business Insider</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.tweaktown.com/news/108403/report-eas-internal-ai-is-causing-issues-with-games-development/index.html">Tweak Town</a>), EA's rollout of AI in game development through its own AI chatbot has not gone as intended. It's claimed that the generative AI tool is prone to "hallucinations", requiring actual human developers to go in and fix its mistakes, costing time and money.</p>
<h2> AI Might Not Be Saving EA Money After All </h2>

<p>These problems reportedly stem from EA's generative AI tool, ReefGPT. It's said that the AI keeps adding incorrect code to projects, which have to be fixed by the developers who don't want to work with the tool in the first place.</p>
<p>It's further claimed that EA's developers fear that they are effectively training their replacement as they help the AI tool do their jobs.</p>
<p>EA was <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/ea-epic-ai-creation-tool-imagination-to-creation/">keen to show its AI tools off last year</a>, showing a scenario in which users could "create" a game through AI prompts. However, this report suggests that ReefGPT hasn't been anywhere near as seamless as the demo the public was shown. With that said, the results looked dull and derivative in the showcase, so it's unclear what the aim is here - other than putting developers out of work.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we will likely see EA expand this technology even further now. The company is <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/ea-acquired-consortium-55-billion-deal/">being acquired by a consortium of investors to the tune of $55 billion</a>. Because of this, we should expect cost-cutting measures to ramp up, like layoffs and studio closures. Investors are likely to want generative AI to be part of that plan, as <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/elon-musk-ai-video-game-footage-launch-2026/">corporate types have been at the forefront of pioneering the technology</a>. At the very least, <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/ea-aquisition-games-devs-union-cwa-asks-for-more-scrutiny-fear-mass-layoffs/">the buyout is facing some scrutiny from a union</a>, so it remains to be seen how this impacts the company and its employees.</p>
