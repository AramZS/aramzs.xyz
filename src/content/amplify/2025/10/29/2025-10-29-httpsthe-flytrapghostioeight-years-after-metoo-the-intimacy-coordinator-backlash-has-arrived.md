<p><a href="https://the-flytrap.ghost.io/eight-years-after-metoo-the-intimacy-coordinator-backlash-has-arrived/#/portal/account/plans"> UPGRADE TODAY! </a></p>
<p>In 2019, one week after actor and director <a href="https://www.instagram.com/faehartt/?hl=en&amp;ref=the-flytrap.ghost.io"><u>Fae Hartt</u></a> turned 18, they were told they needed to be topless onscreen just an hour before filming began. "There was no intimacy coordinator and it was really uncomfortable," Hartt tells the Flytrap, saying that a member of the crew started sending them messages that were “so uncomfortable. It was one of my first on-camera experiences as an adult—barely an adult." When Hartt directed their first short film five years later, hiring an intimacy coordinator was an obvious choice. "I really, really want to make sure that actors, especially young adult actors, are feeling taken care of and safe on film sets."</p>
<p>The role of intimacy coordinator on film and TV sets is still a relatively new one. Although the job has a longer history in theater, it was <a href="https://www.thestage.co.uk/news/call-for-new-intimacy-director-role-to-safeguard-actors-in-sex-scenes?ref=the-flytrap.ghost.io"><u>introduced to the TV and film world in 2017</u></a> in part as a response to the widespread sexual abuse accusations revealed by the #MeToo movement. On a film or TV set, intimacy coordinators work with actors to coordinate scenes that involve sex and nudity in the same way they might a fight scene or dance scene; the professional organization <a href="https://www.idcprofessionals.com/blog/what-is-an-intimacy-director-or-coordinator?ref=the-flytrap.ghost.io"><u>Intimacy Directors and Coordinators (IDC)</u></a> describes the role as a combination of choreographer, advocate, and liaison. The role spread rapidly, from HBO sets to Netflix to Amazon Prime productions, while what, exactly, it involved was still being developed. Eight years into its existence, the intimacy coordinator role is still evolving. Still, despite recent backlash, it remains a vital part of the film industry.</p>
<p>For the first few years, industry responses—at least the public ones—were largely positive. "The intimacy coordinator is transformative," actor <a href="https://theplaylist.net/emily-meade-deuce-interview-20181005/2/?ref=the-flytrap.ghost.io"><u>Emily Meade</u></a> said in 2018. Meade’s request for an intimacy coordinator on <em>The Deuce</em> led to HBO making it standard for all productions. "Intimacy coordinators have revolutionized people’s security and safety in the way that you tell these stories, and rightly so," <em>Bridgerton</em> star <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2020/12/23/bridgerton-netflix-cast-empowering-sex-scenes-13740922/?ref=the-flytrap.ghost.io"><u>Jonathan Bailey</u></a> said in 2020.</p>
<p>In 2021, <em>I May Destroy You</em> creator/writer/director/star Michaela Coel even <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2021/06/michaela-coel-dedicates-bafta-award-to-intimacy-coordinator.html?ref=the-flytrap.ghost.io"><u>dedicated her BAFTA to the show's intimacy coordinator</u></a>, Ita O’Brien. “Thank you for your existence in our industry, for making the space safe for creating physical, emotional, and professional boundaries so that we can make work about exploitation, loss of respect, about abuse of power, without being exploited or abused in the process," Coel said in her acceptance speech.</p>
<p>But by 2022, some actors and directors had no qualms about publicly criticizing the role. That year, <a href="https://variety.com/2022/tv/news/sean-bean-intimacy-coordinators-1235335687/?ref=the-flytrap.ghost.io"><u>Sean Bean</u></a> complained that intimacy coordinators "spoil the spontaneity" and <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/features/general/toni-collette-intimacy-coordinator-the-staircase-1234779177/?ref=the-flytrap.ghost.io"><u>Toni Collette</u></a> revealed that she doesn't work with them because it feels like "encroaching upon the process." In 2023, director <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/16/mia-hansen-love-one-fine-morning-the-most-cathartic-thing-was-turning-a-difficult-dark-reality-into-something-fun?ref=the-flytrap.ghost.io"><u>Mia Hansen-Løve</u></a> called intimacy directors "the virtue police" and in 2024, <a href="https://variety.com/2024/film/news/pamela-anderson-mikey-madison-anora-intimacy-coordinators-1236241323/?ref=the-flytrap.ghost.io"><u>Mikey Madison</u></a> caused a wave of discourse when she said she chose not to work with an intimacy coordinator on <em>Anora</em> (2024) because "I decided it would be best to just keep it small." Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/gwyneth-paltrow-2025-interview?ref=the-flytrap.ghost.io"><u>Gwyneth Paltrow</u></a> caused another flurry of reactions when she said that she prefers not to work with intimacy coordinators because they make her feel "very stifled."</p>
<p>While there are actors and directors who are still speaking positively about intimacy coordinators (<a href="https://www.thewrap.com/richard-gere-jodie-turner-smith-michael-fassbender-intimacy-coordinators/?ref=the-flytrap.ghost.io"><u>Jodie Turner-Smith</u></a>, <a href="https://people.com/michelle-williams-praises-use-of-intimacy-coordinator-dying-for-sex-exclusive-11708222?ref=the-flytrap.ghost.io"><u>Michelle Williams</u></a>, <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/articles/annie-wilkes-did-nothing-wrong-153000511.html?ref=the-flytrap.ghost.io"><u>Molly Gordon</u></a>, and <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/dakota-johnson-intimacy-coordiantor-first-time-1236432637/?ref=the-flytrap.ghost.io"><u>Dakota Johnson</u></a> have all praised them this year), the overall tone has changed—perhaps as part of a <a href="https://www.damemagazine.com/2025/06/03/was-the-metoo-backlash-inevitable/?ref=the-flytrap.ghost.io"><u>larger backlash against the #MeToo movement</u></a>. But while the development of the role hasn't been perfect, there are many in the industry who still see the intimacy coordinator as a vital part in ensuring on-set safety.</p>
<p>When talking about criticism of intimacy coordinators, not all complaints are equal. While many of those viral celebrity interviews mention lack of creativity, censorship, or "the virtue police," others raise valid concerns that point to how productions should change their working relationships with intimacy coordinators.</p>
<p>Hiring an intimacy coordinator often adds to the expense of making a film or TV series, not only due to the intimacy coordinator's fee but also because they enforce the <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/educate-yourself%C2%A0your-rights-regarding-scenes-involving-nudity-or-simulated-sex%C2%A0?ref=the-flytrap.ghost.io"><u>SAG-AFTRA-mandated 48-hour wait time</u></a> between informing an actor that nudity will be needed and filming the scene. "One of the first things I learned in my [intimacy coordinator] classes was to recognize and resist urgency. Sadly, in this culture, we're focused on: how quickly can we get from point A to point B? How quickly can we get something delivered to our house? How quickly can we hit this dopamine? How quickly can we shoot this sex scene?" says intimacy coordinator <a href="https://www.instagram.com/intimacywithshelby/?ref=the-flytrap.ghost.io"><u>Shelby Terrell</u></a>, who worked on the 2025 movie <em>Oh, Hi!.</em> "That is when mistakes can be made and people can get hurt."</p>
<p>Productions might hire an intimacy coordinator for a very limited time as a way to save money, meaning that an intimacy coordinator does not have long enough to truly connect and collaborate with actors and directors. "A lot of times it's like, 'Okay, well, if we've got a little bit of budget, we'll have them here for this one day,'" says intimacy coordinator <a href="https://www.instagram.com/amandakrue/?hl=en&amp;ref=the-flytrap.ghost.io"><u>Amanda K. Rue</u></a>. "And that is not sufficient because if you're just there for the one day, and there's been none of the pre-work."</p>
<p>Preferably, an intimacy coordinator would have discussions with the actors and director before filming begins, covering topics such as blocking and choreography, costumes or modesty garments, boundaries, the angles the camera will capture, and the general mood of the scene.</p>
<p>Some critics of intimacy coordinators see the role as HR-adjacent—a tool for productions to defend themselves legally in case of future complaints of sexual harassment and assault. Indeed, this function of the job dates back to when it was first popularized. The role became widespread in the American film and TV industry after five women accused James Franco of sexual harassment and assault in 2018. Franco was the star of <em>The Deuce</em>, and after outcry from both the public and some cast members, HBO hired an intimacy coordinator for the show. Then, HBO <a href="https://slate.com/culture/2018/10/hbo-sex-scenes-the-deuce-watchman-intimacy-coordinators.html?ref=the-flytrap.ghost.io"><u>made the intimacy coordinator role mandatory across all shows</u></a> that have intimacy scenes, and other companies followed HBO's example. Franco <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/the_deuce/s03?ref=the-flytrap.ghost.io"><u>remained both the star and an executive producer of <em>The Deuce</em></u></a> for the remainder of its time on air.</p>
<p>Similarly, other industry professionals have championed intimacy coordinators while laundering their image after accusations of abuse—for example, earlier this year, Michael Fassbender <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/richard-gere-jodie-turner-smith-michael-fassbender-intimacy-coordinators/?ref=the-flytrap.ghost.io"><u>effusively praised</u></a> intimacy coordinator Ita O'Brien, and O'Brien responded by publicly thanking him <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DMPJLk3o-Iz/?img_index=3&amp;ref=the-flytrap.ghost.io"><u>on Instagram</u></a>. In 2010, Fassbender's ex-girlfriend <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/features/general/michael-fassbender-abuse-allegations-sunawin-leasi-andrews-1201927946/?ref=the-flytrap.ghost.io"><u>filed a restraining order against him</u></a> citing physical and sexual abuse, including dragging her from a moving car.</p>
<p>The intimacy coordinator career remains a relatively new one, which means it's still changing and growing. "This role developed before it was ready for the level of mainstream media," says intimacy coordinator <a href="https://www.laurenkdeleon.com/?ref=the-flytrap.ghost.io"><u>Lauren Kiele DeLeon</u></a>. "I think that is a big part of the conversation that's missed: It became so mainstream, so fast while still trying to figure out what it needed to be. People really, really jumped on it, especially with the #MeToo movement. I think a lot of the popularity came from production companies wanting to save their asses, wanting to make sure they didn't end up in a similar situation." She compares the development of the role to "building the car while driving the car."</p>
<p>Today, there are many paths to intimacy coordinator certification—SAG-AFTRA recognizes <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/contracts-industry-resources/report-discrimination/intimacy-coordinator-resources/training-program?ref=the-flytrap.ghost.io"><u>12 separate training programs</u></a>—and training isn't standardized. Some programs <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ps_jpZ8ZlvIWU7i0QxJKpmF9ylseBUDlYqXCLTty1xU/edit?tab=t.0&amp;ref=the-flytrap.ghost.io"><u>rely heavily</u></a> on pre-recorded video lectures, while others involve <a href="https://www.intimacyprofessionalsassociation.com/ictraining?ref=the-flytrap.ghost.io"><u>live instruction over Zoom </u></a>and require participation in in-person, hands-on workshops for certification.</p>
<p>"I think one of the things that would be really useful and important to the industry is to be able to create a general universal agreement: What is this work? What do we do? How do we set standards for training and standards for professionals within this field, so that we do have a general baseline for what an intimacy coordinator does?" says DeLeon. "I think part of the messiness of it comes from the fact that there are so many different types of training that do different things, and there's no real regulation over what training you need to have had to be able to do this work professionally."</p>
<p>This lack of standardization means that, particularly in the early years of intimacy coordination, some intimacy coordinators are inexperienced or just plain bad at their jobs. A search through Reddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/acting/comments/ql4lla/i_had_a_bad_intimacy_coordinator/?ref=the-flytrap.ghost.io"><u>finds stories</u></a> of intimacy coordinators who didn't help actors get closed sets, bring actors a bathrobe, or even communicate with them at all. "People are eager to get into this work, so some people are jumping in who aren't necessarily qualified to do the work, which can mean people have bad experiences with them," says intimacy coordinator <a href="https://www.elaine-bell.com/?ref=the-flytrap.ghost.io"><u>Elaine Bell</u></a>. But some people are bad at their job in every single career path—intimacy coordinators are no exception. "Obviously, there are going to be people who don't know what they're doing in any field, but I don't think it's limited to intimacy coordinators," says Hartt. "You need to find collaborators that you work well with."</p>
<p>Many of the public complaints about intimacy coordinators come from actors—like <a href="https://www.the-independent.com/arts-entertainment/tv/news/jennifer-aniston-morning-show-intimacy-coordinators-b2463775.html?ref=the-flytrap.ghost.io"><u>Jennifer Aniston</u></a> and <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/05/07/we-used-to-manage-sex-scenes-ourselves-michael-douglas-says/?ref=the-flytrap.ghost.io"><u>Michael Douglas</u></a>—who haven't actually worked with any before. DeLeon suggests, "Pushback can sometimes come because if somebody admits that this work is important and that they wished it had been around beforehand, it might also mean admitting that harm has either been done to them in the past or they may have caused harm in the past."</p>
<p>Actors like Gwyneth Paltrow who have complained about intimacy coordinators being "stifling" or micromanaging might also sometimes have a valid point—depending on the situation. Intimacy coordinator <a href="https://letstalkaboutsexbaby.com/?ref=the-flytrap.ghost.io"><u>j</u></a><a href="https://letstalkaboutsexbaby.com/?ref=the-flytrap.ghost.io"><u>o Valdés</u></a> says, "Actors are within their rights to be like, 'I actually just don't want to talk to you. I don't want this kind of support.' But the idea that we shouldn't be present or available is questionable to me."</p>
<p>Additionally, actors might not understand that intimacy coordinators aren't just there to keep them safe, but to keep everyone on the crew safe as well. The role should be understood as a safeguarding measure for everyone on set, says Bell. "We're not just there for the actors, we're there for the cast and crew as well, who are having to watch these scenes or film these scenes for long periods of time. We never know what people are coming into the room with, what lives they're coming from, what may trigger something for them, or what they are uncomfortable with." Like stunt coordinators, intimacy coordinators should not be optional, Bell adds. "The onus should not be on actors to say yes or no for an intimacy coordinator. That's what we're fighting for with SAG-AFTRA. We want it to be mandatory. Because actors shouldn't be in the position to say yes or no to safety precautions, you know?"</p>

<p>Despite public complaints from directors like <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/features/general/mia-hansen-love-intimacy-coordinators-virtue-police-1234828896/?ref=the-flytrap.ghost.io"><u>Mia Hansøn-Love</u></a>, other directors say that working with intimacy coordinators enhances their creativity, rather than hinders it. "I think if you don't know how to express your vision to an intimacy coordinator, you might just not be that good of a director," says Hartt. "It was very, very easy to say, 'I'm looking for this type of vibe, this type of attitude,' and to work with my coordinator." Hartt hired Bell for their short film <a href="https://www.instagram.com/left.shortfilm/?ref=the-flytrap.ghost.io"><em><u>all that’s left</u></em></a>. "She was not only very comforting and kind to everyone, but she was also just really good at her job. She made some very, very stunning choices that ended up looking great in the film. So I'm very grateful for her," Hartt says.</p>
<p>Most of all, for actors—particularly those who are just starting their careers or filming sex scenes for the first time—intimacy coordinators can make a world of difference. Actor <a href="https://www.emmaldewitt.com/?ref=the-flytrap.ghost.io"><u>Emma DeWitt</u></a> says that before filming their first sex scene, they were excited but also nervous. “I had never had to perform that level of intimacy," they said. But with the help of their intimacy coordinator—also Bell—"immediately all of my nerves were put at ease. She made me and my scene partner feel super comfortable and it became a similar feeling to any other kind of blocking—like, okay, we're doing a handshake now, or a punch," DeWitt says.</p>
<p>"It took the pressure off in a really wonderful way and made it feel very safe."</p>
