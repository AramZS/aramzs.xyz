  Though Benioff's shift mirrors Silicon Valley's broader accommodation of
  Trump, the exchange offered a rare glimpse of just how far that repositioning

  and call for federal troops in their own backyard?

  Salesforce CEO says National Guard should patrol San Francisco -- stunning his
  own PR team | TechCrunch
---
<p>Marc Benioff has long been San Francisco’s liberal-leaning billionaire, the tech executive who funded homeless services, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/07/us/california-today-tech-billionaire-adopt-a-school.html">donated</a> to the city’s public schools, and hosted Hillary Clinton fundraisers.</p>
<p>But in a new, wide-ranging <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/us/marc-benioff-san-francisco-guard.html">phone interview</a> with the New York Times from his private plane, Benioff revealed a political transformation that seemed to surprise even his own communications team, despite that Salesforce has hundreds of contracts with the federal government.</p>
<p>The Salesforce founder declared he “fully supported” President Trump and thought National Guard troops should patrol San Francisco streets. He gushed about sitting across from Trump at a Windsor Castle state dinner, telling the president “how grateful I am for everything he’s doing.” He praised Elon Musk’s government efficiency efforts and said he hadn’t closely followed news about immigration raids or Trump’s attacks on the media.</p>
<p>The 50-minute conversation reportedly ended after Benioff turned to his public relations executive, apparently noticing her expression. “What about the political questions?” he could be heard asking. “Too spicy?”</p>
<p>Though Benioff’s shift mirrors Silicon Valley’s broader accommodation of Trump, the exchange offered a rare glimpse of just how far that repositioning can go. The question now: will other Bay Area tech CEOs follow Benioff’s lead and call for federal troops in their own backyard?</p>
