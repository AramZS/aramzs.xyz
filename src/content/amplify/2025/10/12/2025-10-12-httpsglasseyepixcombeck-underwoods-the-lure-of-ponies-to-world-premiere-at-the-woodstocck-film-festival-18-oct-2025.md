<strong><em><a href="https://woodstockfilmfestival.org/2025-film-guide?filmId=68964d736e6f87c2d14246da">THE LURE OF PONIES; A Spellbound Attic Mystery</a></em></strong><br/>
at the Woodstock Film Festival this 18 &amp;19 October 2025<br/>
with Q&amp;A</p>
<p><strong>ABOUT THE FILM:</strong></p>
<p>This stop motion animation mystery is set in the attic of a long shuttered vintage emporium populated by a chosen family of cast aside dolls. The attic hums with fun and camaraderie, but also secrets and danger. Detective-in-residence Frances Faraday, a Victorian-era porcelain doll, and her sidekick Midge, a sixties-era plastic doll, are called into action when a bereaved baby doll arrives with a missing person case: her 8-year-old human playmate Lily hasn’t been seen in over one hour! Is Lily just playing hide and seek? Or is something more sinister afoot? Solving this case will take these private eye dolls on a wild ride through the spellbound attic.</p>
<p>A playful homage to the cozy mystery genre, <em>The Lure of Ponies</em> poignantly explores themes of abandonment, longing, and desire. Director Beck Underwood embraces the intangible spirit life of the inanimate with energy and humor. – Noelle Melody</p>
