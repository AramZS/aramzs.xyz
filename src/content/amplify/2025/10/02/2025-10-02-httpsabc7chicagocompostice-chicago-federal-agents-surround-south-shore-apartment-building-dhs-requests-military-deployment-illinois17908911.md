<p>CHICAGO (WLS) -- Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents raided a South Shore apartment building overnight.</p>
<p>Residents and neighbors are speaking out at what they call a traumatic event.</p>
<p>ABC7 spoke to a woman who lives there. She says ICE agents took everyone in the building, including her, and asked questions later.</p>
<p>"They just treated us like we were nothing," said Pertissue Fisher.</p>

<p>Fisher says she came out to the hallway of her apartment complex on the corner of 75th and South Shore Drive in her nightgown around 10 p.m. Monday only to find armed ICE agents yelling "police."</p>
<p>"It was scary, because I had never had a gun in my face," Fisher. "They asked my name and my date of birth and asked me, did I have any warrants? And I told them, 'No,' I didn't."</p>
<p>She says she was then handcuffed and released around 3 a.m. Fisher says she was told if anyone had any kind of warrant out for them, even if it was unrelated to immigration, they would not be released.</p>

<p>Citizen app video shows the chaotic scene, and neighbors say there were dozens of ICE agents. Neighbors like Eboni Watson say they ducked for cover as they heard several flash bangs.</p>
<p>"They was terrified. The kids was crying. People was screaming. They looked very distraught. I was out there crying when I seen the little girl come around the corner, because they was bringing the kids down too. Had them zip tied to each other," Watson said. "That's all I kept asking. What is the morality? Where's the human? One of them literally laughed. He was standing right here. He said, 'f*** them kids.'"</p>
<p>Watson says budget trucks and military style vans were used to separate parents from their children. Other neighbors say agents destroyed property to get in the building.</p>
<p>"They had a big, 15-inch chainsaw with round blade on it, cutting this fence down," said witness Darrell Ballard. "We're under siege. We're being invaded by our own military."</p>
<p>The FBI confirmed on Tuesday morning that they were helping U.S. Border Patrol carry out a targeted immigration enforcement operation in the area. They say they have been supporting these efforts at the direction of the U.S. attorney general.</p>
<h2>Protesters block streets downtown</h2>

<p>Raids like the one carried out in South Shore have been prompting protests across the Chicago area.</p>
<p>On Tuesday evening, demonstrators against immigration enforcement blocked part of westbound Wacker Drive at Michigan Avenue.</p>
<p>One organizer there told ABC7 that as the Trump administration and the Department of Homeland Security ramp up their efforts, so will the community.</p>
<p>The Coalition Against the Trump Administration organized what they call an "emergency protest against ICE and federal troops in Chicago."</p>

<p>Organizers and protesters told ABC7 this demonstration is in direct response to what played out overnight in the South Shore neighborhood and over the weekend in other areas.</p>
<p>Dozens of armed federal agents could be seen swarming downtown Chicago, at times appearing to detain multiple people on Sunday, in addition to the events that took place at an ICE facility in Broadview, where agents in full tactical gear used a variety of chemical agents.</p>
<p>Protesters say as these federal operations ramp up, they will continue to mobilize in order to protect their community.</p>
<p>Speeches on Wacker were ongoing around 6 p.m. before the group started marching northbound on Michigan Avenue.</p>
<h2>Trump suggests Chicago should be training ground for military</h2>
<figure><img alt="" data-mptype="image" src="https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/17913045_093025-wls-craig-military-to-chi-5p-vid.jpg?w=608"/><figcaption>President Donald Trump is putting Chicago back in the spotlight on Tuesday, saying it is one several Democratic cities that should be used as training grounds for the military.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Meanwhile, President Donald Trump is putting Chicago back in the spotlight on Tuesday, saying it is one of several Democratic cities that should be used as training grounds for the military.</p>
<p>And while federal agents continue their efforts as part of operation "Midway Blitz," Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson raised new concerns in response to the president's suggestion that Chicago could be used as a proving ground for the National Guard.</p>
<p>DHS has been ramping up its immigration enforcement efforts and its show of force in Chicago, with armed Border Patrol agents making their presence known downtown in recent days.</p>
<p>On Monday, Pritzker said he has learned that DHS sent a memo suggesting <a data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://abc7chicago.com/post/ice-chicago-today-illinois-governor-jb-pritzker-speak-monday-border-patrol-federal-agents-detain-people-downtown/17902579/">it is planning to deploy 100 members of the National Guard</a> to help protect ICE agents, who have frequently clashed with protesters.</p>
<p>Now, Trump has raised the stakes for Chicago during a meeting with military leaders and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. The president called Chicago an unsafe place that he plans to straighten out.</p>
<p>"And this is going to be a major part for some of the people in this room. That's a war, too. It's a war from within. I told Pete, we should use some of these dangerous cities as training grounds for our military," Trump said.</p>
<p>The governor and the mayor fired back.</p>
<p>"American cities are not training ground for the military. It's, quite frankly, it's appalling that he would even suggest such a thing," Johnson said.</p>
<p>"Sending troops into cities, thinking that that's some sort of proving ground for war, or that indeed there's some sort of internal war going on in the United States, is, just frankly, inane," Pritzker said.</p>
<p>Some Republicans are calling on the governor to tone down the rhetoric. They also believe the National Guard could help restore order in light of the escalating tensions between ICE agents and protesters.</p>
<p>"I think in order to keep things under control, you have to get things under control," said Assistant Minority Leader and Republican Illinois state Rep. C. D. Davidsmeyer.</p>
<p>"I believe that the governor and the mayor are afraid, what if? What if it works? What if additional support actually lowers crime and keeps people safe?" said House Minority Leader and Republican Illinois state Rep. Tony McCombie.</p>
<p>Pritzker pointed to the conflicts at the ICE processing station on Broadview, saying the state is offering assistance.</p>
<p>"They deserve peace. That is why ICE needs to back off, and that is why the president of the United States should not send troops to the state of Illinois," Pritzker said.</p>
<p>The governor said he has no new information about a National Guard or troop deployment to the Chicago area, but the state remains poised and ready to file lawsuits if and when it happens.</p>
