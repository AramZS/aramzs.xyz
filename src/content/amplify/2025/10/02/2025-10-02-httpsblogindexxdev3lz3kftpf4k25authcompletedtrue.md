title: PDSes Open for Asylum
---
<p>Some of the following PDSes require an invite code to sign up, but are still open to everyone. The invite codes are enabled to prevent bots and abuse of the service.</p>
<p>If you know of (or run) any PDS that is offering invites out, feel free to reply to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/indexx.dev/post/3lz3kg3s4g225">this post</a> and I'll add them here!</p>
<blockquote data-index="2">Please note that each of these PDSes has their own rules and guidelines that they may enforce. As far as I know, most of these are pretty lenient, but they do still reserve the right to kick you off at their own digression. </blockquote>
<p>Some of these PDSes have a custom sign-up page, in that case you can find it linked below the main link. If you use a service such as <a href="https://pdsmoover.com">pdsmoover.com</a> to migrate PDSes, the main URL above all the other indented text is the URL of the PDS that you should enter.</p>
<h3 data-index="5">Open to everyone:</h3>
<ul><li><p data-index="6.5"><a href="https://pds.tgirl.cloud/">https://pds.tgirl.cloud/</a></p><ul><li><p data-index="6.5.4">This should go without saying, but homophobia and transphobia are strictly forbidden on this PDS (and you shouldn't spread anything even remotely close to either of those 2 things anywhere to begin with!)</p> </li></ul> </li></ul>
<h3 data-index="8">Safe spaces:</h3>
<ul><li><p data-index="9.0"><a href="https://blacksky.app">https://blacksky.app</a> (org: <a href="https://blackskyweb.xyz">https://blackskyweb.xyz</a> )</p><ul><li><p data-index="9.0.5">Handle endings available: .myatproto.social, .blacksky.app, .cryptoanarchy.network</p> </li></ul> </li></ul>
<p>Wafrn Instances:</p>
<p>Wafrn is a Tumblr-like social media site that allows you to interact with people on both the Fediverse (e.g. Mastodon, Pixelfed, Loops, etc) &amp; Bluesky. The Bluesky integration is experimental, and should be used cautiously at the moment, and the official instance has some downtime issues.</p>
<blockquote data-index="13">More Wafrn instances exist than listed here, I've only added these 2 by request &amp; since I know they have the experimental Bluesky integration enabled.</blockquote>
