<p>One way you can opt out of the sale or sharing of your personal information is by using an “opt-out preference signal,” or “OOPS” for short. An OOPS automatically tells websites not to sell or share your personal information. You don’t have to submit a request on each website—OOPS does it for you.</p>
<p>An example of an OOPS is a setting in your internet browser or a browser extension like the <a href="https://globalprivacycontrol.org/">Global Privacy Controlopens in a new window</a>. It sends an automatic message to businesses, letting them know you’ve chosen to opt out of the sale or sharing of your information on their website. It’s a simple way to get started protecting your privacy.</p>
<ul> <li> <ol> <li> <h3>Choose a browser or extension that supports OOPS</h3> <p>Use a browser that has OOPS built in or choose a trusted browser extension. Some forms of OOPS, like the Global Privacy Control, offer suggested browsers or extensions that you can choose from. </p> </li> <li> <h3>Open your privacy settings</h3> <p>In your browser, go to <strong>Settings</strong> and find the <strong>Privacy</strong> or <strong>Security</strong> section. Or, if using an extension, open the extension’s settings.</p> </li> <li> <h3>Turn on OOPS</h3> <p>Locate the OOPS setting in your browser or extension and turn it on. Once enabled, it will automatically tell websites that you do not want your personal data sold or shared.</p> </li> </ol> </li> </ul>
<p>Some browsers do not currently support OOPS on mobile devices. That’s why CalPrivacy supports the creation of a new law to make sure all browsers support OOPS. In the meantime, we suggest checking with trusted reviewers who can suggest browsers that are more privacy protective, including those who support OOPS on mobile platforms.</p>
