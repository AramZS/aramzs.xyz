<p>Tommy Robinson has claimed Elon Musk was paying his legal costs as he went on trial for refusing to comply with a request made by counterterrorism police as he tried to leave Britain last year.</p>
<p>Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, was stopped by police officers at the border in a silver Bentley with thousands of pounds in cash, Westminster magistrates’ court was told.</p>
<p>The 42-year-old was driving to the Spanish tourist hotspot of Benidorm when he was stopped by officers at the Channel Tunnel in Folkestone <a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/border-security-loophole-meant-tommy-robinson-could-leave-uk-xt9ggx68g">on July 28 last year</a>. He is accused of refusing to provide the PIN to his mobile phone during the stop. He has been charged with failing to comply with police powers under the Terrorism Act.</p>
<p>Under Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000, officers have powers to stop and question individuals at UK ports and borders to assess potential involvement in terrorism. Detainees are legally required to comply, including providing access to electronic devices.</p>
<p>Before the hearing, Robinson claimed in a video posted on X that the billionaire Musk had “picked up the legal bill” for “this absolute state persecution”.</p>
<p>Jo Morris, for the prosecution, told the court that officers became suspicious due to his “vague replies” and “unusual behaviour”, noting that he had not booked a ticket in advance and was driving a high-value vehicle not registered in his name.</p>
<p>Upon being led to an interview room, Robinson allegedly attempted to film himself saying he had been arrested. He was told to stop recording and “relax”, the court heard. When asked to provide his phone’s PIN, he responded: “Not a chance bruv … you look like c*** so you ain’t having it.”</p>
<p>He told officers the device contained sensitive information about “vulnerable girls”, adding: “It’s my work, I’m a journalist.” The court was told that the legal process for protecting journalistic material was explained to him at the time.</p>
<p>Robinson was found carrying over £13,000 in cash and €1,900. PC Mitchell Thorogood of the Channel Tunnel policing team described the decision to buy his ticket on the day of travel as “unusual”, and said Robinson’s demeanour raised concerns.</p>
<p>During his interview, Robinson allegedly told officers: “For me, it’s a win-win. It’s going to be bad for yous.”</p>
<p>Alisdair Williamson KC, for the defence, suggested that Robinson’s political views may have influenced the decision to stop him, raising concerns of a “discriminatory” use of powers.</p>
<p>Robinson denies the charge. If convicted, he faces up to three months in prison or a £2,500 fine. Wearing a waistcoat and tie, he appeared animated during breaks in the hearing, pacing the courtroom and checking his phone.</p>
<p>The trial continues.</p>
