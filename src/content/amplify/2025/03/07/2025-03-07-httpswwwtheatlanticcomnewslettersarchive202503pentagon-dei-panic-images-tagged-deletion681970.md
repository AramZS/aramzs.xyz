  The Pentagon is reviewing its archives to remove materials related to
  diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). This includes deleting images that
  highlight contributions from minorities, like a photo of the Enola Gay. Many
  are concerned about this move and what it means for military history and
  representation.

title: The Pentagon’s DEI Panic

Lately, I’ve been thinking of a classic ’80s anti-war song by <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5XJ2GiR6Bo">Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark</a>, a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://garryberman.medium.com/when-british-new-wave-was-new-and-great-d6d1b6e32a40">British new-wave</a> band, whose lyrics were an angry ode to the airplane that dropped the first nuclear weapon on Japan:</p><blockquote><p>Enola Gay</p> <p>It shouldn’t ever have to end this way</p> <p>Enola Gay</p> <p>It shouldn’t fade in our dreams away</p></blockquote><p>The Enola Gay<i> </i>was <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Enola-Gay">named</a> for the mother of its pilot, Colonel Paul Tibbets. It will not fade away: The plane and its mission will always have an important place in military history. But people working in the United States Department of Defense might have a harder time finding a reference to it on any military website, because of an archival sweep of newly forbidden materials at the Pentagon.</p><p>Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has ordered a massive review of DOD computer archives in an attempt to “align” the department with President Donald Trump’s <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/ending-radical-and-wasteful-government-dei-programs-and-preferencing/">directive</a> to eliminate anything on government systems that could be related to DEI. At the Defense Department, this seems to mean scrubbing away any posts or images on military servers that might highlight the contributions of minorities, including gay service members. So far, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://apnews.com/article/dei-purge-images-pentagon-diversity-women-black-8efcfaec909954f4a24bad0d49c78074">according</a> to the Associated Press, some 26,000 images have been flagged for deletion, including a photo of the Enola Gay, because … well, <i>gay</i>.</p><p>Of course, tagging for deletion images such as those of the Enola Gay is likely a mistake made by someone who plugged in <i>gay</i> as a keyword for a global find-and-mark command. The military, like other organizations, loves metrics, and the people in charge of executing the anti-DEI push almost certainly want to be able to show some sort of measurable progress on “eliminating DEI.”</p><p>But why not just focus on the president’s order to cancel current spending on such programs? As a former DOD employee, I had to sit through some DEI events, and in my view, they were not a great use of government time. I did not need a professor from a local college to come in and explain what <i>cis</i> means. (My first thought during that presentation was: <i>How much are we paying for this?</i>)</p><p>Hegseth and the Pentagon, however, don’t seem particularly focused on pruning <i>all </i>wasteful spending, because they’re actually spending money and investing hours of federal-worker time to indulge in a kind of gay panic in the DOD archives. This effort is part of a larger memory-holing exercise that includes not only getting rid of references to sexual minorities, but also eradicating racial and ethnic “firsts.” As the AP reported: “The vast majority of the Pentagon purge targets women and minorities, including notable milestones made in the military. And it also removes a large number of posts that mention various commemorative months—such as those for Black and Hispanic people and women.”</p><p>It’s humorous to think that the Enola Gay<i> </i>got caught in a roundup of ostensibly pro-LGBTQ materials, but the whole business raises the question of the purpose behind deleting tens of thousands of images. There is something fundamentally weird about interpreting an order to get rid of DEI programs as a charge to erase pages of American history. What are the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/why-us-military-completely-obsessed-1-word-lethality-35527">lethal</a> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://aviationweek.com/easy-warfighter">warfighters</a> of the Pentagon so afraid of?</p><p>The most likely answer is that they’re afraid of Trump, but the larger problem is that the MAGA movement—including its supporters in the military and the Defense Department—is based on fear and insecurity, a sense that American culture is hostile to them and that Trump is the protector of a minority under siege. Many members of this movement believe that the “left,” or whatever remains of it now, is engaged in a war on the traditional family, on masculinity, on American capitalism, on Christmas and Christians. They see DEI as one of the many spiritual and moral pathogens that threaten to infect fine young men and women (especially <i>white</i> ones) and turn them into sexually decadent Marxists.</p><p>They also seem to believe that the way to stop this is to engage in rewriting history so that impressionable young Americans don’t accidentally encounter positive images of Black or female or gay service members. After all, there’s no telling where <i>that </i>leads.</p><p>This trepidation reflects a lack of faith in their own children and their fellow citizens, and it is produced in the same bubble of isolation and suspicion that makes parents fearful of letting children move away, especially to go to college. Anxious parents in small towns might not know better, but an immense—and diverse—military organization of 3 million service members and civilians surely does. In the end, however, it doesn’t matter whether anyone in the DOD agrees or disagrees with this silly crusade: Orders are orders.</p><p>In 1953, when Stalin died, the other members of the Soviet leadership soon closed ranks against the chief of the secret police, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.historytoday.com/archive/months-past/lavrenti-beria-executed">Lavrenti Beria</a>, a vicious monster of a man who kept tabs on all of them. They put him on trial, shot him in a Moscow bunker, and did not speak of him in public again. After his execution, subscribers to the <i>Great Soviet Encyclopedia</i> were sent an article on the Bering Strait, with <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1991-11-09-mn-1063-story.html">instructions</a> to remove the entry on Beria and replace it with the new entry on the Arctic waterway. Many Soviet citizens did as they were told.</p><p>Today, no one needs to engage in such complicated methods. If Hegseth’s commissars want to replace the history of the Tuskegee Airmen with an article about the soil and weather in Tuskegee, Alabama, a functionary at the Pentagon can do it with a keystroke, while zapping away references to gays, to minorities, to women—perhaps with the hope that one day, no one will even remember what’s been lost.</p></body></html>
