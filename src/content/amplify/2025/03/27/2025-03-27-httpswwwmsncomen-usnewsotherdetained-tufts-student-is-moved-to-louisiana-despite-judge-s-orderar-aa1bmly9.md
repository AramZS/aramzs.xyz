title: Detained Tufts Student Is Moved to Louisiana Despite Judge’s Order
---
<p>Federal agents moved a Turkish student arrested in Massachusetts to Louisiana despite a judge’s order barring her transfer without notice.</p><p>Rumeysa Ozturk is being held at an immigration center in Louisiana, attorneys for the administration said Thursday. Judge Indira Talwani’s order that a 48-hour notice must be given before her transfer came too late, the attorneys said.</p><p>Ozturk, a  Ph.D. student on a student visa, was taken into custody Tuesday outside her off-campus apartment building in Somerville, Mass., according to Tufts University and court records. She was on her way to meet friends and break her fast for Ramadan when she was detained, her lawyer, Mahsa Khanbabai, said.</p><p>Ozturk, a Fulbright scholar, wasn’t charged with any crime and wasn’t allowed to speak to her attorney until she was already in Louisiana, according to her legal team.</p><p>Agents in masks and street clothes approached Ozturk on the street and led her away in handcuffs as she screamed, according to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/video/tufts-graduate-student-detained-by-federal-immigration-authorities/08C7F879-70E4-4259-A8DF-319E80D7365E">video of the detention</a>.</p><p>Judge Talwani’s order was issued after her arrest. The administration’s attorneys on Thursday didn’t specify when Ozturk was moved to Louisiana.</p><figure><img data-document-id="cms/api/amp/image/AA1BMt9I" data-reference="image" src="https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AA1BMt9I.img"/><figcaption>Ozturk on an apple-picking trip in 2021.

His lawyers have been arguing to move his case <a href="https://www.wsj.com/us-news/law/new-york-judge-orders-mahmoud-khalils-case-be-moved-to-new-jersey-b45467a0">back to the Northeast</a>.</p><p>The Trump administration has been on a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/us-news/law/trump-administration-asks-supreme-court-for-power-to-resume-deportation-flights-645baa37">campaign to arrest and deport</a> international students who participated in campus protests. Several of the targeted students were involved in pro-Palestinian demonstrations over the past year.</p><p>On Thursday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that the administration had revoked Ozturk’s student visa and at least 300 other visas for participating in pro-Palestinian activities at school.</p><p>“We gave you a visa to come and study and get a degree—not to become a social activist who tears up our university campuses,” Rubio told reporters during a stop in Guyana.</p><p>Ozturk co-wrote an opinion piece published last year in the Tufts Daily, the school’s student newspaper, calling on the university administration to take a pro-Palestinian stance on the Israel-Gaza war. Her name was listed on a website that publishes personal information of college students it claims are anti-Israel or antisemitic.</p><p>“Now she is being unlawfully targeted by the Trump administration simply because she co-authored an op-ed calling for Palestinians to have basic human rights,” Ozturk’s lawyer said.</p><p>Free-speech advocates have said the student arrests are attempts to retaliate against rights protected by the First Amendment.</p><p>“When you single out people for punishment because you don’t like what they’re saying, that is a fundamental violation of free speech,” said Burt Neuborne, professor of civil liberties emeritus at New York University.</p><p>Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Campbell, a Democrat, said the footage of Ozturk’s arrest was disturbing.</p><p>“It is alarming that the federal administration chose to ambush and detain her, apparently targeting a law-abiding individual because of her political views,” she said. “This isn’t public safety, it’s intimidation.”</p><figure><img data-document-id="cms/api/amp/image/AA1BMcLT" data-reference="image" src="https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AA1BMcLT.img"/><figcaption>Demonstrators rallied for Ozturk in Somerville, Mass., on Wednesday. (faith ninivaggi/Reuters)</figcaption></figure><p>Tufts told its community in an email Wednesday that anyone who encounters government officials on campus should call the university police. Tufts said visa holders should consult with the university before traveling out of the country.</p><p>Ozturk’s lawyer said in court filings that Ozturk’s detention violated her Fifth Amendment rights and that she was detained without her asthma medications.</p><p>After Ozturk was arrested, her attorney, filed a petition to keep her detained in Massachusetts, where Ozturk lives and works. Khanbabai also asked the government to tell her where her client was located.</p><p>Federal authorities might be trying to bring its immigration cases in an appellate system where they are more likely to notch a win, said Matthew Boaz, a professor who teaches immigration law at the University of Kentucky.</p><p>The appellate court in Louisiana, the Fifth Circuit, has legal precedent that is less friendly to immigrants. “The Fifth Circuit is more amenable to executive power,” Boaz said.</p><p>Write to Alyssa Lukpat at <a href="mailto:alyssa.lukpat@wsj.com">alyssa.lukpat@wsj.com</a>, Vera Bergengruen at <a href="mailto:vera.bergengruen@wsj.com">vera.bergengruen@wsj.com</a> and Gretchen Tarrant Gulla at <a href="mailto:gretchen.tarrant@wsj.com">gretchen.tarrant@wsj.com</a></p>
