  Amazon will begin sending all voice recordings from Echo devices to its cloud
  on March 28, removing a privacy feature that allowed local processing. Users
  who want to keep their recordings private will lose access to the Voice ID
  feature, which enhances Alexa’s capabilities. This change reflects Amazon's
  push for its new subscription service, Alexa+, while raising concerns about
  user privacy.

<p>Amazon is killing a privacy feature to bolster Alexa+, the new subscription assistant.</p>

<figure></figure><figure></figure><p>Since Amazon announced plans for a generative AI version of Alexa, we were <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/09/amazons-generative-ai-powered-alexa-is-as-big-a-privacy-red-flag-as-old-alexa/">concerned about user privacy</a>. With <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/amazons-subscription-based-alexa-looks-highly-capable-and-questionable/">Alexa+</a> rolling out to Amazon Echo devices in the coming weeks, we’re getting a clearer view at the privacy concessions people will have to make to maximize usage of the AI voice assistant and avoid bricking functionality of already-purchased devices.</p>
<p>In an email sent to customers today, Amazon said that Echo users will no longer be able to set their devices to process Alexa requests locally and, therefore, avoid sending voice recordings to Amazon’s cloud. Amazon apparently sent the email to users with “Do Not Send Voice Recordings” enabled on their Echo. Starting on March 28, recordings of everything spoken to the Alexa living in Echo speakers and smart displays will automatically be sent to Amazon and processed in the cloud.</p>
<p>Attempting to rationalize the change, Amazon’s email said:</p>
<blockquote><p>As we continue to expand Alexa’s capabilities with generative AI features that rely on the processing power of Amazon’s secure cloud, we have decided to no longer support this feature.</p></blockquote>
<p>One of the most marketed features of Alexa+ is its more advanced ability to recognize who is speaking to it, a feature known as Alexa Voice ID. To accommodate this feature, Amazon is eliminating a privacy-focused capability for all Echo users, even those who aren’t interested in the subscription-based version of Alexa or want to use Alexa+ but not its ability to recognize different voices.</p>
<p>However, there are plenty of reasons why people wouldn't want Amazon to receive recordings of what they say to their personal device. For one, the idea of a conglomerate being able to listen to personal requests made in your home is, simply, unnerving.</p>
<p>Further, Amazon has previously mismanaged Alexa voice recordings. In 2023, Amazon agreed to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/31/technology/amazon-25-million-childrens-privacy.html">pay $25 million</a> in civil penalties over the revelation that it stored recordings of children’s interactions with Alexa forever. Adults also didn’t feel properly informed of Amazon’s <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/07/amazon-confirms-it-keeps-your-alexa-recordings-basically-forever/">inclination toward keeping Alexa recordings</a> unless prompted not to until 2019—five years after the first Echo came out.</p>
<p>If that's not enough to deter you from sharing voice recordings with Amazon, note that the company allowed <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/04/amazon-admits-that-employees-review-small-sample-of-alexa-audio/">employees to listen to Alexa voice recordings.</a> In 2019, Bloomberg reported that Amazon employees listened to as many as 1,000 audio samples during their nine-hour shifts. Amazon <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201602230">says</a> it allows employees to listen to Alexa voice recordings to train its speech recognition and natural language understanding systems.</p>
<p>Other reasons why people may be hesitant to trust Amazon with personal voice samples include the previous usage of Alexa voice recordings <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/11/amazon-must-give-up-echo-recordings-in-double-murder-case-judge-rules/">in criminal trials </a>and Amazon <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/06/ftc-amazon-ring-workers-illegally-spied-on-users-of-home-security-cameras/">paying a settlement</a> in 2023 in relation to allegations that it allowed "thousands of employees and contractors to watch video recordings of customers' private spaces" taken from Ring cameras, per the Federal Trade Commission.</p>
<h2>Save recordings or lose functionality</h2>
<p>Likely looking to get ahead of these concerns, Amazon said in its email today that by default, it will delete recordings of users’ Alexa requests after processing. However, anyone with their Echo device set to “Don’t save recordings” will see their already-purchased devices’ Voice ID feature bricked. Voice ID <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GYCXKY2AB2QWZT2X">enables Alexa</a> to do things like share user-specified calendar events, reminders, music, and more. Previously, Amazon <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201602230">has said</a> that "if you choose not to save any voice recordings, Voice ID may not work." As of March 28, broken Voice ID is a guarantee for people who don't let Amazon store their voice recordings.</p>
<p>Amazon's email says:</p>
<blockquote><p>Alexa voice requests are always encrypted in transit to Amazon’s secure cloud, which was designed with layers of security protections to keep customer information safe. Customers can continue to choose from a robust set of controls by visiting the Alexa Privacy dashboard online or navigating to More &gt; Alexa Privacy in the Alexa app.</p></blockquote>
<p>Amazon is forcing Echo users to make a couple of tough decisions: Grant Amazon access to recordings of everything you say to Alexa or stop using an Echo; let Amazon save voice recordings and have employees listen to them or lose a feature set to become more advanced and central to the next generation of Alexa.</p>
<p>However, Amazon is betting big that Alexa+ can dig the voice assistant out of a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/07/alexa-had-no-profit-timeline-cost-amazon-25-billion-in-4-years/">financial pit</a>. Amazon has publicly committed to keeping the free version of Alexa around, but Alexa+ is viewed as Amazon's last hope for keeping Alexa alive and making it profitable. Anything Amazon can do to get people to pay for Alexa takes precedence over other Alexa user demands, including, it seems, privacy.</p>
