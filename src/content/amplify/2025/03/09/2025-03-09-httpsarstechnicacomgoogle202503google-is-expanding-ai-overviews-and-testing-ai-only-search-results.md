  Google is expanding its AI search features, introducing AI Overviews and
  testing a new AI Mode that eliminates traditional search links. This AI Mode
  uses advanced reasoning to provide answers directly, but it's currently only
  available to Google One AI Premium subscribers. While Google aims to improve
  AI search, the feature is still experimental and may not always deliver
  accurate results.

<figure></figure><figure></figure><p>Google has become so integral to online navigation that its name became a verb, meaning "to find things on the Internet." Soon, Google might just <em>tell</em> you what's on the Internet instead of showing you. The company has <a href="https://blog.google/products/search/ai-mode-search/">announced</a> an expansion of its AI search features, powered by Gemini 2.0. Everyone will soon see more AI Overviews at the top of the results page, but Google is also testing a more substantial change in the form of AI Mode. This version of Google won't show you the 10 blue links at all—Gemini completely takes over the results in AI Mode.</p>
<p>This marks the debut of Gemini 2.0 in Google search. Google announced the first Gemini 2.0 models <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/12/google-goes-agentic-with-gemini-2-0s-ambitious-ai-agent-features/">in December 2024</a>, beginning with the streamlined Gemini 2.0 Flash. The heavier versions of Gemini 2.0 are still in testing, but Google says it has tuned AI Overviews with this model to offer help with harder questions in the areas of math, coding, and multimodal queries.</p>
<p>With this update, you will begin seeing AI Overviews on more results pages, and minors with Google accounts will see AI results for the first time. In fact, even logged out users will see AI Overviews soon. This is a big change, but it's only the start of Google's plans for AI search.</p>
<p>Gemini 2.0 also powers the new AI Mode for search. It's launching as an opt-in feature via Google's Search Labs, offering a totally new alternative to search as we know it. This custom version of the Gemini large language model (LLM) skips the standard web links that have been part of every Google search thus far. The model uses "advanced reasoning, thinking, and multimodal capabilities" to build a response to your search, which can include web summaries, Knowledge Graph content, and shopping data. It's essentially a bigger, more complex AI Overview.</p>
<p>As Google has previously pointed out, many searches are questions rather than a string of keywords. For those kinds of queries, an AI response could <em>theoretically</em> provide an answer more quickly than a list of 10 blue links. However, that relies on the AI response being useful and accurate, something that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/05/googles-ai-overview-can-give-false-misleading-and-dangerous-answers/">often still eludes generative AI systems like Gemini</a>.</p>
<p>Google insists this is not the end of web search, saying that helping people discover content online "remains central" to its approach. Indeed, the examples Google shows include links and citations from around the web similar to AI Overviews. However, you can't just scroll down in AI Mode to see organic results. Instead, AI Mode is designed to operate in a conversational way, allowing you to refine your search or ask follow-up questions.</p>

<p>If this sounds like something you absolutely do not want, you can safely ignore it for now. The experimental feature is only available for Google One AI Premium subscribers, who pay $20 per month for access to Google's best LLMs. This could be an indication that generating these search pages is extremely costly even for a company that gives away so much AI processing for free. Still, Google's AI efforts move fast, and you could find yourself confronted with AI Mode soon. It only took a few months for the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/03/google-search-will-start-automatically-showing-a-chatbot-to-some-users/">Search Generative Experience</a> to graduate from Labs as AI Overviews.</p>
<p>Google notes that it still has a lot of work to do before AI Mode is ready for prime time—it's a dramatic departure for a core part of the Google experience, after all. Google says the AI-only searches might not always be able to offer a good rundown. In those instances, it will fall back to showing you traditional links to websites that can answer your questions. AI Mode may also appear to take on a persona or form an opinion like a chatbot while it's still in development.</p>
<p>The feedback from the public test will help Google address AI Mode's shortcomings and make rapid changes to the experience. If you want to check out AI Mode, you can <a href="https://labs.google.com/search/experiment/22">join the waitlist in Search Labs</a>. If not, it's probably only a matter of time before you have no choice. No one was exactly clamoring for AI Overviews, but that hasn't stopped Google from pushing it to ever more searches.</p>
