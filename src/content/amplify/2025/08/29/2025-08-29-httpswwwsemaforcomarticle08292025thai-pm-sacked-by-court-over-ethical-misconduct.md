<p>Thailand’s constitutional court sacked the country’s prime minister, throwing the country into renewed political turmoil.</p>
<p>Paetongtarn Shinawatra was <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/29/thai-court-removes-prime-minister-paetongtarn-shinawatra-from-office">removed from office</a> over ethical misconduct surrounding a leaked phone call with Cambodia’s former leader in which she was critical of her nation’s military following a border dispute with Phnom Penh.</p>
<p>Critics argue Thailand’s military and royalist establishment undermine political parties and elected governments through court cases: Paetongtarn — the daughter of ex-Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who is himself embroiled in a legal battle in Thailand — is the fifth premier to be removed by justices since 2008, and it is now unclear who will replace her.</p>
