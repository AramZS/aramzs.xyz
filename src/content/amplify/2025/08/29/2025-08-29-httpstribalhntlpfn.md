<p>With all the frenzied news swirling around these days, it's understandable if you let Elon Musk slip from the top of your mind.</p>
<p>While the billionaire's mental state was <a href="https://futurism.com/elon-black-eye-drug-claims">arguably frayed</a> during his stint as DOGE czar — thanks in no small part to what's been reported as a <a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/elon-musk-traveling-box-drugs">constant stream</a> of illicit drugs — it's become visibly more concerning since his <a href="https://futurism.com/trump-administration-elon-musk-views">dramatic departure</a> earlier this summer.</p>
<p>Seemingly trying to distract himself from the <a href="https://futurism.com/tesla-shutting-down-ai-supercomputer">decline of Tesla</a>, the world's richest man has embarked on a number of bizarre side projects to fill the days, including an anti-Microsoft company called "<a href="https://qz.com/elon-musk-macrohard-to-challenge-microsoft">Macrohard</a>," and an anti-establishment political party known as the "<a href="https://futurism.com/elon-musk-tesla-board-america">America Party</a>."</p>
<p>But as the notoriously fickle billionaire already seems to be <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/elon-musk-third-political-party-69bf9bd8?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=ASWzDAgpRLSlvLXtvQCtrbXG-20-wajDyISR2zDIrCuSu0HICoW3Es5SKTJcvPtv6RU%3D&amp;gaa_ts=68b0b599&amp;gaa_sig=rb5VIWo7utlNMWl5xLHrNR_mDiQeit168qHViBSLbYcYokkmmPf35KDAicNJX0pkAP5OzhicBw-IkIBMVyRDow%3D%3D">losing interest</a> in those noble pursuits, concerns are growing that Musk is becoming sexually involved with his very own chatbot, Grok.</p>
<p>A topic first explored <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/elon-musk-grok-anime-porn-1235415287/">by <em>Rolling Stone</em></a>, Musk's posts on X have become increasing frisky in recent weeks. While his tweeting habits were never exactly PG, the tech magnate has made it a point to show off Grok's more risqué image generation abilities, sharing scenes of scantily glad <a href="https://x.com/Preda2005/status/1959667309355937824">Colombian twins</a>, or a <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1959490993805271223">topless woman</a> bedazzled with space dust.</p>
<p>"Wow. And this is just Grok Imagine beta v0.1!" Musk exclaimed to his 225 million followers, along with a <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1959488366782943445">4 minute compilation</a> of a young-looking cartoon woman wearing various skin-tight spacesuits.</p>
<p>Beneath his racy Grok smut, commenters bristled with disappointment and annoyance.</p>
<p>"Why do you have to sexualize a chat bot like Grok?" <a href="https://x.com/Mathonymics/status/1959489873456603508">one user asked</a>. Another fan <a href="https://x.com/jfeilders/status/1959723376643293233">complained</a> that it's hard to take Grok's development seriously when its main use seems to be generating porn.</p>
<p>One reply guy <a href="https://x.com/EmbracingTara/status/1959488842618011949">challenged Musk</a> to go just one day without posting gooner bait.</p>
<p>"All he does is post AI soft porn anymore," another poster shrugged. "I don't think he's coping well with getting sidelined by the Trump administration."</p>
<p>Even sadder than Musk's apparent obsession with his personal sex bot is the cost it takes to run the thing. It takes an <a href="https://promptengineering.org/grok-3-elon-musks-ai-power-play-or-just-another-tech-flex/">inordinate amount of energy</a> to power Grok, and the civilian grid connected to Musk's data centers in Memphis is struggling to keep up. To compensate, the billionaire is operating some <a href="https://futurism.com/elon-musk-memphis-illegal-generators">15 methane gas generators</a>, which residents say are choking their neighborhoods with noxious smog.</p>
<p>Evidently, it's a price Musk's willing to make others pay so he can enjoy some synthetic skin flicks.</p>
