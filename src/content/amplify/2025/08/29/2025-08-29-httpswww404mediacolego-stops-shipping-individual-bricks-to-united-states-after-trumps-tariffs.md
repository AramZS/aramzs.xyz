<p>Add LEGO to the list of hobbies that Trump has made more expensive and worse <a href="https://www.404media.co/trump-tariffs-cause-chaos-on-ebay-having-a-hobby-is-now-a-logistical-nightmare/"><u>with his tariff policy</u></a>. Thanks to America’s ever shifting trade policies, LEGO has stopped shipping more than 2,500 pieces from its Pick a Brick program to both the United States and Canada.</p>
<figure></figure><figure></figure><p>Pick a Brick allows LEGO fans to buy individual bricks, which is important in the fandom because certain pieces are hard to come by or are crucial to build specific types of creations. LEGO, a Danish company, says that program will no longer be available to Americans and Canadians.</p>
<p>LEGO fansite New Elementary <a href="https://www.newelementary.com/2025/08/pick-brick-standard-bricks-service.html?ref=404media.co"><u>first noticed</u></a> the change on August 25, four days ahead of the August 29 elimination of the de minimis trade exemption in the US. Many of the individual LEGO bricks in the Pick a Brick collection cost less than a dollar and it’s likely that the the elimination of the de minimis rule, which waived import fees on goods valued less than $800, made the Pick a Brick program untenable.</p>
<p>Some LEGO sets are simple boxes of a few pieces and others are vast and complicated reconstructions of pop culture icons that use thousands of individual bricks. The LEGO Millenium Falcon, for example, uses more than <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/millennium-falcon-75192?ef_id=Cj0KCQjwn8XFBhCxARIsAMyH8BsMUg484SeJU_c44WiJHEmLNcI8bzrG7lnajc48KCwZEMU54RfXIEUaAlo2EALw_wcB%3AG%3As&amp;s_kwcid=AL%21790%213%21%21%21%21x%21%21%2119930801844%21&amp;cmp=KAC-INI-GOOGUS-GO-US_GL-EN-RE-SP-BUY-CREATE-MB_ALWAYS_ON-SHOP-BP-PMAX-ALL-CIDNA00000-PMAX-MEDIUM_PRIORITY&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=19930807088&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwn8XFBhCxARIsAMyH8BsMUg484SeJU_c44WiJHEmLNcI8bzrG7lnajc48KCwZEMU54RfXIEUaAlo2EALw_wcB&amp;ref=404media.co"><u>7,000 individual pieces.</u></a> When a specific piece goes missing it can be hard to replace. To service that need, third party services like <a href="https://www.bricklink.com/searchAdvanced.asp?ref=404media.co"><u>BrickLink </u></a>sell allow people to purchase individual pieces. LEGO’s in-house version of this is its <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/pick-and-build/pick-a-brick?cmp=KAC-INI-GOOGUS-GO-US_GL-EN-RE-PS-BUY-CREATE-LEGO_GENERAL-SHOP-BC-MM-ALL-CIDNA00000-OTHER-PICK_A_BRICK&amp;ef_id=Cj0KCQjwn8XFBhCxARIsAMyH8BsQ0M-QPLAuxV9rui1PVNn-DBxB8R5M1nkiKfdY2CvvNiNWtKjDutYaAj-tEALw_wcB%3AG%3As&amp;gad_campaignid=20593645573&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwn8XFBhCxARIsAMyH8BsQ0M-QPLAuxV9rui1PVNn-DBxB8R5M1nkiKfdY2CvvNiNWtKjDutYaAj-tEALw_wcB&amp;s_kwcid=AL%21790%213%21675177432858%21e%21%21g%21%21lego+pick+a+brick%2120593645573%21153977916957&amp;ref=404media.co"><u>Pick a Brick store</u></a>, a place where enthusiasts could choose from thousands of different individual LEGOs and buy them piece by piece, usually for less than a dollar each.</p>
<p>A small subset of the Pick a Brick pieces, around 1,500 of them the store calls its bestsellers, are shipped to the United States from a warehouse in America. But the “standard” collection of less popular pieces ship from Denmark, where LEGO is headquartered. Those pieces, more than 2,000 of them according to fans, are no longer available in the United States and Canada.</p>
<p>The Pick a Brick website called this a service pause. “In the US &amp; Canada, Standard pieces are temporarily unavailable. You can still shop our Bestseller range which includes thousands of the most popular bricks and pieces ready to order,” said a message at the top of the site.</p>
<p>LEGO fans online said that they saw their shopping carts emptied in the middle of building projects. “This is annoying. I just set up a big PAB order and then saved it. I just looked and 18 of my items are no longer available,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/lego/comments/1n011ag/comment/nans1j6/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><u>a comment in the r/LEGO</u></a> community said.</p>
<p>“My whole Standard cart was wiped out... regret not ordering now. Had a lot of dual molded legs in there for Star Wars figure boot upgrades, looks like they're all gone now,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/lego/comments/1n011ag/comment/nanfrpe/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><u>said another</u></a>.</p>
<p>Others were upset that Canada was lumped in with the United States. “Why are we being caught up in Trump’s tariff shitstorm??? Ship the [Pick a Brick] orders straight to Toronto or something! We’re practically neighbours. We even share a land border with Denmark now,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/lego/comments/1n011ag/comment/nanh14l/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><u>one commenter said</u></a>.“This is inherently unfair to Canadian buyers like myself. I primarily stick to lego trains, so now if I want to do any more custom builds, I need to search harder to get what I used to on PAB. Glad I got my last order in before this happened, it sucks that there's no Canadian warehouses,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/lego/comments/1n011ag/comment/nao0x4a/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><u>said another</u></a>.</p>
<p>The de minimis rule officially ended Friday, and we’re only just beginning to understand the ripple effects that change will have on the American economy. The only thing that is certain is that everything is getting more expensive and complicated. Some national mail carriers have stopped shipping to the U.S. entirely. Companies that move electronics, board games, and other small items on eBay are <a href="https://www.404media.co/trump-tariffs-cause-chaos-on-ebay-having-a-hobby-is-now-a-logistical-nightmare/"><u>worried about the future</u></a>.</p>
<p>The de minimis rule waived fees on more than <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/08/28/nx-s1-5519361/de-minimis-rule-tariffs-consumers-imports-trump?utm_campaign=npr&amp;utm_term=nprnews&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=bsky.app"><u>4 million packages</u></a> every year, some of those were small amounts of plastic LEGO pieces. For now, LEGO fans in the US will have to find workarounds.</p>
<p>LEGO did not respond to 404 Media’s request for comment.</p>
