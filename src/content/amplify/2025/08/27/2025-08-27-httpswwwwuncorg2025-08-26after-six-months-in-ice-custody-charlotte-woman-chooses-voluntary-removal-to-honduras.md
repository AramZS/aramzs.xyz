<p>A 20-year-old Honduran woman who has lived in the Charlotte area for more than a decade will soon be removed from the U.S. after choosing voluntary removal following months in custody.</p>
<p>Allison Bustillo-Chinchilla has been in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody for six months. Bustillo-Chinchilla appeared in a final hearing via Webex on Tuesday, where she informed the court that she wished to withdraw her asylum petition and leave the country voluntarily.</p>
<p>Bustillo-Chinchilla moved to North Carolina from Honduras when she was 8 years old. She graduated from Crest High School in Shelby and earned a scholarship to attend Gardner-Webb University, with hopes of becoming a nurse.</p>
<p>Those dreams were cut short in February, when ICE agents detained Bustillo-Chinchilla, her mother and her brother, all of whom are undocumented, at their east Charlotte home.</p>
<p>Bustillo-Chinchilla's mother and her brother were later released so they could care for her two younger siblings, but she remained in custody and was transferred to Stewart Detention Center in Georgia.</p>
<p>Keily Chinchilla, Bustillo-Chinchilla's mother, told WFAE the jail's conditions prompted her daughter to ask for voluntary removal.</p>
<p>"I feel disappointed," Keily Chinchilla said. "I feel tired, and it's very difficult because I won't be able to see her leave the country."</p>
<p>Bustillo-Chinchilla will stay in ICE custody until she is released for voluntary removal to Honduras.</p>
