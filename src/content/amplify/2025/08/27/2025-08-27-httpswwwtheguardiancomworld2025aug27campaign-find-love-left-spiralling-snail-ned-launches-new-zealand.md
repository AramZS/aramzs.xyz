<h2 data-gu-name="standfirst">Nearly all common garden snails have shells that coil to the right but Ned the snail’s left-spiralling shell results in reversed reproductive organs – a barrier to mating</h2>
<p>If you thought your dating pool was limited, spare a thought for Ned, a very rare snail unearthed in <a data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/newzealand">New Zealand</a>. Due to a left-spiralling shell, Ned has a vanishingly small chance of finding a mate – a predicament that has sparked a nationwide campaign.</p>
<p>Nearly all common garden snails have shells that coil to the right but Ned’s left-spiralling shell is like a mirror image, resulting in a flipped shell and reversed reproductive organs – a configuration that affects <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsbl.2020.0110">roughly 1 in 40,000 snails</a>.</p>
<p>Snails with shells and reproductive organs on the opposite side cannot mate with each other, so unless another similarly built snail is found, Ned will be forced to live a life of celibacy.</p>
<p>Ned – named after The Simpson’s famous left-handed neighbour Ned Flanders – was discovered last week in a back garden in Wairarapa, an hour north of Wellington.</p>
<p>Illustrator and author Giselle Clarkson was digging up vegetables in her garden when a snail dropped into the dirt. She was about to toss it away when she noticed something was a bit off.</p>
<p>“Something was different but I couldn’t figure it out – the first thought that went through my mind was that it was a different species,” she tells the Guardian. She soon realised that the snail’s shell coiled on the left.</p>
<p>“After you see something thousands and thousands of times looking one way, and then you suddenly see it the other way around, it is quite uncanny.”</p>
<p>Clarkson had become familiar with left-spiralling snails through her work at New Zealand Geographic magazine and immediately knew she was dealing with something special.</p>
<p>She made Ned a home in a fishbowl and contacted the magazine with her find. They have since launched a <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.nzgeo.com/stories/lets-find-a-mate-for-ned/">national campaign</a> to find Ned a mate.</p>
<p>The campaign urges people in New Zealand to rummage around their gardens and parks for left-coiled snails, and asks anyone who is lucky enough to find one to get in touch.</p>
<p>Ned may be rare, but his plight is not the first to garner attention. In 2017, an international search was launched to find a mate for Jeremy, another lonely lefty discovered in London. Two eligible left-sided mates were discovered but made headlines when they ended up <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/may/19/jeremy-the-lonely-left-coiling-snail-loses-out-in-love-triangle">coupling with each other instead</a>. Jeremy eventually mated with one of the pair and produced offspring with exclusively right-spiralling shells, before dying, <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/20/snail-in-the-coffin-left-coiling-mollusc-jeremy-dies-after-finding-love">aged two</a>.</p>
<p>Ned is a common garden snail, an introduced species that is considered a pest in New Zealand’s gardens. Some gardeners may raise their eyebrows at trying to boost their population – even if it is by just a handful – but the campaign has a broader purpose.</p>
<p>“We’re all about trying to connect people with the environment,” said Catherine Woulfe, New Zealand Geographic editor.</p>
<p>“[It] is light and fun but we hope it’s also a doorway into deeper topics like gardening, understanding the natural world, and the weird intricacies of reproduction,” she said.</p>
<p>This month, a study revealed human connection to nature had <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/aug/09/human-connection-to-nature-has-declined-60-in-200-years-study-finds">declined by 60% in 200 years</a> and introducing children to nature, as well as greening urban spaces were some of the best methods to help reverse the decline.</p>
<p>“For the last two nights my kids have happily put on their gumboots and head torches and spent half an hour pottering around the garden, snail-hunting in the dark,” Woulfe said. “That feels like a win.”</p>
