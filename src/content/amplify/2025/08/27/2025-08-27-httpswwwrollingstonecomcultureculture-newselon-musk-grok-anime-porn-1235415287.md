title: Elon Musk Appears to Be Completely Addicted to Anime Gooner AI Slop

<p>Since his exit from the <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/white-house/">White House</a> and spectacular fallout with <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/donald-trump/">Donald Trump</a>, <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/elon-musk/">Elon Musk</a> has been posting a lot less about far-right politics and conspiracy theories. Instead, the world’s richest man has seemingly turned at least some of his scattered attention back to his many businesses, including <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/tesla/">Tesla</a>, <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/spacex/">SpaceX</a>, and <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/xai">xAI</a>. His newly founded “<a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/elon-musk-trump-breakup-america-party-1235379393/">America Party</a>,” meant to challenge both Democrats and Republicans, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/elon-musk-third-political-party-69bf9bd8?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=ASWzDAjC9H54gSimsC62PfYDe1UiesdpnDgJEMXLkeMIuFb_qSBPFb10nQtU3Z9idhY%3D&amp;gaa_ts=68ade5e7&amp;gaa_sig=_1Plwi1jOIZ7tuUOHE3UNtlKffCrIKSFNXFTcGXZN1gKP4gZqWi8H5L8WNDJdRlT8JNIEz9JV6NkrgEE9WYHyw%3D%3D">remains inactive</a>. All this no doubt comes as a relief to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-investors-message-for-elon-musk-stay-away-from-politics-2025-7">board members at those companies</a> who worried that Washington drama and Musk’s exploits as the head of the so-called <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/doge/">Department of Government Security</a> put his tech empire at <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/musk-tesla-backlash-protest-1235288504/">unnecessary risk</a>.</p>
<p>But Musk’s return to full-time brand promotion has not been without its questionable moments. He is particularly committed to pushing xAI’s chatbot <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/grok/">Grok</a> as a superior alternative to rivals such as <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/openai">OpenAI</a>‘s <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/chatgpt/">ChatGPT</a>, despite the product being perhaps best known for briefly identifying itself as “<a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/elon-musk-grok-chatbot-antisemitic-posts-1235381165/">MechaHitler</a>” while it spouted Nazi views. On Monday, xAI even went so far as <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/25/musk-lawsuit-apple-openai-monopoly.html">suing Apple and OpenAI</a>, with a filing that accused the corporations of an anticompetitive scheme to suppress Grok in the App Store while favoring ChatGPT. (Apple and OpenAI have entered into a partnership that allows the computer and smartphone giant to integrate the bot into its products.) In the meantime, Musk has been left to make the case himself that Grok is a most advanced model available. He is prone to ambiguous, sweeping, impressive-sounding statements about the technology, claiming that the current version, Grok 4, may “<a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/elon-musk-grok-4-ai-chatbot-claims-new-technologies-1235382228/">discover new technologies</a>” by the end of 2025 (there have been no reports of such) and is “the smartest AI in the world” (the data <a href="https://futurism.com/grok-4-ai-leaderboard">tells a different story</a>).</p>
<p>When he isn’t hyping the bot in those terms, however, he mostly touts how users can leverage Grok to create moving images of attractive women, dictating elements of their appearance including skin, eye, and hair color, as well as what clothes they wear and what sort of environments they inhabit. In recent weeks, Musk has been especially eager to show off “Ani” on his X account. One of several “companions” that you can interact with through Grok, she is a scantily clad female <a data-tag="anime" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/anime/">anime</a> character who can undress and is designed to respond to flirtatious conversation with increasingly intimate responses. Now, Musk also frequently reposts similarly sexualized cartoon characters generated with Grok’s text-to-video feature, “Imagine.” It’s gotten to the point where many have openly wondered if he fetishizes these virtual women.</p>
<p>Over the weekend, for example, Musk reposted an animation made by one of his reply guys of an <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1959490993805271223">evidently topless woman</a> whose face, neck, and shoulders are bejeweled by blinking stars and swirling galaxies. He shared an <a href="https://x.com/Preda2005/status/1959667309355937824">animation</a> from another paid blue-check X user who explained he had prompted Grok to show him a “stunning Colombian woman” with a “golden tan” and “flawless smooth complexion” in a revealing tribal-style leather getup, standing next to a large robotic dinosaur. He also marveled at a sort of music video for Simple Minds’ “Don’t You (Forget About Me)” made with Grok, which featured a series of shots of a dark-haired, anime-like character in different skintight spacesuits (and one bathing suit). “Wow,” Musk <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1959488366782943445">wrote</a>. “And this is just Grok Imagine beta v0.1! Not even Imagine version 1.”</p>
<p>The billionaire’s affinity for titillating cartoon characters has not gone unnoticed on X. The comments on that music video included one critic replying: “<a href="https://x.com/EmbracingTara/status/1959488842618011949">Don’t post AI soft porn for at least one day challenge</a>.” Others made jokes about Musk using Grok as a <a href="https://x.com/BrianChiwax/status/1959529690940510485">masturbation aid</a>, expressed their <a href="https://x.com/Spiritual_A_J/status/1959607989104480631">disappointment</a> in what a supposedly innovative genius was spending his time on, and predicted that such content would have a <a href="https://x.com/haralabob/status/1959527295959405030">negative effect</a> on society. “This is just more gooner slop,” <a href="https://x.com/tractor_owner/status/1959627009060921412">complained</a> one detractor. (“Gooning” is internet slang that describes exaggerated and excessively long sessions of self-pleasuring.)</p>
<p>In other recent posts, Musk urged followers to try the sometimes-pornographic companion Ani. Last week, he announced that <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1958073694095654979">new skimpy outfits</a> had been added to her wardrobe and commented “<a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1958489981393232181">Nice</a>” when a user modeled her in one. He evidently crossed a line, though, when he posted an animation of Ani <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EnoughMuskSpam/comments/1mwbmq6/its_all_porn_isnt_it/#lightbox">dancing in her underwear</a>; even his right-wing fans were disgusted, telling him it was “<a href="https://x.com/creation247/status/1958942770292256798">time to stop</a>” and that Ani looked like a “<a href="https://x.com/peridot_bleu/status/1959092244306124837">13 year old in lingerie</a>.” Musk, likely observing the severe backlash, deleted the offending post. Yet he continued to annoy his supporters by engaging with Ani. When he replied to a video of the character in a short skirt and a see-through top with a “good morning” message and an emoji of a smiling face encircled by hearts, a fed-up X user <a href="https://x.com/loffydotsol/status/1958501899042259270">wrote</a>, “BRO STOP GOONING TO AI ANIME AND TAKE US TO MARS.”</p>
<p>Musk’s infatuation with Ani and similar anime pin-ups has led some fans to seek his attention by catering to his tastes. A Tesla owner for instance, tagged him in a <a href="https://x.com/mooroobee/status/1958670405092126868">post </a>where a cartoon woman in a bikini holds a sign inquiring about a future update to their car’s automated driver assistance system. “Smart, Elon will definitely see this,” theorized a Tesla influencer who shared a <a href="https://x.com/DirtyTesLa/status/1958695725090386268">different question</a> about the <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/cybertruck/">Cybertruck</a>, presented in the same bikini-babe-with-a-sign format. “Let’s use this format for all questions to Elon going forward,” they suggested. Musk eventually did acknowledge one of these images with his favorite emoji — the <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1958855159083409601">laugh-crying face</a>. He also directly answered a SpaceX enthusiast who last week <a href="https://x.com/xdNiBoR/status/1958627783493464110">shared</a> a clip of Ani in lingerie carrying a sign that asked when he expected a technical update to the company’s Starship rocket. “Sunday,” Musk <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1958650651442909306">replied</a>.</p>
<p>Will his ongoing emphasis on Grok’s erotic capabilities turn it into the leading chatbot of its time, or just endear it to a limited demographic of lonely, like-minded men while alienating much of the public? Maybe that’s a question for AI. But in the absence of more impressive output, Musk is more or less stuck trying impress people with digital smut. Don’t be surprised if it gets raunchier still from here.</p>
