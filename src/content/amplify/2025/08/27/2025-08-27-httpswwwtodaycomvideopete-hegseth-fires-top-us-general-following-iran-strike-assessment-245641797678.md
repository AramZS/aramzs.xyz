  Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Friday fired the general who angered
  President Donald Trump over his damage assessment of United States strikes on
  Iran. Officials gave no reason for the firing of Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Kruse, the
  head of the Pentagon’s Defense Intelligence Agency. Kruse's firing follows a
  June assessment by the agency that strikes against Iran’s nuclear facilities
  had only set their nuclear program back several months.
