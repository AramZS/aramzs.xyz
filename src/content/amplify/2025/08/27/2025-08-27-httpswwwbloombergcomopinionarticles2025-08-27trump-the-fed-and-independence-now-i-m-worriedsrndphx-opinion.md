Now I’m much more worried. I think markets should be, too.</p><p>It’s too soon to reach any firm conclusion about how the president’s move to oust Fed Governor Lisa Cook will play out. Dismissal “for cause” will entail lengthy court proceedings, and is likely to require evidence of malfeasance or neglect in the conduct of her official duties. Even if proven, the administration’s claim — that Cook violated the law before her time in office by designating two different homes as her primary residence when applying for mortgages — probably wouldn’t meet the test.</p><p>Nonetheless, the attack on Cook represents a major escalation that could end very badly. Never before has a president tried to fire a Fed governor, and there’s much more at stake than one person’s job. If Cook goes, Trump will soon have appointed four of the central bank’s seven governors — a majority. This wouldn’t immediately allow him to exert control over the Federal Open Market Committee, whose 12 voting members set monetary policy. It would, though, provide the president with more leverage. The Board of Governors could, for example, refuse to reappoint some or all of the 12 regional Federal Reserve Bank presidents, whose five-year terms come up for renewal in February 2026 — and five of whom vote on the FOMC on a rotating basis. In theory, this could be a way to populate the FOMC with members that would do Trump’s bidding, empowering the president to get the big rate cuts he seeks.</p><p>Granted, Trump appointees wouldn’t necessarily do what the president wants. Their allegiance could shift towards maintaining the effectiveness of the central bank that they work for. In particular, the two existing Trump-appointed governors, Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller, might balk at undermining an institution to which they’ve devoted considerable time and effort. Certainly they understand that refusing to reappoint Fed presidents who don’t favor cutting interest rates sharply would be a nuclear option, severely undermining their own credibility in the execution of monetary policy.</p><p>Whatever the outcome, the potential for standoffs, showdowns, chaos and uncertainty would be truly frightening. If Trump gained the power to reject and select regional Fed presidents via the Board of Governors, each reserve bank’s board of directors would face the difficult political question of whom to appoint. Some might acquiesce, others resist. In the latter case, the Board could conceivably threaten to cut budgets or shift responsibilities to more amenable reserve banks. FOMC meetings and Fed policymaker discourse could become acrimonious — not a good look for a central bank.</p><p>So far, investors seem to be taking developments in stride. Long-term Treasury yields are slightly higher, expectations of interest-rate cuts have increased slightly and the dollar has weakened a bit. All this suggests only muted concern that, as a result of Trump’s attacks, the Fed will be less committed to keeping inflation in check. </p><p>Markets are too complacent. Even if Trump stands only a small chance of taking control of the Fed, the effort itself is disruptive and the consequences of success would be dire. The threat to the Fed’s independence — along with the risk of uncontained inflation, much higher long-term borrowing costs and a significantly weaker dollar — isn’t going away.</p><p> <span><strong>More From Bloomberg Opinion:</strong></span></p><ul><li>Federal Reserve Shouldn’t <a href="https://blinks.bloomberg.com/news/stories/T1NACIGQ7L4E" target="_blank">Take</a> the Political Bait: Claudia Sahm</li><li>Firing Cook <a href="https://blinks.bloomberg.com/news/stories/T1MYFVGPWCI0" target="_blank">Won’t</a> Be Enough for What Trump Wants: John Authers</li><li>Powell Won’t <a href="https://blinks.bloomberg.com/news/stories/T1MBWSGQ7LCW" target="_blank">Save</a> the Fed With Silence: Jonathan Levin</li></ul><p> <span><strong>Want more Bloomberg Opinion?
