<p><b>Former US President Donald Trump has claimed that wind turbines off the coast of the US "are causing whales to die in numbers never seen before".</b></p>
<p>These claims have attracted significant attention on social media, where a clip of Mr Trump's speech has now been viewed more than nine million times.</p>
<p>But Mr Trump's claims are not backed up by evidence.</p>
<h2>What is being claimed? </h2>
<p>Speaking at a rally in South Carolina on Monday, Mr Trump suggested that "windmills" used to generate electricity are driving whales "crazy", and dead whales are washing ashore "on a weekly basis".</p>
<p>Some conservationists have raised concerns about <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-64375264">whale deaths near the development of an offshore wind farm off the US east coast</a>.</p>
<p>This series of strandings led some Republican lawmakers to call for a temporary halt to all development of offshore wind farms, and further research into possible links to humpback whale deaths.</p>
<p>Since then, <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/facebook/misinformation-about-recent-whale-deaths-dominated-discussions-offshore-wind-energy">hundreds of posts</a> wrongly linking wind farms to whale deaths have been spreading on social media, with hundreds of thousands of views.</p>
<h2>How many whales are dying?</h2>
<p>The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) says that, since 2016, a total of <a href="https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/marine-life-distress/2016-2023-humpback-whale-unusual-mortality-event-along-atlantic-coast">208 humpback whales</a> have been stranded along the country's east coast.</p>
<p>The problem was deemed so serious that, in 2017, the US agency dubbed it an "<a href="https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/marine-mammal-protection/marine-mammal-unusual-mortality-events">unusual mortality event</a>".</p>

<p>NOAA data shows 2023 has been one of the worst years in the last decade when it comes to humpback whale deaths in the US, with 33 strandings so far.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqtyERal5B0">speech on Monday</a>, Mr Trump claimed that "only one such whale" was killed off the coast of South Carolina "in the last 50 years".</p>
<p>But <a href="https://www.dnr.sc.gov/swap/supplemental/mammals/humpbackwhale2015.pdf">records</a> from the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources show that, since 1993, at least seven humpback whale strandings have been reported in the state.</p>
<h2>Is there evidence linking whale deaths to wind turbines?</h2>
<p>There is no evidence to back Mr Trump's suggestion that offshore wind turbines are killing whales.</p>
<p>NOAA officials carried out post-mortem examinations on about 90 humpback whales found dead since 2016.</p>
<p>Forty per cent of those deaths <a href="https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/new-england-mid-atlantic/marine-life-distress/frequent-questions-offshore-wind-and-whales?fbclid=IwAR2TXmI7xEfF89Cws7dmZJWYxkgnqTfl-nd6Fj3ql0D15bGharPlYOa_Z5c">were linked</a> to human interaction - whales becoming entangled in fishing nets, or being struck by vessels travelling through their feeding grounds.</p>
<p>In the remaining cases investigated by NOAA, other factors were listed as possible causes of death, including parasite-caused organ damage or starvation.</p>
<p>In some cases, the advanced stage of decomposition of the carcasses meant it was impossible to conclusively determine the cause of death.</p>
<p>"We know what the main threats are to humpback whales: it's very much the impact from things like fishing and ship strikes," says Rob Deaville from the Zoological Society of London's Cetacean Strandings Investigation Programme.</p>
<p>"To talk about wind farms being a problem takes away discussion around the very real threats that are a problem for those species."</p>
<p>Many other areas with high numbers of wind farms have not seen an increase in whale mortality.</p>
<p>For example, the UK is home to the world's four largest wind farms, but no humpback whale strandings there have been conclusively linked to the impact of those farms.</p>
<h2>Can offshore wind farms affect marine wildlife?</h2>
<p>NOAA says there are "no known links" between recent large whale mortality rates and offshore wind surveys. But that doesn't mean building windfarms comes at no cost for natural habitats.</p>
<p>Before offshore wind farms are built, the ocean floor needs to be surveyed by sending acoustic waves into it.</p>
<p>Some activists have, in the past, suggested that using such techniques might lead to whale deaths.</p>
<p>"There's lots of evidence that when you're putting the wind farms in place, it does generate a lot of percussive noise, and that can have an impact," says Mr Deaville.</p>
<p>"Particularly things like porpoises or dolphins, they may move out of that area while you're installing the wind farms, but then the longer-term picture: in some areas they never come back, in some they come back in larger numbers than before."</p>
