<p>Attention on Washington and GMU has grown steadily over the past several weeks, after the U.S. Departments of Education and Justice launched four investigations against the school, two of which are related to alleged racial discrimination in employment practices and another that questions the school’s DEI practices.</p>
<p>State leaders also <a data-rapid_p="31" data-ylk="slk:called for a stop;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/uva-president-exit-dems-want-092940964.html">called for a stop</a> to what they characterize as the politicization of Virginia’s colleges after the University of Virginia’s president resigned weeks before the GMU investigations launched, following downward pressure from federal education officials over the school’s DEI policies.</p>
<p>The board had scheduled a closed session meeting on Friday to discuss Washington’s performance and goals. He presented his state-of-the-institution report, “Navigating Rough Waters,” during Thursday’s annual President’s Conference and Friday’s business meeting. Washington is the first Black president in the school’s history.</p>
<p>“Regardless of how one views the events unfolding at George Mason University, today’s display of unity by the Mason community is inspiring,” Washington said in a statement. “It is a reminder of how centrally important our university is to Northern Virginia’s families and economy. For now, the community can refocus on what really matters most: in just three weeks we will welcome the incoming class of 2025, which is once again the largest, most diverse and one of the most qualified freshman classes in the history of George Mason. Fellow Patriots, you are simply the best. Let’s get back to work.”</p>
<p>The board, which had recently been <a data-rapid_p="32" data-ylk="slk:criticized;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/george-mason-professors-governing-board-173228932.html">criticized</a> by faculty members for failing to defend Washington and George Mason as they weathered the federal scrutiny, met for over three hours in closed session with Washington.</p>
<p>The 1.5% salary bonus aligns with the action proposed by the <a data-rapid_p="33" data-ylk="slk:General Assembly;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/general-assembly-delivers-bipartisan-budget-003111302.html">General Assembly</a>’s budget that was signed by Gov. Glenn Youngkin. Washington’s salary will increase to $823,452.43.</p>
<p>Board of Visitors Rector Charles Stimson commented on the impending investigations and public concerns before leaving the business meeting.</p>
<p>“We’re gonna fulfill our fiduciary duty, and at George Mason University that means everybody at the university,” Stimson said, adding that the board will “get through this” and “move onto the next level.”</p>
<h4><strong>Alumni and supporters speak out </strong></h4>
<p>Just ahead of Friday’s meeting, <a data-rapid_p="34" data-ylk="slk:Stand With Mason;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://standwithmason.com/">Stand With Mason</a>, a group of alumni and GMU supporters publicly stated their opposition to removing Washington from office. Students, faculty and other supporters also stood in the drizzling rain to protest against removing Washington.</p>
<p>In Stand With Mason’s statement, 75% of respondents said they would be concerned about the institution’s reputation if political interference led to the president’s removal. The group surveyed 411 registered voters from Northern Virginia.</p>
<p>“This data could not be clearer: Northern Virginia voters want their public universities focused on education — not politics,” said Brian Drummond, former George Mason Alumni Association President, in a statement. “The Board of Visitors’ actions are not just unpopular — they are dangerously out of step with public opinion, especially as we approach the November elections.”</p>
<p>Jimmy Hazel, former rector on the board, said before the board’s vote on Washington’s that he wouldn’t be surprised if they voted to pause on the matter, considering the outpouring of support and potential negative impact on George Mason. Hazel was part of the search committee that ultimately found Washington.</p>
<p>“They’re realizing there is more at stake than they thought, than just removing somebody from their job,” Hazel said. “From a realistic point of view, the federal investigations aren’t finished yet to take action against the president while the investigations are still ongoing; that just doesn’t make sense.”</p>

<p>Students and faculty members also feared that Washington’s removal could eliminate more initiatives and programs the president has championed. Washington said the institution has paused or terminated 50 projects due to the federal government’s restructuring.</p>
<p>Savannah Scott and Annabelle Spencer, PhD students in the history department, stood outside for around two hours before the meeting to bring awareness about what’s at stake.</p>
<p>“These things that we’ve seen either get surrendered to the federal government or given up entirely at other universities (are) highly possible here, and I think that’s really concerning to me and us,” Spencer said.</p>
<p>Scott added that Washington has remained “steadfast” in his support for university policies at the cost of upsetting others at higher levels that wish to dismantle diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. She voiced her concern that Washington might be succeeded by someone who would excessively accommodate the Trump administration.</p>
<p>DEI has been a lightning rod between political parties dating back to the post-Civil War Reconstruction era, when these types of programs were created to assist formerly enslaved Black Americans and give them a fairer chance at educational, financial and social success in American society.</p>
<p>Public demand for corporate and institutional commitments to treat all Americans fairly emerged during the pandemic in 2020 when Washington was hired. Beginning in 2020, America faced two high-profile examples of racial injustice and unequal opportunity for people of color — the murder of Black Minnesota man George Floyd at the hands of a white police officer, and the Supreme Court’s <a data-rapid_p="35" data-ylk="slk:recission;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/06/29/virginia-gop-leaders-praise-affirmative-action-ruling-schools-vow-to-keep-pursuing-diversity/">recission</a> of affirmative action policies on college campuses in 2023.</p>

<p>Republicans argue that DEI initiatives present cultural, ideological and political problems. Chief among the concerns is the threat of placing a person’s identity over achievements when determining their qualifications, and “reverse discrimination,” which they say puts the majority, white Americans, at a disadvantage.</p>
<p>During the board’s hours-long review of Washington’s performance, students and faculty members also raised signs and chanted in support of Washington and in opposition to any overreach by Trump and Youngkin, who is responsible for appointing members to the governing board.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, a circuit court judge temporarily suspended four members from serving on GMU’s board after the Virginia Senate Committee on Privileges and Elections rejected the appointees, signaling that the legislature wasn’t willing to confirm the new additions. An additional four were suspended at the University of Virginia and Virginia Military Institute. The case is expected to continue with appeals from Youngkin’s administration.</p>
<p>Tehama Lopez, a faculty member at George Mason, said on Friday she’s been following the investigations in Virginia including one that led to the departure of former UVA President Jim Ryan. Lopez said it hit home for her as a UVA graduate.</p>
<p>“It’s devastating to see what’s happened,” Lopez said. “I wish that President Ryan had not stepped down. I’m sympathetic to what he did, but I believe we need to stand firm and not acquiesce.”</p>
<h4><b>How Washington made the case for staying</b></h4>
<p>On Thursday, Washington spoke publicly to the senior leadership at George Mason, presenting the institution’s current state highlighted by the school retiring $100 million in debt and <a data-rapid_p="36" data-ylk="slk:earning;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://carnegieclassifications.acenet.edu/institution/george-mason-university/">earning</a> the designation “higher access, higher earnings” for its top-rated admissions access for Pell Grant recipients and students from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups, and the number of students receiving high earnings eight years after graduation.</p>
<p>The Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education, which assigns the ratings, manages the measurement tool to recognize and describe institutional diversity.</p>
<p>“We’re fulfilling the mission that I believe the individuals who founded this institution had in mind, to have an institution that was going to produce a workforce that could fund their needs and their growth,” Washington said on Thursday. “That mission is being fulfilled here, and we’re reaching people wherever you are. … We don’t care if you’re Black, white, Asian, or other. We put systems in place to support you no matter where you are, and it gets you to the point where you want to be. That’s why students are flocking here because they actually know it.”</p>
<p>Stimson said Thursday that the institution has worked hard to build its successful reputation, and parents considering universities should choose Mason if they want their children to succeed without significant debt.</p>

<p>“Mason isn’t going anywhere,” Stimson said on Thursday. “We are the best university for the best value, for the best outcomes in Virginia, in the DMV.”</p>
<p>Washington also talked about the school’s challenges including multiple investigations by Trump‘s administration and the federal government’s restructuring, which has cut funds for research and financial aid, economic challenges that are projected to result in job, wage, and output losses and enrollment challenges, with some non-U.S. born students <a data-rapid_p="37" data-ylk="slk:prohibited from receiving visas;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/contributions-virginia-international-students-face-092946408.html">prohibited from receiving visas</a> to attend school.</p>
<p>The U.S. House Committee on Judiciary is also investigating Mason for potentially violating the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and President Donald Trump’s executive order for institutions to dismantle diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, according to a July 29 letter.</p>
<p>Despite the challenges, Washington said Mason is one of the most efficient institutions in reducing the cost of attendance and graduating a significant portion of Virginia’s workforce.</p>
<p>Washington also presented details on the institution’s fundraising efforts and programs to support students who had dreamed of working for the federal government, as well as displaced federal workers amid the significant workforce changes.</p>
<p>“Why would we do this? Because we are an integral part of the region,” Washington said. “We want the region to be successful, we care about the region and we need it to be successful if we are going to be successful.”</p>
