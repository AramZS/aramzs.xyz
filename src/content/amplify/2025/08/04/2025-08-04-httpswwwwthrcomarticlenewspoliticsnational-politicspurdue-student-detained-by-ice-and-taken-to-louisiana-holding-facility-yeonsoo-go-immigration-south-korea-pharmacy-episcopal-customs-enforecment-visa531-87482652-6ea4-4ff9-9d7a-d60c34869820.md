<p>WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. — A 20-year-old Purdue University student has been <a href="https://www.wthr.com/article/news/local/number-of-ice-arrests-up-indiana-immigration-deportation/531-9712deec-f8b3-4d80-8918-6d459ea5913f">detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)</a> and taken to a holding facility in Louisiana.</p>
<p>Yeonsoo Go is South Korean but has been enrolled at Purdue University at the College of Pharmacy.</p>
<p>According to CNN, Go's family says her visa does not expire until December, and her hearing in Manhattan was to extend it. Her mother, Rev. Kyrie Kim, is an Episcopal priest in New York.</p>
<p>13News reached out to Purdue University about Go's situation, and the university provided a two-sentence statement:</p>
<p><em>"There have been media reports of a visa situation involving one of our students. The dean of students’ office has reached out to the student’s family."</em></p>
<p>Indiana State Rep. Chris Campbell (D-West Lafayette) represents the Purdue campus. She sent the following statement:</p>
<p><em>“This is absolutely horrifying. Yeonsoo Go is a young woman who came to the U.S. on a legal, religious worker’s dependent visa. An attorney for the Episcopal Diocese in New York, where Go’s mother serves as a priest, says that her current visa doesn’t even expire until December. Go is trying to update her paperwork; she’s following the law, but ICE grabbed her outside of court. </em></p>
<p><em>Arresting people outside of the courthouse proves that this isn’t about legal immigration. It’s even more concerning that her parents found out about her transfer to Louisiana from online records. It’s cruel. </em></p>
<p><em>Go is enrolled in the Purdue College of Pharmacy. She doesn’t have a criminal record, and she’s an active part of her community. We are lucky she’s pursuing her education at Purdue University. </em></p>
<p><em>I urge for the release of Yeonsoo Go, and a proper review of her immigration status. Treat people with dignity regardless of their status.”</em></p>
<p>Various interfaith and Episcopal groups protested in Manhattan's Federal Plaza to demand Go's release. The Diocese of New York posted a video of the demonstration.</p>
<p>Go is being held at the Richwood Correctional Center in Monroe, Louisiana. In February 2023, the Department of Homeland Security published a report that its own standards are being violated at the facility and recommending changes.</p>
<p>In 2024, the State of Louisiana sued ICE over the facility, accusing it of covering up outbreaks of antibiotic resistant diseases.</p>
<p>According to CNN, Go's family is reaching out to the government of South Korea for help for their daughter.</p>
