<p>President Donald Trump named Duffy as interim administrator in July after abruptly <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/politico-pro-space-preview/2025/06/06/moon-over-musk-00391322">withdrawing the nomination</a> of billionaire Jared Isaacman amid a spat with the nominee’s ally, Elon Musk.</p>
<p>Duffy also offered a directive to more quickly replace the International Space Station, another NASA goal. The two moves could help accelerate U.S. efforts to reach the moon and Mars — a goal that China is also pursuing.</p>
<p>The plans align with the Trump administration’s focus on crewed spaceflight. The White House has proposed a budget that would increase<a href="https://www.planetary.org/articles/nasa-2026-budget-proposal-in-charts"> human spaceflight</a> funds for 2026, even as it advocates for major slashes to other programs — including a nearly 50 percent cut for science missions.</p>
<p>The reactor directive orders the agency to solicit industry proposals for a 100 kilowatt nuclear reactor to launch by 2030, a key consideration for astronauts’ return to the lunar surface. NASA <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/centers-and-facilities/glenn/nasas-fission-surface-power-project-energizes-lunar-exploration/">previously funded research</a> into a 40 kilowatt reactor for use on the moon, with plans to <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/centers-and-facilities/glenn/nasas-fission-surface-power-project-energizes-lunar-exploration/">have a reactor ready for launch</a> by the early 2030s.</p>
<p>The first country to have a reactor could “declare a keep-out zone which would significantly inhibit the United States,” the directive states, a sign of the agency’s concern about a joint project China and Russia have launched.</p>
<p>The directive also orders NASA to designate a leader for the effort and to get industry input within 60 days. The agency is seeking companies able to launch a reactor by 2030 since that’s around the time China intends to land its first astronaut on the moon.</p>
<p>The nuclear initiative means that NASA will continue to have a hand in nuclear development even after the Pentagon’s recent cancellation of a joint program on nuclear-powered rocket engines.</p>
<p>“While the budget did not prioritize nuclear propulsion, that wasn’t because nuclear propulsion is seen as a non-worthy technology,” the NASA official said.</p>
<p>The space station directive aims to replace the <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/politico-pro-space-preview/2025/06/20/nasas-space-station-blues-00413831">aging, leaky International Space Station</a> with commercially run ones by changing how the agency awards contracts.</p>
<p>NASA plans to award at least two companies a contract within six months of the agency’s request for proposals. Officials hope to put a new station in space by 2030. Otherwise, only China would have a permanently crewed space station in orbit.</p>
<p>Several companies have risen to meet the space station demand, including Axiom Space, Vast, and Blue Origin. But lawmakers have <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/politico-pro-space-preview/2025/06/20/nasas-space-station-blues-00413831">expressed concern</a> in recent months that the agency is not moving fast enough to give them the funds they need.</p>
