<p dir="auto">Ever felt like the world’s moving too fast, and you’re stuck in a bubble watching it all zoom by? That’s the vibe Pinc Louds captures in their electrifying new single, “This Hate Hurts,” a synthpop gem that’s equal parts danceable and devastating. Fronted by Puerto Rican artist Claudi (they/them), this NYC-based experimental indie-pop outfit is serving up a raw, unfiltered take on modern life, and they’ve got legendary Strokes producer Gordon Raphael in their corner to make it hit <em>hard</em>. If you’re craving music that’s as thought-provoking as it is groove-worthy, buckle up—this track from their upcoming album <em>You Can’t Eat the Moon and Be a Werewolf Too</em> (out Aug. 15 on Needlejuice Records) is about to take you on a ride.</p><p dir="auto"><br/></p><p dir="auto"><br/></p>
<h3 dir="auto">A Synthpop Spell with a Punk Heart</h3>
<p dir="auto">“This Hate Hurts” is a sonic rollercoaster, blending gritty, Suicide-inspired electronic synths with the organic warmth of a wooden xylophone/marimba. Claudi describes the track as a reflection of their disillusionment with New York City’s isolating culture—think delivery apps, strangers for neighbors, and a world where magic feels just out of reach. The song’s lyrics, pulled straight from Claudi’s notebook, are raw and poetic, capturing that ache of feeling disconnected in a crowded city. Lines like these hit you right in the gut, wrapped in a melody that’s both hypnotic and urgent.</p>
<p dir="auto">What makes this track stand out in the crowded synthpop scene is its fearless mix of textures. The harsh, pulsating synths set a dark, almost dystopian mood, while the marimba adds an unexpected layer of warmth and physicality. Claudi explains how playing the mallet instrument is a full-body experience, letting rhythm drive the melody into a trance-like state. It’s no wonder the song feels so alive—like you’re dancing through a neon-lit subway tunnel, dodging puppets and heartbreak. The production, helmed by Gordon Raphael (known for shaping The Strokes’ iconic sound), is crisp yet chaotic, giving Pinc Louds’ punk energy room to breathe while keeping the electronica vibes tight.</p>
<p dir="auto">For fans of synthpop with a twist, “This Hate Hurts” fits right into the 2025 resurgence of genre-blending indie acts. Think of it as a cousin to the experimental edge of Animal Collective or the raw emotional pull of Billie Holiday, but with a distinctly modern, urban pulse. It’s the kind of song you’ll blast on your headphones while navigating a bustling city street, feeling every beat and lyric resonate with your own frustrations.</p>
<h3 dir="auto">Who Are Pinc Louds?</h3>
<p dir="auto">Pinc Louds, led by the enigmatic Claudi, started as a subway busking project in 2015 when they moved from Puerto Rico to NYC. Those gritty, underground performances shaped their sound—a wild mix of punk, psych-folk, art-rock, electronica, and Afro-Caribbean influences. With keyboardist/bassist Marc Mosteirin and drummer Matt Dallal, the band transformed into a full-blown spectacle, selling out venues like (le) Poisson Rouge and Joe’s Pub while building a cult following. Their live shows are pure chaos in the best way—think giant subway puppets, dance contests, and a “Watermelon God” thrown in for good measure.</p>
<p dir="auto">The band’s journey hasn’t been all glitter and marimbas, though. In 2022, Claudi hit a breaking point, stepping away from music after a mental health crisis. Their comeback in 2023 brought a rawer, more vulnerable edge to their work, and <em>This Hate Hurts</em> is a testament to that resilience. With 40,000 monthly Spotify listeners, 25,000 Instagram followers, and fans like Interpol’s Paul Banks (“Absolutely epic”) and comedian Ari Shaffir, Pinc Louds are on the cusp of something big. The Manhattan Beat even called them “the most inventive &amp; happening band to come out of NYC in 20 years.”</p>
<h3 dir="auto">Why “This Hate Hurts” Matters</h3>
<p dir="auto">In a world where indie music is leaning harder into authenticity, Pinc Louds are leading the charge. Their ability to weave personal struggles with universal themes—loneliness, disillusionment, and the search for connection—makes “This Hate Hurts” a standout. It’s not just a song; it’s a vibe, a protest, and a party all at once. The track’s release comes at a time when synthpop is making a comeback, with artists like Charli XCX and The Weeknd pushing the genre into new, experimental territory. Pinc Louds fit right into this wave, but their punky, DIY ethos and theatrical live shows set them apart.</p>
<p dir="auto">Check out the track on Spotify or catch a glimpse of their magic in the video for their earlier single “Spellbound” [link to video]. The band’s Tompkins Square Park performances during the 2020 pandemic were a lifeline for NYC’s music scene, earning them praise as the band that “saved summer” (ABC News). If you’re in NYC, keep an eye out for their next subway or park show—you might just find yourself chanting spells to a Watermelon God.</p>
