<p>We’ve all had the experience. You hear a great new song, but it’s hard to explain what makes it so special. The only way for your friends to understand is for them to listen to it themselves. Such is the case with the new single from NYC-based experimental indie-pop trio Pinc Louds. Vocalist Claudi, keyboard/bassist Marc Mosteirin and drummer Matt Dallal create art through their music, videos, and live performances, going back to when they met each other busking in the New York City subways.</p>
<p><em>This Hate Hurts</em>, the third single from their upcoming new album <em>You Can’t Eat the Moon and Be a Werewolf T</em>oo, is a glorious clash of driving synth with marimba. It’s Suicide’s <em>Ghost Rider</em> meets Violent Femmes’ <em>Gone Daddy Gone</em>. Speaking about the track, lead singer Claudi says <em>“This Hate Hurts is about being disillusioned with New York and certain kinds of people, and where our world is going, and the humans around me, and the culture of ordering everything for delivery and not knowing your neighbors, and all living in our little bubbles even though we’re surrounded by so many wonderful things and so much magic.</em>“</p>

<p>The marimba added something different to the song, but also the performance. <em>“There’s something really powerful about improvising on a mallet instrument because you’re making melodies, but it’s a lot less mental because you’re hitting it with your whole arm”</em> adds Claudi. <em>“There’s something really great about letting your full body take care of the melody and having rhythm drive the melody. I’m really into that—doing a melody and looping it, and transforming it and making variations off of it. And because it’s so repetitive, you get into this trance-like state.</em>“</p>
<p><em>You Can’t Eat the Moon and Be a Werewolf Too</em>, the new album from Pinc Louds will be released August 15 via Needlejuice Records.</p>
