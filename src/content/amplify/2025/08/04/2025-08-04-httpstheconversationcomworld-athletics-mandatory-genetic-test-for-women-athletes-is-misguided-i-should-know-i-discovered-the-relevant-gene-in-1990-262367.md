<p>World Athletics president Sebastian Coe recently announced a new rule for women athletes, requiring <a href="https://www.insidethegames.biz/articles/1154458/world-athletics-introduces-gene-test#:%7E:text=Reinforcing%20its%20stringent%20policy%20on,international%20championships%2C%20starting%20this%20September.">mandatory genetic tests</a> to verify their biological sex.</p>
<p>This test must be done if athletes wish to compete in September’s World Athletics Championships in Tokyo.</p>
<p>World Athletics has said all athletes competing as women must have an SRY gene test to identify whether a male Y chromosome is present.</p>
<p>Any athlete whose test shows the presence of the SRY gene will be banned from competing in the women’s category in elite events.</p>
<p>Coe said the decision was made to ensure “<a href="https://www.theage.com.au/sport/athletics/gender-cannot-trump-biology-world-athletics-introduced-mandatory-gender-test-20250731-p5mj53.html">the integrity of women’s sport</a>” with <a href="https://worldathletics.org/news/press-releases/sry-gene-test-athletes-female-category">World Athletics asserting</a>:</p>
<blockquote> <p>The SRY gene is a reliable proxy for determining biological sex.</p> </blockquote>
<p>I argue the science does not support this overly simplistic assertion.</p>
<p>I should know, because <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1695712/">I discovered the SRY gene</a> on the human Y chromosome in 1990. For 35 years <a href="https://www.mcri.edu.au/news-stories/twenty-five-years-since-the-discovery-of-the-human-sex-determining-gene">I have been researching it</a> and other genes required for testis development.</p>
<h2>A brief primer on testes and ovary development</h2>
<p>If a human embryo has XY chromosomes, then at six weeks of development the SRY gene on the Y chromosome triggers a cascade of events involving some 30 different genes that lead to the formation of testes.</p>
<p>In simplest terms, the testes then produce hormones including testosterone, leading to male development.</p>
<p>However, if an embryo has XX chromosomes, a whole different group of genes come into play, ovaries form and the hormones produced result in a female.</p>
<p>We know making testes or ovaries requires a complex network of many interacting genes and proteins.</p>
<p>Some genes promote testis development while others promote ovary development.</p>
<p>Other genes either suppress ovary formation or antagonise testis formation.</p>
<p>Even once ovaries or testes are fully formed, we require other genes to maintain them. These genes don’t always function as expected, affecting the development of these organs.</p>
<p>Changes or variants in the many genes that regulate the development of a testis or ovary can result in sex reversal or a non-functioning testis or ovary.</p>
<p>What do I mean by this?</p>
<p>If there is a change in the SRY gene so it does not function as usual, then a person can fail to develop testes and be biologically female. Yet they carry XY chromosomes and under the World Athletics tests they would be excluded from competition.</p>
<p>Other XY individuals may have a functioning SRY gene but are female – with breasts and female genitalia, for example – but have internal testes.</p>
<p>Importantly, the cells of these people are physically unable to respond to the testosterone produced by these testes. Yet, they would receive positive SRY tests and be excluded from competition.</p>
<p>At the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, eight of 3,387 women athletes had <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/may/06/drugs-sport-genes-athletics-women#:%7E:text=At%20the%201996%20Olympics%20in%20Atlanta%2C%20eight%20of%203%2C387%20female%20athletes%20were%20found%20to%20possess%20a%20Y%C2%A0chromosome.">positive test results for a Y chromosome</a>. Of these, seven were <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(05)67843-9/fulltext#:%7E:text=seven%20had%20androgen%20insensitivity">resistant to testosterone</a>.</p>
<h2>The SRY test isn’t cut-and-dried</h2>
<p>World Athletics asserts the SRY gene is a reliable proxy for determining biological sex. But biological sex is much more complex, with chromosomal, gonadal (testis/ovary), hormonal and secondary sex characteristics all playing a role.</p>
<p>Using SRY to establish biological sex is wrong because all it tells you is whether or not the gene is present.</p>
<p>It does not tell you how SRY is functioning, whether a testis has formed, whether testosterone is produced and, if so, whether it can be used by the body.</p>
<h2>Other problems with the SRY testing process</h2>
<p>World Athletics is recommending all women athletes take a <a href="https://worldathletics.org/news/press-releases/sry-gene-test-athletes-female-category">cheek swab or blood sample</a> to test for the presence of SRY.</p>
<p>Normally, the sample would be sent to a lab that would extract DNA and look for the presence of the SRY gene.</p>
<p>This may be easy enough in wealthy countries, but what is going to happen in poorer nations without these facilities?</p>
<p>It is worth noting these tests are sensitive. If a male lab technician conducts the test he can inadvertently contaminate it with a single skin cell and produce a false positive SRY result.</p>
<p>No guidance is given on how to conduct the test to reduce the risk of false results.</p>
<p>Nor does World Athletics recognise the impacts a positive test result would have on a person, which can be more profound than exclusion from sport alone.</p>
<p>There was no mention from World Athletics that appropriate <a href="https://www.thewomens.org.au/patients-visitors/clinics-and-services/fertility-genetics/genetic-counselling">genetic counselling</a> should be provided, which is considered necessary prior to genetic testing and challenging to access in many lower- and middle-income countries.</p>
<p>I, along with many other experts, persuaded the International Olympic Committee to <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(05)67843-9/fulltext#:%7E:text=The%20International%20Olympic%20Committee%27s%20Athletes%20Commission%20hence%20called%20for%20its%20discontinuation%2C%20which%20their%20Executive%20Board%20agreed%20to%20in%20June%2C%201999%2C%20in%20time%20for%20the%202000%20Sydney%20Summer%20Games.">drop the use of SRY for sex testing</a> for the 2000 Sydney Olympics.</p>
<p>It is therefore very surprising that, 25 years later, there is a misguided effort to bring this test back.</p>
<p>Given all the problems outlined above, the SRY gene should not be used to exclude women athletes from competition.</p>
