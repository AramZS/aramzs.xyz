<p>Workers under cover of night removed a rainbow crosswalk outside of the former Pulse nightclub in Orlando, one of the most significant sites in Florida for the LGBTQ community, apparently as part of state and federal transportation officials’ aim to wipe “political banners” from public roadways.</p>
<p>Florida officials who have targeted such crossings in other communities have not directly acknowledged responsibility for removing this one. But local leaders had no doubt about the perpetrators, even though the state’s campaign had previously been carried out through public exhortations and directives, not clandestine repaintings.</p>
<p>“The Florida Department of Transportation, in the middle of the night, ripped rainbow colors off of a city street,” said state Sen. Carlos Guillermo Smith, who visited the site Thursday morning.</p>
<p>Smith, the first openly gay Hispanic legislator in Florida, noted the rainbow was intended to be “a tribute to 49 mostly LGBTQ people of color who were murdered here in cold blood.”</p>
<p>FDOT didn’t return requests from the Orlando Sentinel for comment.</p>
<p>The governor’s office directed the Sentinel to a post on DeSantis’ X account, which was a response to a tweet about the Orlando crosswalk’s removal. DeSantis stated, “We will not allow our state roads to be commandeered for political purposes.”</p>

<p>Florida Department of Transportation in recent weeks, even as the state pushed other resistant communities to remove their rainbow colors. That had led to hope that its place in the developing Pulse memorial would allow it to remain.</p>
<p>“We did everything according to state law, everything was compliant,” said Sheehan, the city’s first openly gay elected official, who had just seen the rainbow crosswalk in place Wednesday. “FDOT never moves that quickly with anything.”</p>
<p>Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer confirmed in a statement that the state was responsible for the removal and the city was not notified in advance.</p>
<p>The rainbow was first installed at Esther Street in 2017 on the southern edge of the Pulse site, a year after 49 were killed and 53 were wounded there. The club was known as an LGBTQ haven.</p>

<p>But because the crosswalk is so close to Orange Avenue — a state road — the city doesn’t believe it has the authority to paint back the rainbow, officials said.</p>
<p>Dyer, in a statement, said the rainbow crosswalk was actually installed by FDOT in line with national safety standards.</p>
<p>“This callous action of hastily removing part of a memorial to what was at the time our nation’s largest mass shooting, without any supporting data, or discussion is a cruel political act,” he said. “This crosswalk not only enhanced safety and visibility for the large number of pedestrians visiting the memorial, it also served as a visual reminder of Orlando’s commitment to honor the 49 lives taken on June 12, 2016.”</p>
<p>“While the state works to erase the memory of the victims of the Pulse tragedy by painting over the crosswalk, our community’s commitment to honoring the 49, and completing the memorial, will never waver.”</p>
<p>The campaign against rainbow crosswalks got underway in July, when U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy sent a letter to governors announcing a “safety initiative” seeking consistent markings on roads, citing a high number of traffic fatalities. While he didn’t mention rainbows in his letter, he clearly stated his intentions in a corresponding X post.</p>
<p>“Taxpayers expect their dollars to fund safe streets, not rainbow crosswalks,” he posted. “Political banners have no place on public roads. I’m reminding recipients of @USDOT roadway funding that it’s limited to features advancing safety, and nothing else. It’s that simple.”</p>
<p>A day later, DeSantis’ transportation secretary, Jared Perdue, wrote that Florida wants to “keep our transportation facilities free &amp; clear of political ideologies.”</p>
<p>Orlando then received a separate memo from FDOT informing the city that surface markings on roads must “serve a functional, safety-related purpose” and that the department’s manual “explicitly prohibits the application of pavement or surface art on travel lanes, paved shoulders, intersections, crosswalks or sidewalks.”</p>
<p>It also stated that social, political and ideological messaging is banned from roads.</p>
<p>However, such markings could remain if the state granted permission. The Orlando Sentinel had emailed questions to FDOT on Tuesday about the crosswalk, including if it had granted the city an exception, but did not get a response.</p>
<p>City officials had sought more information from the state — but received no response prior to the overnight Pulse crosswalk removal.</p>
<p>Crosswalks across the city are artistically painted with designs featuring citrus slices, swans, and logos from the city’s famous Main Street Districts. So far the state has taken no action to remove those other designs. Smith said he drove across one painted with the SoDo District Main Street logo on the way to the Pulse site.</p>
<p>Smith added that the brightly colored walkway was also intended to help keep visitors to the memorial safe.</p>
<p>“I can’t believe that the DeSantis administration would insult the families and survivors of the Pulse tragedy in this way,” Smith said. “But I suppose I should not be surprised.”</p>
<p>Jorshua Hernández Carrión, 31, a Pulse survivor, said nobody from the state or city contacted him about the crosswalk’s removal or explained why it needed to be done. He learned about it from the news on Thursday.</p>
<p>“It is frustrating for us and the family members,” he said. “That crosswalk was part of the memorial.”</p>
<p>Hernández Carrión, who was shot in his left arm and stomach, wants the crosswalk to be repainted to memorialize the lives that were lost at Pulse.</p>
<p>Brandon Wolf, who barely escaped the Pulse gunman, said the art was more than a crosswalk. It served as a “show of solidarity” and a declaration that the community wouldn’t forget the tragedy, he said.</p>
<p>“The petty cowards who ordered this sneaky erasure should feel lucky that they didn’t have to watch their loved ones be gunned down — to pick flowers and caskets for their funerals — only for the state to come along and desecrate their memories,” said Wolf, 37, now the national press secretary at the Human Rights Campaign.</p>
<p>The removal of the Orlando crosswalk comes as Delray Beach and other South Florida cities have been entrenched in a battle with the state to keep their rainbow intersections and crosswalks.</p>
<p>A majority of Delray Beach’s council opted not to remove their intersection and instead wait for a Sept. 2 administrative hearing, when a judge may decide whether the state can force Delray to remove it. That rainbow was still intact as of Thursday.</p>
<p>Orlando never got that opportunity.</p>
<p>“To go to the source of it in the middle of the night and do what I think is tantamount to trespassing and remove the source of this, this is not about safety at all, this is a political message,” Delray Beach vice mayor Rob Long said. “That’s all it’s ever been.”</p>
<p>By Thursday afternoon in Orlando, some of the rainbow had returned, if only temporarily. A local resident, Dallas Perdew, came by with chalk to fill in the now-empty gaps with color.</p>
