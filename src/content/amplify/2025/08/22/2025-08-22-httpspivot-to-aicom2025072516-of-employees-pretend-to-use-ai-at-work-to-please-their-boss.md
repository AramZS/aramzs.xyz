<p>Tech recruiters Howdy surveyed 1,047 full-time professionals who say they use AI. 30% of survey subjects said they were managers. [<a href="https://www.howdy.com/blog/AI-fatigue-statistics"><i>Howdy</i></a>]</p>
<p>75% of subjects were expected to use AI at work. 22% felt pressured to use AI when it was not appropriate. So 16% of subjects just <i>say</i> they used the AI when they didn’t! People feel they would be putting their job at risk if they pushed back on AI directives.</p>
<p>A full one-third said that fixing the AI’s mistakes took as much time as not using the AI.</p>
<p>More positively, 72% felt <i>energised</i> by using AI in their workflow! Though this survey screened for people who were already using AI at work.</p>
<p>Howdy found that AI didn’t speed up a lot of people’s work — but the Register notes that two-thirds of employees just accept the AI’s output, right or wrong. [<a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/07/22/ai_anxiety_us_workers/"><i>Register</i></a>]</p>
<p>Others lied to their boss that they <i>didn’t</i> use AI. They worried they’d be seen as freeloaders. That’s a valid worry — if you’re visibly using AI at work, your coworkers really do think you’re an <a href="https://pivot-to-ai.com/2025/05/10/your-coworkers-hate-you-for-using-ai-at-work/">incompetent lazy arse</a>. AI users <i>expected</i> to be considered “lazier, more replaceable, less competent, and less diligent.” Wonder why. [<a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2426766122"><i>PNAS</i></a>]</p>
<p>The answer is: use AI when you’re told, don’t use it even when you’re told, fake using AI, don’t fake using AI, just push the AI answers through, and if they give you a metric, hammer it into the ground.</p>
<p>The use case for chatbots at work is: <a href="https://pivot-to-ai.com/2025/06/11/chatgpt-goes-down-and-fake-jobs-grind-to-a-halt-worldwide/">we pretend to work, and they pretend to pay us</a>.</p>
