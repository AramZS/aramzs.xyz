<p>Elon Musk infamously threw Donald Trump under the bus in June when he insisted that the president was “in the Epstein files,” a reference to the late sex offender <a href="https://gizmodo.com/elon-says-trump-is-in-the-epstein-files-as-their-relationship-publicly-implodes-2000611855">Jeffrey Epstein</a>. But a newly released interview with Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell might put the spotlight back on Musk when it comes to all things Epstein.</p>
<p>Maxwell, who’s in prison for sex trafficking a minor, was recently interviewed by Todd Blanche, the president’s former personal attorney and now a top official at the U.S. Department of Justice. Redacted transcripts of the interview, along with audio recordings, were published to the DOJ website on <a href="https://www.justice.gov/maxwell-interview">Friday</a>.</p>
<h2>Brin’s birthday bash</h2>
<p>Blanche asked Maxwell about several powerful people, according to the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/storage/audio-files/Interview%20Transcript/Interview%20Transcript%20-%20Maxwell%202025.07.25-cft%20(Redacted).pdf">transcripts</a>, including Elon Musk:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>TODD BLANCHE:</strong> Okay. So I want to just — we went through several individuals yesterday and I want to go through just a couple of more names and ask if you — if you know them. And if you do know them, how you know them. Do you know Elon Musk?<br/> <strong>GHISLAINE MAXWELL:</strong> I do.<br/> <strong>BLANCHE:</strong> And how did you meet Mr. Musk?<br/> <strong>MAXWELL:</strong> I met him in — I don’t remember the year, but it’s going to be in 2010, ’11, something like that, I think, if my memory serves. And I was at an event for Sergey Brin, the co-founder of Google. And Sergey had arranged for — it was for his birthday. And we were — or a bunch of us, I don’t even remember how many we were, but not many of us. Maybe — I don’t know. If I say 40, I could be wrong. If it was 30 or 50, I don’t remember. I’m sorry. Went to another friend’s island. Somebody called Mr. Pigozzi in the Caribbean and — not with Epstein, he was not there, to celebrate Sergey’s birthday. And we were there together for, I want to say, three or four days, something like that in my memory. And Mr. Musk was present for that.<br/> <strong>BLANCHE:</strong> And that was the first time you met him, as far as you know?<br/> <strong>MAXWELL:</strong> As far as I remember, yes.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Wall Street Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/finance/jeffrey-epstein-advised-sergey-brin-with-tax-shelter-353cad20">reported in 2023</a> that Epstein advised Sergey Brin on tax matters in 2007. But Musk and Brin have their own drama. In 2022, Musk denied having an affair with Brin’s then-wife <a href="https://gizmodo.com/elon-musk-sex-wife-google-tesla-spacex-wsj-sergey-brin-1849326134">Nicole Shanahan</a>, who would go on to become Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s running mate in the 2024 presidential campaign. Brin divested from all of Musk’s companies after the alleged tryst, according to the Wall Street Journal.</p>
<h2>The photograph</h2>
<p>Blanche then went on to ask Maxwell about Elon’s brother Kimbal, who was reportedly set up with a girlfriend by Epstein many years ago, according to a report from <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/jeffrey-epsteins-ex-girlfriend-dated-kimbal-musk-brother-of-tesla-founder-elon-musk-2020-1">Business Insider</a> in 2020.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>BLANCHE:</strong> Did you meet — did you know his brother, Mr. Musk’s brother?<br/> <strong>MAXWELL:</strong> I don’t know if I’ve ever met him. I know that he has a brother and I don’t think I met him.<br/> <strong>BLANCHE:</strong> Aside from that time in — around 2010, on the island in the Caribbean for a couple days, did you — have you seen — do you know Mr. Musk beyond that time?<br/> <strong>MAXWELL:</strong> We met at — I was at the Oscars and we met at the Oscars.<br/> <strong>BLANCHE:</strong> What year was that, earlier or later?<br/> <strong>MAXWELL:</strong> It was post that event, I believe.<br/> <strong>BLANCHE:</strong> And do you know whether Mr. Epstein knew Mr. Musk?<br/> <strong>MAXWELL:</strong> I believe they did. And the only reason I say that is not from my memory, but because I saw — I think I saw — my memory is that in discovery, they were communicating on email.<br/> <strong>BLANCHE:</strong> So you have no personal knowledge of that?<br/> <strong>MAXWELL:</strong> I have no —<br/> <strong>BLANCHE:</strong> It’s just what you’ve — what you’ve seen from the press or from discovery?<br/> <strong>MAXWELL:</strong> And I believe his brother as well, actually.<br/> <strong>BLANCHE:</strong> Excuse me?<br/> <strong>MAXWELL:</strong> Mr. Musk’s brother as well. But I don’t — my — like I said, my memory is not — it’s not as good as I would like it to be. And I just want to say that.</p></blockquote>
<p>Maxwell seems to be referring to a Vanity Fair Oscars party on March 2, 2014, where she and Musk were photographed together. Musk has previously suggested she photobombed him during that event.</p>
<p>Writing in a tweet from 2020, Musk <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1278940731516780544">insisted</a>, “Don’t know Ghislaine at all. She photobombed me once at a Vanity Fair party several years ago. Real question is why VF invited her in the first place.”</p>
<p>But the fact that Maxwell claims they met years earlier, in 2010 or 2011, seems to be new information, provided Maxwell is telling the truth. Prosecutors alleged that she perjured herself, but dropped those charges after she was convicted of sex trafficking.</p>
<h2>The President and that <em>other</em> birthday</h2>
<p>This new interview will obviously be highly scrutinized, given the number of people who are named. But it’s also important to keep in mind what kind of incentives are at play for Maxwell, Blanche, and Trump. Not only was Blanche Trump’s former attorney, but he was also pretty damn chummy with Maxwell’s attorney David Oscar Markus. Blanche appeared on <a href="https://youtu.be/7Kpdn0-IESo">Markus’s podcast</a> twice, according to ABC News.</p>
<p>Trump has been cagey when asked about Maxwell, even giving a bizarre answer to questions during his first term when she was first sent to prison. During a White House briefing in July 21, 2020, Trump said, “I haven’t really been following it too much. I just wish her well, frankly. I’ve met her numerous times over the years, especially since I lived in Palm Beach, and I guess they lived in Palm Beach, but I wish her well, whatever it is.”</p>

The letter included a line that the two men “have certain things in common,” and reportedly states that “enigmas never age,” ending with the line “Happy Birthday—and may every day be another wonderful secret.”</p>
<p>A photo of the letter hasn’t been made public, but fake versions of the letter have gone <a href="https://gizmodo.com/fake-trump-epstein-letters-spread-online-after-bombshell-report-2000631869">viral online</a>. Trump was friends with Epstein for at least 15 years before they had some kind of falling out. Trump defenders insist it was because Epstein was being a “creep” at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club, while others believe it had more to do with a real estate deal where the men were competing to buy a property.</p>
<p>It’s extremely unusual for a high-ranking official at the DOJ to personally interview someone in prison. But these are extremely unusual times.</p>
