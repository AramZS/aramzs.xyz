<p>For a while, Annie Knight was making good money on OnlyFans. Actually, it was <em>really</em> good money — as in, $30,000 AUD per month — but it wasn’t enough to allow the 28-year-old to retire young or buy up the amount of properties required to have a hefty passive income in Gold Coast, Australia. “I was like, ‘What am I gonna do to get people’s attention?’” she says. “People can go on Pornhub and watch a girl that looks like me, but what’s gonna make them want to subscribe and get to know me?”</p>
<p>The answer, as it so often is when you’re trying to get attention on the internet, was to piss people off. In 2023, Knight started telling stories about her sex life on her Instagram and TikTok — tales of pegging, threesomes, and having sex with 300 people in a year. “People were shocked, they were outraged,” she recalls. A local radio show had her on and referred to her as “Australia’s most sexually active woman” (the original plan was to call her “Australia’s biggest slut,” which she says she was fine with, but they softened the language). The more the media ran with it, the more her subscriber count grew. Soon enough, she’d more than tripled her monthly earnings to around $100,000 AUD.</p>
<p>“I was like, ‘All right, let’s see if I can do 600 in a year,’” says Knight. In 2024, she achieved the goal. Then people asked when she’d do 1,000. But the thing about sleeping with so many people in a year is that only so much of your audience is going to care, even as the number rises. “Once you’ve done 600 in a year, do people really care if you’ve done a thousand? Even when I said I was going to take 500 virginities in a year, still people were like, ‘Eh, whatever.’”</p>
<p>By that point, halfway across the world, two British creators had made even bigger headlines with their “extreme” sex challenges: Lily Phillips, 23, who filmed herself sleeping with 100 men last October, and Bonnie Blue, 26, real name Tia Billinger, who in January claimed to have had intercourse with 1,057 men in 12 hours. In May, inspired by Blue and Phillips, Knight held her own single-day challenge by sleeping with 583 men in just six hours. That month, her earnings were $600,000 AUD, or nearly $400,000.</p>
<p>In the near-decade since the arrival of OnlyFans in 2016, <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/22749123/onlyfans-influencers-sex-work-instagram-pornography">the line between influencer and sex worker has blurred</a>, with those who fall more on the influencer end of the spectrum pocketing most of the profits. Content that’s sexy and nothing else doesn’t cut it anymore — and it’s far more difficult for those performers to earn a living wage. Kylie Rae Hall, a creator and founder of the OnlyFans agency Playroom, says that in the platform’s boom times in the early pandemic, creators could make tens of thousands of dollars a month simply by directing their Instagram followers to the links in their bio. Due to market oversaturation and the prevalence of leaks and scams in the years since, the typical model who might take a single photo shoot a month and delegate the labor of posting, promotion, and DM-ing with subscribers to a management company has likely seen around a 70 percent earnings loss, she estimates. “The girls that are making the most money are the ones making TikToks every day, constantly putting themselves out there to differentiate themselves from your everyday influencer.”</p>
<p>Alongside the predictable backlash that comes with it, these stunts have made Phillips, Blue, and Knight some of the most talked-about influencers in the world. They didn’t invent the concept of the gangbang, nor “extreme” sex challenges (<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/12/lily-phillips-outrage-porn-100-men/681032/">several performers in the ’90s filmed</a> themselves having sex with hundreds of men in a day), but it differs from typical porn in that the headline-grabbing stunts essentially act as marketing for their subscription pages. On OnlyFans, if people don’t care about you as a person, they won’t care about your content. “It’s not porn, because porn is free. You can go on many different sites and type in exactly what your kink or interests are and find that without paying,” explains Andrew Bachman, CEO of the OnlyFans talent agency Creators, Inc. “This is really about a boredom void. It’s about being on Instagram and having something presented to you in a certain way and you then go down a rabbit hole,” he says of the parasocial relationships subscribers form with their favorite creators. “There’s just a market for brain rot.”</p>
<p>Part of what makes Blue, Phillips, and Knight stand out is the juxtaposition between their <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2021/11/tiktok-clean-look-beauty-trend.html">“clean girl”</a> aesthetic and the content they post — if you didn’t follow the links in their bios that direct to their OnlyFans pages, you might not know they had them at all. Watching three women who wouldn’t look out of place next to a parade of blonde <a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/nyc-west-village-neighborhood-new-generation-women-girls.html">West Village</a> PR managers have sex with hundreds of men in a day offers an irresistible fantasy: What if the cute influencer making “get ready with me”s and trendy TikTok dances were actually DTF? In <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DJ3i5iMTm9u/">Knight’s Instagram vlog</a> of the 583 challenge, she starts her day off in a cute two-piece and a walk with her doodle before arriving on set in a long red robe. It isn’t until we see a pile of Annie Knight–branded condoms and a line of men in pink balaclavas that anything looks different from a typical “day in my life” video. “I’ve just been railed by 106 guys, so my arms are a little bit sore,” she says later, clutching a Powerade. As she drives home, Taylor Swift’s “Long Live” blares on the radio. “That was the best day ever!” she says. “I’m literally beyond ecstatic that that many guys showed up.”</p>
<p>Knight’s challenge took around six weeks to plan, requiring the help of five personal assistants, a videographer, a photographer, and three hired security guards who searched the men and handed them condoms and balaclavas to protect their anonymity. Though many OnlyFans shoots and porn videos film in short-term rental properties, as was the case with Phillips’s video, Knight was worried she could lose her Airbnb account if she filmed there, so the stunt was filmed at a swinger’s club in the Gold Coast. She’d posted a call on Instagram “for basically anyone to come and rail me if they wanted to,” adding that she’d expected just 200, but 583 turned up. The hardest part of all of it, she says, was having to act as her own fluffer when the woman they’d originally hired to keep the men’s penises erect didn’t show.</p>
<p>Knight speaks about the experience with delight, even after an existing medical condition flared up and caused bleeding and pain, landing her in the hospital two days later. She maintains she’s STI negative (people ask her this constantly, she says) and that she genuinely wants to be doing what she’s doing. “They’re acting like I’m being forced into this,” she says. “I’m a woman who gets to choose what she does with her body, and I’m choosing to do this. If at any point I felt uncomfortable, I would have stopped.” Hall, the Playroom founder, agrees: “I always laugh when I see comments like that, like, ‘You’re setting women back’ … I think men are scared of it,” she says. “It’s the first time our generation has seen women in sex work have full power over what they post and make the full profit themselves.” As Blue <a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/uk/love-sex/sex/a64588416/bonnie-blue-lily-phillips-interview/">told <em>Cosmopolitan</em> U.K. in April</a>, part of the reason people get so irritated with her is that she, as an attractive woman from a supportive middle-class family, doesn’t “need” to be doing porn. “It goes against everything they’ve ever tried to say about women who do sex work. There’s no [traumatic] background; no one’s forcing me to do it; I’m not in a difficult position financially — it’s as simple as I enjoy sex.”</p>
<p>Phillips has a similar perspective. “It’s so fun to do this job because I’ve experienced some of my kinks that I don’t think I would have ever experienced off-camera,” she says on Zoom from her home in London. She explains that the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFySAh0g-MI">viral YouTube documentary</a> from December about her 100-men stunt told only part of the story, specifically the scene in which she cries at the end of the 14-hour session. Commenters referred to her as traumatized and “broken” and the stunt as “self-harm” while <a href="https://www.deseret.com/opinion/2025/01/03/gisele-pelicot-trial-lily-phillips-onlyfans/">media outlets</a> <a href="https://www.glamourmagazine.co.uk/article/bonnie-blue-lily-phillips-sex-shaming">compared</a> the men lining up to have sex with her to those who raped Gisèle Pelicot. “People thought I was really regretful, and that’s definitely not what I was saying,” she explains. “I was exhausted. It was just a very intense day.” She says the stunt ended up netting her a 70 to 80 percent bump in subscriptions revenue.</p>
<p>The rise of “extreme” sex challenges has drawn the wrath of a few unlikely philosophical bedfellows: the right-wing, manosphere-adjacent cohort who believe women’s sexual liberation has gone too far, and feminists who believe their stunts are setting the movement back or that the performers are victims of patriarchy. “Ms. Phillips’s case is one example of how normalization of pornographic extremes has made even lurid acts de rigueur; it’s not hard to imagine a future that asks (and offers) more than we can imagine today,” wrote author Christine Emba in a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/19/opinion/pornography-harm-society.html">New York <em>Times</em> Opinion piece</a> last month. Even other OnlyFans models have spoken out against sex challenges. When Blue, who couldn’t be reached for comment, announced earlier this month that she planned to organize a “petting zoo” in which she’d be tied up naked in a glass box inside a house in London and allow the public to do whatever they liked with her, OnlyFans creator Sophie Rain <a href="https://x.com/sophieraiin/status/1932540900749758841">called her out on X</a>. “They’re turning it into a circus,” Rain said via email. “A platform that once empowered women to take control of their bodies and their business is now being overshadowed by extreme, performative stunts.”</p>
<p>What of the men who sign up to take part in them? A 34-year-old Redditor from Norway with the username Chicken_Of_The_Year told me he applied to Phillips’s “1,000 men in a day” challenge (which has yet to take place), because he’d always dreamed of having sex with a porn star. The online questionnaire asked him for his nationality, height, and weight, a photo, and whether he used Viagra or any other substances to stay hard. “I lived in a sexless marriage for eight years and watched porn daily since I was 14,” he said. “Being part of something like this felt like a once-in-a-lifetime chance to connect with a real porn star.”</p>
<p>The petting zoo, originally scheduled for June 15, never happened. After a public outcry, OnlyFans confirmed that it had permanently banned Blue’s account, writing in a statement that “extreme ‘challenge’ content is not available on OnlyFans” and that its creators are not allowed to host challenges on the platform. This puts other challenge creators in a vulnerable spot. Knight, who published her challenge content on the platform Fansly, says that on a recent call with OnlyFans, the site warned her that even posting such videos on other platforms could risk her losing her account. Though she’ll continue doing long-term challenges like sleeping with 500 virgins in a year, she says that she won’t do another single-day stunt. Phillips, meanwhile, says she’s in “open conversation” with OnlyFans and still hopes to break the world record for the most men in a single day. She’d originally planned to film it in the U.S. in January but was stopped by Border Patrol on her way into the country, where they told her that because she’d be filming and monetizing the content, it constituted sex work. (In the U.K. and Australia, certain forms of sex work are legal, unlike in the U.S.)</p>
<p>Platforms like OnlyFans and the creators who run accounts there are at constant risk from payment providers and banks deciding they no longer want to be associated with a site known for sex work. In 2021, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/27/22641095/onlyfans-sex-work-ban-online-porn-payment-processing-controversy">OnlyFans briefly announced</a>, then reneged, that it would ban all explicit sexual content over conflicts with payment providers, notably Mastercard and Visa, which previously had cut off payments to Pornhub after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/04/opinion/sunday/pornhub-rape-trafficking.html">an exposé in the <em>Times</em></a> on nonconsensual and underage porn. Creators can turn to other platforms or launch their own, of course, but as Bachman, the Creators, Inc., CEO, explains, “What OnlyFans did was win mainstream consumers’ comfort of knowing what it was.” More than 200 million users trust the platform enough to input their credit cards. He expects that if someone like Blue, whose reported income was almost <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/35331520/bonnie-blue-onlyfans-ban-pay-cut/">$10 million per year</a>, were to pivot to an alternative, “She might make 15 percent of the revenue she was making if she’s lucky.”</p>
<p>This world is competitive: OnlyFans models have turned to inventive marketing methods like buying up <a href="https://www.usermag.co/p/onlyfans-billboards-are-taking-over">billboard space</a> across the country to promote their accounts or going on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/whatever/?hl=en">rage-bait podcasts</a> in the hopes that a clip featuring their face might go viral. They engage in <a href="https://x.com/nataliegwinters/status/1866918854091477364?s=46">debates with anti-porn conservatives</a> engineered to generate angry comments because at least some percentage of those viewers will find them intriguing enough to pay to see them naked or exchange DMs. Blue and Phillips, who once made Freshers’ Week content together in which they filmed themselves having sex with new university co-eds, have seemed to be in a monthslong, mostly one-sided feud over Phillips <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/33490684/bonnie-blue-lily-phillips-friendship-feud/">allegedly stealing</a> (according to Blue) Blue’s idea to sleep with 1,000 men in a day (Phillips <a href="https://thetab.com/2025/05/22/every-savage-and-nice-thing-bonnie-blue-and-lily-phillips-have-ever-said-about-each-other#:~:text=Lily%20said%20there's%20no%20rivalry,to%20go%20around%20for%20everyone!%E2%80%9D">has congratulated</a> her stunt and said there’s no competition between them). The higher the number, the more unbelievable the stunts become, and the more the clips feel less like porn and more like watching a MrBeast video in which the prize money keeps climbing. Like on YouTube, there is a sense of unreality to their work: Blatant hoaxes are tolerated, even celebrated, if they succeed in generating enough attention. In February, Phillips announced she was pregnant on Instagram shortly after Blue <a href="https://thetab.com/2025/02/21/bonnie-blue-reveals-the-real-reason-behind-her-rumoured-pregnancy-and-its-actually-kinda-nice">hinted at</a> her own possible pregnancy; the story was <a href="https://people.com/onlyfans-star-lily-phillips-pregnant-with-first-baby-11683069">picked up by <em>People</em></a>. It was a lie, part of a fetish role-play scenario she’d filmed — but not before commenters called her “disgusting” and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2025/02/21/lily-phillips-admitted-faking-a-pregnancy-feel-sick-22604688/">tabloids</a> called her <a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/20/lifestyle/porn-star-lily-philips-who-cried-after-sleeping-with-100-men-admits-her-pregnancy-is-fake-just-out-for-your-attention/">“sick.”</a> Smiling, Phillips says, “It went down super well.”</p>
<p>As for Blue, she seems committed to working the rage-bait circuit. Since being banned from OnlyFans, Blue has filmed a two-and-a-half-hour episode of the <em>Disruptors</em> podcast with Andrew Tate, most of which is devoted to Tate bloviating simultaneously that Blue is the tragic endpoint of western feminism and also that all women throughout history have been sex workers. Toward the end of the episode, Blue defends her content and her marketing prowess. “Multiple other creators do what I do, but they don’t get banned, because they don’t have enough brain cells to promote themselves like I do,” she says. “I’m not the only person that’s claimed to have done what I’ve done, yet you don’t see them in the press.”</p>
<p>Sex workers have always been the internet’s true pioneers, and they have always borne the brunt of its backlashes. When there’s life-changing money and attention at stake, there are worse things to be besides the mascot for “feminism having gone too far.” Phillips is the millionaire head of a 15-person team. She spends her days walking her dog, grabbing matcha, filming, editing, doing admin work, and catching up on <em>Love Island</em>. When she goes out, the young men who approach her are generally “really nice.” She hopes to someday move to Los Angeles, where all the major porn studios and stars reside. “I have so much respect for anyone who does [challenge content] because it is so hard to put together,” she says. “And I’m not just talking about the hours of fucking. I mean the organization behind it.”</p>
<p>To Phillips, it’s not just about the art of the troll. But the outcry so far has seemed to work in her favor. “There’s always been this type of rage-bait content,” she says. “It is just the oldest trick in the book to be a bit cheeky, and people will look.”</p>
