<p>Scottish actress Michelle Gomez, best known for playing Missy in <em>Doctor Who</em>, has responded to backlash after she was cast in new audiobook series <em>Harry Potter: The Full-Cast Audio Editions</em>.</p>
<p>Gomez is <a href="https://www.thepinknews.com/2025/08/06/rupauls-drag-race-uk-star-slams-guest-judge-harry-potter-audio-series/">set to voice</a> the role of Professor McGonagall in the audio series, which is helmed by Audible and Pottermore Publishing, the latter of which is owned by <em><a href="https://www.thepinknews.com/topic/harry-potter/">Harry Potter</a></em> author JK Rowling.</p>
<p>JK Rowling has faced a great deal of controversy over the last five years for <a href="https://www.thepinknews.com/2025/04/11/what-has-jk-rowling-said-about-transgender-people-trans-views-tweets/">her outspoken, ‘gender-critical’ views</a> about transgender people. As such, actors involved in upcoming <em>Harry Potter</em> projects are frequently criticised by the LGBTQ+ community.</p>
<p>After the cast of the audiobook series was revealed, such a backlash did hit Gomez, with many on social media describing her involvement as “disappointing”.</p>

<p>The actress has now addressed the criticism in a statement on her Instagram Stories account, in which she stated that she stands with trans people “fully and without hesitation”.</p>
<p>“To my LGBTQ+ fans, and especially the trans community: I want to speak directly to the concerns that have been raised about my involvement in this project,” she began.</p>
<p>“I hear you, and I understand why this is painful for many. I want to be clear that I stand with trans people, and I support trans rights – fully and without hesitation.</p>
<p>“When I accepted this role, I did so as someone who has always loved the stories and what they meant to so many – especially those who found comfort and identity in that world,” she wrote.</p>
<p>“I now understand more clearly how deeply complicated and hurtful this association can feel, and I take that seriously. Being an ally means listening even when it’s uncomfortable and taking accountability where it’s needed. I’m committed to doing both.”</p>

<p>Though Gomez stopped short of apologising for accepting the role, she shared that she had made a donation to <a href="https://callen-lorde.org/about/">Callen-Lorde</a>, an LGBTQ+ health organisation in New York.</p>
<p><em>Harry Potter: The Full-Cast Audio Editions </em>will also feature <em>House</em> star Hugh Laurie as Albus Dumbledore, <em>Succession’s</em> Matthew Macfadyen as Lord Voldemort, and <em>Sound of Metal </em>actor Riz Amed as Professor Snape.</p>
<p><em>Torchwood</em> star Cush Jumbo will appear as the audiobook narrator; she was <a href="https://www.thepinknews.com/2025/08/06/rupauls-drag-race-uk-star-slams-guest-judge-harry-potter-audio-series/">criticised by <em>Drag Race UK</em> contestant Kate Butch</a> over her involvement in the project, as Jumbo had appeared as a guest judge on the LGBTQ+ show back in 2023.</p>

<p>None of the other actors involved in the audiobook project have responded to the backlash.</p>
<p>Those involved in the audiobook – and in HBO’s upcoming <em>Harry Potter</em> reboot – have faced criticism by those who believe that by taking part in a <em>Potter </em>project, actors are <a href="https://www.thepinknews.com/2025/05/26/jk-rowling-womens-fund-amelia-hansford-op-ed/">helping to financially support JK Rowling</a>.</p>
<p>JK Rowling recently revealed that she had <a href="https://www.thepinknews.com/2024/02/19/jk-rowling-for-women-scotland-donation-legal-definition-woman/">donated a sum of money</a> to support the legal battle which preceded the UK’s Supreme Court ruling that trans women are excluded from the legal definition of “women” under the 2010 Equality Act.</p>
<p>The writer also revealed that she had <a href="https://www.thepinknews.com/2025/05/26/jk-rowling-womens-fund-explainer/">set up the JK Rowling Women’s Fund</a> to support similar legal cases.</p>
