title: ChatGPT 5 is even more of a bastard than 4
---
<p>First review of ChatGPT 5. It's even more stupid and asshole-like than the previous version. It is remarkable how it pretends it knows what it's doing, and then you do something it said would work with what they can now do, but then after you take about 15 minutes to set up your end it turns out nothing changed, it still can't do it.</p>
<p>I am being more careful about what problems I give to ChatGPT and taking my own advice to use it as a fantastic search engine, but don't rely on its advice on how to approach problems unless you're sure that's what you want, and don't believe anything it says that isn't straight factual and sometimes, it not only gets it wrong, but it lies and gaslights.</p>
<p>The big lie is that they want you to believe this is human. This is a carnival stand imitation of a human. It may be that it's getting worse, or it's always been this way and I'm seeing more clearly. It was and is still a miracle, but nothing like what was in the science fiction books.</p>
