<p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker has <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" data-ylk="slk:signed a bill into law;cpos:1;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://idfpr.illinois.gov/content/dam/soi/en/web/idfpr/news/2025/2025-08-04-idfpr-press-release-hb1806.pdf">signed a bill into law</a> banning AI therapy in the state. This makes Illinois the first state to regulate the use of AI in mental health services. The law highlights that only licensed professionals are allowed to offer counseling services in the state and forbids AI chatbots or tools from acting as a stand-alone therapist.</p>
<p><a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" data-ylk="slk:HB 1806;cpos:2;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://www.ilga.gov/documents/legislation/104/HB/PDF/10400HB1806lv.pdf">HB 1806</a>, titled the Wellness and Oversight for Psychological Resources Act, also specifies that licensed therapists cannot use AI to make “therapeutic decisions” or perform any “therapeutic communication.” It also places constraints on how mental health professionals may use AI in their work, such as specifying that its use for “supplementary support,” such as managing appointments, billing or other administrative work, is allowed.</p>
<p>In a statement to <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" data-ylk="slk:Mashable;cpos:3;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://mashable.com/article/illinois-bill-banning-ai-therapy-signed-by-pritzker"><em>Mashable</em></a>, Illinois State Representative Bob Morgan said, “We have already heard the horror stories when artificial intelligence pretends to be a licensed therapist. Individuals in crisis unknowingly turned to AI for help and were pushed toward dangerous, even lethal, behaviors.” The law enshrines steep penalties in an effort to curb such outcomes, with companies or individuals facing $10,000 in fines per violation.</p>
<p>“This legislation stands as our commitment to safeguarding the well-being of our residents by ensuring that mental health services are delivered by trained experts who prioritize patient care above all else,” <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" data-ylk="slk:said;cpos:4;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://idfpr.illinois.gov/news/2025/gov-pritzker-signs-state-leg-prohibiting-ai-therapy-in-il.html">said</a> Mario Treto Jr., secretary of the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation.</p>
<p>The bill passed the Illinois House and Senate <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" data-ylk="slk:unanimously;cpos:5;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://www.ilga.gov/Legislation/BillStatus/VoteHistory?GAID=18&amp;DocNum=1806&amp;DocTypeID=HB&amp;LegId=159219&amp;SessionID=114">unanimously</a> in a sign of overwhelming bipartisan support. The legislation is particularly notable as the <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" data-ylk="slk:Trump administration’s recently-revealed AI plan;cpos:6;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/everyones-a-loser-in-trumps-ai-action-plan-160023247.html">Trump administration’s recently-revealed AI plan</a> outlines a 10-year moratorium on any state-level AI regulation.
