<p>I recently moved to a new apartment, and unfortunately, the television didn’t make the cut during the amicable roommate split. While my studio isn’t as cramped as my previous living situations, fitting a bulky TV into the living area still felt impractical to me.</p>
<p>In my search for a suitable alternative, a startup called Lumi Labs reached out about testing its new portable projector, the <a href="https://grablumi.com/">Lumi Max</a>. From the moment I unboxed it, I was impressed by how far projectors have come since my college days, when I struggled with a dingy one passed down from a friend that projected grainy video onto my dorm wall.</p>
<p>One of the things I appreciate about the Lumi Max is its compact design. It stands vertically, making it perfect for small spaces; it can easily rest on a shelf or be tucked away when not in use. Weighing in at just over 4 pounds, it’s noticeably lighter than many other projectors on the market. The founders are avid camping enthusiasts, so it’s designed to fit snugly in backpacks, making it convenient to travel and set up in outdoor settings. Plus, it comes with a carrying case.</p>
<p>The standout feature of the Lumi Max, which became available earlier this month, is its partnership with Google. The projector runs on Google TV by default, providing access to over 10,000 apps, more than 700,000 movies and TV shows, and over 800 free live TV channels out of the box. Setting it up is simple if you already have a Google account, and it includes a remote for easy navigation.</p>
<p>Beyond the built-in Google TV, other features caught my attention, like the autofocus and obstacle avoidance features. The Lumi Max can recognize objects on the wall — such as picture frames, plants, or shelves — and automatically adjust the image placement. Since I haven’t put any art on my walls yet, I had a blank canvas to work with. However, it did alert me when my chair was in the way, allowing me to easily reposition it for the best viewing experience.</p>
<p>The display size is also impressive: 40 to 120 inches, and it’s coupled with 1080p full HD resolution and 4K UHD compatibility.</p>
<p>Another pleasant surprise was the sound quality. The Lumi Max features two 5W speakers (delivering a total audio output of 10W), and there’s also Dolby Audio support, so you can hook it up to an external sound system for enhanced audio performance.</p>

<p>The price tag comes in around $400, which is quite reasonable considering the array of features it provides, especially when compared to what I would normally spend on a decent-quality television.</p>
<p>Lumi Labs also sells adjustable projector stands for $30 and 100-inch projector screens for $20 on its website. The company is also set to launch a “Lumi IQ” mobile app that features an AI assistant, allowing users to control the projector with their voice.</p>
