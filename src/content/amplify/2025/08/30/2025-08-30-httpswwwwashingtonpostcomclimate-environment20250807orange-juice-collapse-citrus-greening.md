<p>Orange juice was once a symbol of health and the United States’ booming agriculture. In the 1950s, advertisements sponsored by the Florida Citrus Commission encouraged Americans to drink “a full big glass” of orange juice every day to ward off colds and boost their levels of vitamin C. Orange juice, consumers were told, could prevent a troubling condition called acidosis; at peak, three-quarters of American households kept the drink in their refrigerators.</p>
