title: What's Left for Frontend Engineers?

<p>I went back to Bozeman!</p>

<p>Building webservices with HTML APIs (aka MVC, aka <a href="https://unplannedobsolescence.com/blog/the-server-doesnt-render/">server-side rendering</a>, aka “rails-style”) is gaining traction again, thanks to improvements in web standards and lightweight <a href="https://unplannedobsolescence.com/blog/behavior-belongs-in-html/">HTML-driven</a> libraries like <a href="https://htmx.org">htmx</a>. Although there will occasionally be reasons to go beyond what the platform provides, this will always be <a href="https://unplannedobsolescence.com/blog/hard-page-load/">the architecture that best aligns with the core competencies of the web</a>, and the platform is improving every day.</p>
<p>But if the backend engineers are writing HTML, what’s left for the frontend engineers? I propose a basic set of responsibilities for the browser specialists on the team.</p>
<ol> <li><strong>Setup the infrastucture</strong> - know how a template engine works, get it installed, and set up the basic page structure</li> <li><strong>Extend HTML</strong> - write new <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components/Using_custom_elements">custom elements</a> that add <a href="https://htmx.org/essays/webcomponents-work-great/">declarative capabilities to your templates</a></li> <li><strong>Be the browser expert</strong> - own the more complicated frontend problems—like security and accessibility—and be up to date on the most future-proof ways to handle them</li> </ol>
<p>And if you run out of things to do? Well, your backend colleagues are full-stack now—no reason you can’t be too.</p>
<p>A number of Big Sky Dev Con ’25 talks touched on similar ideas (hypermedia-mentum?), and if you enjoy this one, I recommend also checking out these others:</p>
