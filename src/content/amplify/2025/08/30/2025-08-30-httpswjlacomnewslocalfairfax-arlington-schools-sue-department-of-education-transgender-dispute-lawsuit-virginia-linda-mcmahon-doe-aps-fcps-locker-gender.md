<p>WASHINGTON, D.C. (7News) — Fairfax County Public Schools (FCPS) &amp; Arlington Public Schools (APS) announced they're suing the U.S. Department of Education (DOE) because the DOE has begun the process of freezing federal funding to the school districts.</p>
<p>In July, the DOE announced FCPS, APS, Loudoun County Public Schools, Prince William County Public Schools and Alexandria City Public Schools have policies that allow students the option to use bathrooms and locker rooms at school based on their gender identity, not biological sex, and that those policies violate Title IX. In an interview with 7News in July, the U.S. Secretary of Education said that if the school systems don’t end their bathroom and locker room policies, they would risk losing federal funding.</p>
<p>The DOE gave the five Northern Virginia School Districts time to reverse their policies.</p>
<p>However, two weeks ago, the five school districts all said they would keep their policies because the districts believe their policies follow a judge’s order and the law. After that, the DOE announced it was beginning the process of terminating funds to the five school systems.</p>
<p>Fairfax County Superintendent Michelle Reid said DOE has attempted to designate FCPS as a high-risk entity, effectively freezing access to as much as $167 million in federal funding.</p>
<p>“This lawsuit is an important step in our effort to protect the health and safety of all our students in alignment with state and federal law — to ensure that hungry children are fed and that student access to multilingual, special education, and other essential services is not compromised,” the Fairfax County School Board announced in a letter to FCPS staff and families. “FCPS remains dedicated to creating a safe, supportive, and inclusive school environment for all students and staff members, including our transgender and gender-expansive community. We have a responsibility to ensure that every child has the support needed to achieve their full, unique, and limitless potential. We will not abide attempts to pit one group of students against another."</p>

<p>APS said they filed a complaint in federal court and moved for an injunction seeking to reverse the DOE’s designation of APS as a high risk grantee. APS explains under a “high risk” classification, APS has been effectively relieved of approximately $23 million in federal funding, “jeopardizing programs that support academics, counseling, and free and reduced meals for over 8,000 students.”</p>
<p>“APS has a duty to our community of students, families and educators to defend the resources they deserve, and policies designed to protect students of all backgrounds. Students are punished when federal funding, primarily used to provide free breakfast and lunch for over 8,000 students or counseling and education for special needs students, is ripped away,” said Dr. Francisco Durán, Superintendent, Arlington Public Schools. “We strongly disagree with the U.S. DOE’s assertion that our policy violates Title IX. Current APS policy adheres to state and federal law. The U.S. DOE is demanding we violate those laws and, in our view, following the law is not optional. We will continue to uphold and advocate for policies that reflect our values and support the academic and social-emotional well-being of every child.”</p>

<p>In July, 7News Reporter Nick Minock sat down with the U.S. Secretary of Education in a one-on-one interview.</p>
<p>“And it's just also making girls feel vulnerable,” McMahon said. “They don't want to sit there and have boys watch them undress, or to have boys undress in front of them. And these are high schools that we're talking about. So these are really young men and women in these locker rooms. And so we feel that they have to change that policy.”</p>
<p>On Aug. 15, the Education Department told 7News it would <a href="https://wjla.com/news/local/virginia-school-districts-defend-transgender-bathroom-locker-room-policies-alexandria-city-prince-william-county-arlington-loudoun-county-department-of-education-title-ix">begin suspending or completely cutting off federal financial assistance to the five Virginia school districts</a>.</p>
<p>"The Virginia divisions will have to defend their embrace of radical gender ideology over ensuring the safety of their students," a portion of the department's statement read.</p>
