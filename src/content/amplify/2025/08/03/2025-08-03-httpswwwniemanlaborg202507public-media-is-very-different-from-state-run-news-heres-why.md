<p>In many ways, public media remains the last broadly shared civic commons.</p>

<p>Champions of the almost entirely <a href="https://www.poynter.org/business-work/2025/senate-cuts-funding-rescission-package-npr-pbs-cpb/">party-line vote</a> in the U.S. Senate to <a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2025/07/public-media-appeals-to-audiences-for-support-after-rescission-bill-passes/">erase $1.1 billion in already approved funds</a> for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting called their action a refusal to subsidize liberal media.</p>
<p>“Public broadcasting has long been overtaken by partisan activists,” <a href="https://www.wgbh.org/news/2025-07-17/house-nears-vote-on-cuts-to-npr-pbs-and-foreign-aid-programs">said U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz</a> of Texas, insisting there is no need for government to fund what he regards as biased media. “If you want to watch the left-wing propaganda, turn on MSNBC,” Cruz said.</p>
<p>Accusing the media of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/17541320802457111">liberal bias</a> has been a consistent conservative complaint since the civil rights era, when white Southerners insisted news outlets were slanting their stories against segregation. During his presidential campaign in 1964, U.S. Sen. Barry Goldwater of Arizona complained that the media was against him, an accusation that has been repeated by <a href="https://www.cjr.org/first_person/republicans-media.php">every Republican presidential candidate since</a>.</p>
<p>But those charges of bias rarely survive empirical scrutiny.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.boisestate.edu/sps-frankchurchinstitute/sam-martin/">chair of a public policy institute</a> devoted to strengthening deliberative democracy, I have written <a href="https://www.tamupress.com/book/9781623495626/columns-to-characters/">two books</a> <a href="https://www.uapress.ua.edu/9780817320843/decoding-the-digital-church/">about the media and the presidency</a>, and <a href="https://www.routledge.com/Visual-Ethics-A-Guide-for-Photographers-Journalists-and-Media-Makers/Lester-Martin-Smith-Rodden/p/book/9781032151908?srsltid=AfmBOooAUmSmU0cyjYZv2CrXz7jKWya9cu_Q_XjZKu8kmy_6BcJDse1T">another about media ethics</a>. My research traces how news institutions shape civic life and why healthy democracies rely on journalism that is independent of both market pressure and partisan talking points.</p>
<p>That independence in the United States — enshrined in <a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-1/">the press freedom clause of the First Amendment</a> — gives journalists the ability to hold government accountable, expose abuses of power and thereby support democracy.</p>
<h3>Trusting independence</h3>
<p>Ad Fontes Media, a self-described “public benefit company” whose mission is to rate media for credibility and bias, have placed the reporting of PBS NewsHour under 10 points left of the ideological center. They label it as both “reliable” and based in “analysis/fact.” Fox and Friends, by contrast, the popular morning show on Fox News, is nearly 20 points to the right. The scale starts at zero and runs 42 points to the left to measure progressive bias and 42 points to the right to measure conservative bias. Ratings are provided by three-person <a href="https://adfontesmedia.com/pbs-bias-and-reliability/">panels comprising left-, right- and center-leaning reviewers</a>.</p>
<p>A 2020 <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aay9344">peer-reviewed study in Science Advances</a> that tracked more than 6,000 political reporters likewise found “no evidence of liberal media bias” in the stories they chose to cover, even though <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2004/05/23/iv-values-and-the-press/">most journalists are more left-leaning</a> than the rest of the population.</p>
<p>A similar 2016 study published in Public Opinion Quarterly said that media are more similar than dissimilar and, excepting political scandals, “major news organizations present topics in a largely nonpartisan manner, casting neither Democrats nor Republicans in a particularly <a href="https://5harad.com/papers/mediabias.pdf">favorable or unfavorable light</a>.”</p>
<p>Surveys show public media’s audiences do not see it as biased. A national poll of likely voters released July 14, 2025, found that <a href="https://www.mediainstitute.org/2025/07/14/new-poll-majority-of-voters-trust-public-media-more-than-media-overall/">53%</a> of respondents trust public media to report news “fully, accurately and fairly,” while only 35% extend that trust to “the media in general.” A majority also opposed eliminating federal support.</p>
<p>Contrast these numbers with attitudes about public broadcasters such as MTVA in Hungary or the TVP in Poland, where the state controls most content. <a href="https://apnews.com/article/hungarians-protest-media-propaganda-ef0f419ea38ea8d2beb4f0dd56d82d57">Protests in Budapest</a> October 2024 drew thousands demanding an end to “propaganda.” Oxford’s Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism reports that TVP is the <a href="https://notesfrompoland.com/2022/06/15/poles-trust-in-media-declines-with-state-tv-least-trusted-source-find-oxford-report/">least trusted</a> news outlet in the country.</p>
<p>While critics sometimes conflate American public broadcasting with state-run outlets, the structures are very different.</p>
<h3>Safeguards for editorial freedom</h3>
<p><a href="https://cmds.ceu.edu/sites/cmcs.ceu.hu/files/attachment/article/2091/thestateofstatemedia.pdf">In state-run media systems</a>, a government agency hires editors, dictates coverage, and provides full funding from the treasury. Public officials determine — or make up — what is newsworthy. Individual media operations survive only <a href="https://doi.org/10.4324/9781032632940-1">so long as the party in power is happy</a>.</p>
<p>Public broadcasting in the U.S. works in almost exactly the opposite way: The Corporation for Public Broadcasting is a private nonprofit with a statutory “<a href="https://www.congress.gov/event/118th-congress/senate-event/LC70974/text">firewall</a>” that forbids political interference.</p>
<p>More than <a href="https://cpb.org/faq">70% of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting’s federal appropriation</a> for 2025 of $1.1 billion flows through to roughly 1,500 independently governed local stations, most of which are NPR or PBS affiliates but <a href="https://current.org/2025/07/rescission-of-cpb-funds-seen-as-devastating-blow-to-localism/">some of which are unaffiliated community broadcasters</a>. CPB headquarters retains only about 5% of that federal funding.</p>
<p>Stations survive by combining this modest federal grant money with listener donations, underwriting, and foundation support. That creates a diversified revenue mix that further safeguards their editorial freedom.</p>
<p>And while stations share content, <a href="https://cpb.org/aboutpb/what-public-media">each also has latitude when it comes to programming and news coverage</a>, especially at the local level.</p>
<p>As a public-private partnership, individual communities mostly own the public broadcasting system and its affiliate stations. Congress allocates funds, while community nonprofits, university boards, state authorities, or other local license holders actually own and run the stations. Individual monthly donors are often called “members” and sometimes have voting rights in station-governance matters. Membership contributions make up the largest share of revenue for most stations, <a href="https://cpb.org/faq">providing another safeguard for editorial independence</a>.</p>
<h3>Broadly shared civic commons</h3>
<p>And then there are public media’s critical <a href="https://www.asc.upenn.edu/news-events/news/public-media-can-improve-our-flawed-democracy">benefits to democracy</a> itself.</p>
<p>A 2021 report from the <a href="https://www.ebu.ch/files/live/sites/ebu/files/Publications/strategic/open/News_report_2021.pdf">European Broadcasting Union</a> links public broadcasting with higher voter turnout, better factual knowledge, and lower susceptibility to extremist rhetoric.</p>
<p>Experts warn that even small cuts will exacerbate an already pernicious problem with <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/disinformation-age/role-of-public-broadcasting/CFB7BEBE687F03E1849105B3214764AB">political disinformation</a> in the U.S., as citizens lose access to free information that fosters media literacy and encourages trust across demographics.</p>
<p>In many ways, public media remains the last broadly shared civic commons. It is both commercial-free and independently edited.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2022/01/do-countries-with-better-funded-public-media-also-have-healthier-democracies-of-course-they-do/">Another study</a>, by the University of Pennsylvania’s Annenberg School in 2022, affirmed that “countries with independent and well-funded public broadcasting systems also <a href="https://www.asc.upenn.edu/news-events/news/public-media-can-improve-our-flawed-democracy">consistently have stronger democracies</a>.”</p>
<p>The study highlighted how public media works to bridge divides and foster understanding across polarized groups. Unlike commercial media, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/0093650216663364">where the profit motive often creates incentives to emphasize conflict and sensationalism</a>, public media generally seeks to provide balanced perspectives that encourage dialogue and mutual respect. Reports are often longer and <a href="https://goldsmithspress.pubpub.org/pub/z9zzdyyi/release/1">more in-depth than those by other news outlets</a>.</p>
<p>Such attention to nuance provides a critical counterweight to the fragmented, often hyperpartisan news bubbles that pervade cable news and social media. And this skillful, more balanced treatment helps to <a href="https://sites.bu.edu/pardeeatlas/advancing-human-progress-initiative/back2school/how-the-american-media-landscape-is-polarizing-the-country/">ameliorate political polarization and misinformation</a>.</p>
<p>In all, public media’s unique structure and mission <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/society/public-broadcasting-media-democracy/#">make democracy healthier in the U.S. and across the world</a>. Public media prioritizes education and civic enlightenment. It gives citizens important tools for navigating complex issues to make informed decisions — whether those decisions are about whom to vote for or about public policy itself. Maintaining and strengthening public broadcasting preserves media diversity and advances important principles of self-government.</p>
<p>Congress’s cuts to public broadcasting will diminish the range and volume of the free press and the independent reporting it provides. Ronald Reagan once described a free press as vital for the United States to succeed in its “<a href="https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/message-the-observance-national-newspaper-week-october-9-15-1983">noble experiment in self-government</a>.” From that perspective, more independent reporting — not less — will prove the best remedy for any worry about partisan spin.</p>
