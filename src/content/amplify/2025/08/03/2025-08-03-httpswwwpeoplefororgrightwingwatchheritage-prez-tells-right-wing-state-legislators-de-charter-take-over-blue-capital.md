<p>Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts urged right-wing state legislators this month to “de-charter” liberal capital cities and replace them with “state municipal districts.”</p>
<p>In a <a data-extlink="" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxQY_OSuy0c">speech</a> to a gathering of the American Legislative Exchange Council in Indianapolis, Roberts asserted, “We are in the second American Revolution,” which he explained by saying “we are renewing sovereignty and self-governance and faith in fellow man.”</p>
<p>Roberts showed no apparent recognition of the glaring inconsistency between his declared support for “sovereignty and self-governance” and his demonstrated contempt for the democratic choices made by voters in cities who disagree with Heritage’s agenda.</p>
<p>"When we have cities like Austin, or Nashville, or other capital cities whose local government is not representative of the will of the people, de-charter them and establish them as state municipal districts in the name of common sense,” he urged.</p>
<p>Roberts called Austin, Texas his “adopted home town” and described it as “a once-great place that has been taken over by Marxists.”</p>
<p>Roberts’ justification for this brazen attack on democratic self-governance? He claimed that the biggest threat to the Trump-Vance agenda, which is essentially the <a href="https://www.peoplefor.org/project-2025-real">Project 2025 agenda</a> promoted by Roberts and Heritage, is “that there are government entities that illegitimately are imposing something other than the American dream on their people.”</p>
<p>Roberts promised the legislators that Heritage would provide “air cover” if they made this virtual declaration of war against their own capital cities.</p>
<p>Roberts’ recommendation was part of a ten-point policy agenda he urged the state legislators to adopt. Among his other recommendations:</p>
<ul><li>Roll back environmental regulations—“nonsense from the Green New Scam”—that he said are contributing to a crisis in affordable housing;</li><li>End subsidies and preferential treatment for “fickle energy resources.” (He said nothing about the subsidies enjoyed by fossil-fuel industries);</li><li>Force every local law enforcement agency to sign cooperation agreements with ICE’s 287 (g) program;</li><li>Replace SAT and ACT tests with the <a data-extlink="" href="https://www.npr.org/2023/09/10/1198638538/what-to-know-classic-learning-test-florida-sat-act-colleges">Classic Learning Test</a>, which is promoted by right-wing culture warriors like Christopher Rufo and favored by conservative Christian schools and homeschoolers; the test was <a data-extlink="" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/08/us/florida-classical-learning-test-approval.html">approved for statewide use in Florida</a> in 2023. </li></ul>
<p>The Heritage Foundation is a deep-pocketed think tank that has spent 50+ years shifting the Republican Party to the right and making America <a href="https://www.peoplefor.org/rightwingwatch/post/6-ways-the-heritage-foundation-makes-america-less-free-less-just-and-less-safe">less free, less fair, and less safe</a>. It was the sponsor of <a data-extlink="" href="https://religiondispatches.org/project-2025-how-trump-loyalists-and-right-wing-leaders-are-paving-a-fast-road-to-fascism/">Project 2025</a>, which Trump falsely disavowed during his 2024 campaign before aggressively implementing its recommendations since taking power this year, putting the country on a fast road to fascism.  The American Legislative Exchange Council functions as a sort of matchmaker between corporate lobbyists and right-wing interests and state legislators eager to <a href="https://www.peoplefor.org/rightwingwatch/post/the-american-legislative-exchange-council-50-years-of-making-america-less-fair-less-safe-less-democratic">do their destructive bidding</a>.</p>
