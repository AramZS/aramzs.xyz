<p>Can the solar web invite us into a more intentional relationship with computers and connectivity?</p>
<p>In an age of abundant computation and connectivity, this was the question that animated Rhizome’s recent workshop series, Solar Web in Schools, funded by grants from Deutsche Bank Americas Foundation and the New York City Cultural Development Fund.</p>
<p>The project emerged from thinking about our own digital footprint. Over the past decade, Rhizome has created a Winchester mansion of software infrastructure on the cloud. The effort to keep legacy digital art alive has led us to spin up server after server, making our archives dependent on a vast and resource-intensive infrastructure. It’s an incongruous match for a bastion of independent digital culture.</p>
<p>As participants in the 2023 <a href="https://rhizome.org/editorial/2023/apr/05/were-getting-teiger-funding/">Teiger Foundation Climate Action Pilot</a>, we began to take a closer look at this dependency. Our erstwhile Lead Developer Mark Beasley developed a <a href="https://rhizome.org/climate-impact/">portal</a> to track Rhizome’s digital carbon footprint. This effort illustrated that server computation is the most costly aspect of common hosting infrastructure, and thus the most energy-intensive.</p>
<figure><img alt="Screenshot of the Rhizome Climate Impact Portal webpage. The background is bright cyan with a glowing circular diagram labeled “Climate,” “Portal,” and “Rhizome.” The text describes digital sustainability efforts in the arts, and a floating widget shows data from Rhizome’s Solar Server, including voltage, battery percentage, and power consumption." sizes="100vw" src="https://static.rhizome.org/media/cache/7d/93/7d9386ca56aeeb2f95eca5d6844ba84c.png" srcset="https://static.rhizome.org/media/cache/13/a2/13a270292d11ca931df49049b5a68cb5.png 520w, https://static.rhizome.org/media/cache/11/70/11708a43f31d1d24052d61c1ed17c6df.png 950w, https://static.rhizome.org/media/cache/6c/29/6c29001e0d3ded751c4a2e6cc2962fd5.png 1600w, https://static.rhizome.org/media/cache/7d/93/7d9386ca56aeeb2f95eca5d6844ba84c.png 2048w"/><figcaption>Rhizome's climate portal.

<p>But beyond resource use, is it really in keeping with Rhizome’s ethos to mirror the behavior of large platforms, gobbling up cloud computing? What other kinds of relationships with digital culture would emerge from a different approach to infrastructure?</p>
<p>We decided to explore an alternative approach by joining the “naturally intelligent” network of <a href="https://solarprotocol.net/">Solar Protocol</a>. Established by artists Tega Brain, Alex Nathanson, and Benedetta Piantella, Solar Protocol is a network of solar-powered servers. Each server can only offer sporadic connectivity that is dependent on available sunshine, the length of day, and local weather conditions. Requests for a given website are routed by the network to whatever location has the most sunshine at that time.</p>
<p>To keep the equipment required lightweight, the Solar Protocol network imposes certain constraints on websites, which offer an opportunity to get creative with the web.</p>

<p>Now…back to the workshops! Taught at four schools—Brooklyn Arbor Elementary, Waterside Studio School, PS.96, and PS.01 throughout May and June; third, fourth, and fifth grade students learned about digital art and the resources underlying their online actions. We discussed what they use the internet for (Roblox, TikTok were popular responses), what the web is made up of, and how it stays online. Students learned that the internet is a resource-intensive space which is made up of the labor of engineers and users, physical components, energy, and physical spaces.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, students shared that their internet usage is high—they use the internet, in some form, constantly. When learning about the solar server, students learned that sometimes we don’t need to be online 24/7. Humans need to take breaks, and our hardware should too. Better yet, we can plan for this so it’s not an inconvenience, but rather a short pause in our everyday lives.</p>

<p>To conclude the three-part workshops, students learned to make their own ASCII artworks, which now live on a dedicated website hosted on Rhizome’s solar server. ASCII was chosen because, unlike large, hi-res images that often contribute to website bloat, ASCII is just text and characters. If we make images solely out of text, this results in a more environmentally-friendly approach to making digital art.</p>
<p>Students “translated” their own drawings and photos to ASCII using a variety of open-source tools. Resources, including a kid-friendly guide to making digital art, our lesson plans, and workshop materials, are <a href="https://filestore.rhizome.org/s/NnA8EAiyp8TXdtJ">available to access for free</a>.
