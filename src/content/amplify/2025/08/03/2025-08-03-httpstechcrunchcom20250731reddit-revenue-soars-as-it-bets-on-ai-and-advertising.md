<p>Reddit reported its second-quarter earnings on Thursday, and it’s clear that the company’s focus on AI has ramped up considerably.</p>
<p>One significant area of investment is growing its advertising business, supported by its AI-powered marketing tools. The results revealed that the majority of Reddit’s revenue continues to come from ads, which brought in $465 million, representing 93% of the company’s total revenue.</p>
<p>Last month, Reddit launched two new features for advertisers: Reddit Insights, a tool that leverages the billions of posts and comments on the platform to spot trends and offer real-time insights for campaign strategies, and Conversation Summary Add-ons, which let advertisers include Reddit user discussions directly in ads, showing public opinions about products or brands.</p>
<p>The company also saw growth in its “other revenue” category, which includes its data licensing business — meaning its deals with AI providers for access to its data. Reddit said the category jumped 24% year-over-year to $35 million, up from $28.1 million in the same period a year prior.</p>
<p>Reddit has already established content licensing agreements with major players in AI, including Google and OpenAI. Although these deals are still new, the results from the second quarter point out a steady income stream that has significant potential for the long haul.</p>
<p>Another key AI-powered feature is the Reddit Answers tool, which launched in December. This tool, which offers answers in a conversational interface, has attracted 6 million weekly users, a considerable jump from <a href="https://s203.q4cdn.com/380862485/files/doc_financials/2025/q1/Q1-25-Shareholder-Letter.pdf">1 million</a> users in the previous quarter.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://s203.q4cdn.com/380862485/files/doc_financials/2025/q2/Q2-25-Shareholder-Letter.pdf">letter to shareholders</a>, Reddit CEO Steve Huffman said the platform is working to integrate the tool “more deeply into the core search experience” to make “search a central feature across Reddit.”</p>
