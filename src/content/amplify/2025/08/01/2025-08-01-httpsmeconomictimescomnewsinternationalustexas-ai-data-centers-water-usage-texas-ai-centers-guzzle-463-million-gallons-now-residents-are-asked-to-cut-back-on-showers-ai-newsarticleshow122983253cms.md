  Texas AI data centers water usage: As Texas faces a severe drought, the
  state's AI data centers consume millions of gallons of water daily for
  cooling, raising concerns about environmental sustainability. Residents are
  urged to conserve water while these centers operate extensively, prompting a
  call to action regarding water usage policies.

According to a July 2025 investigation by The Austin Chronicle, data centers across Central Texas, including Microsoft and US Army Corps facilities in San Antonio, used a combined 463 million gallons of water in 2023 and 2024 alone, as reported by Techie + Gamers. That’s enough water to meet the needs of tens of thousands of households, according to the report.</p><p>ALSO READ: </p><a data-ga-onclick="Inarticle articleshow link click#News#href" data-type="tilCustomLink" href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/us/prsm-missile-pentagons-new-missile-could-checkmate-china-why-everyones-talking-about-it-us-military-news/articleshow/122982803.cms?utm_source=contentofinterest&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=cppst" target="_blank">Pentagon’s new missile could checkmate China — why everyone’s talking about it</a><h2>Why Data Centers Use So Much Water</h2><p>For many Texans, this feels like a painful contradiction.

That’s about 7% of Texas’s total projected water use, according to the report.</p><p>Margaret Cook, a water policy analyst at the Houston Advanced Research Center pointed out that, “These centers are showing up in places that are very water-stressed," adding, "There’s no requirement for them to have conversations with communities about how much water they’ll use,” as quoted in the report.</p><p>Locals in the Hill Country region, where several new AI-focused centers are under construction, are raising alarms. Much of the water these centers use evaporates during cooling and can’t be recycled, a critical issue in an area already grappling with scarce water resources, as reported by Techie + Gamers.</p><h2>Microsoft’s Sustainability Promise Faces Skepticism</h2><p>While Microsoft said it’s working toward sustainability goals, aiming to be “water positive” by 2030, meaning it plans to replenish more water than it consumes, as per the report. The company highlights water restoration projects and the use of recycled water when possible, according to Techie + Gamers. </p><p>However, critics worry these efforts often happen far from the communities facing water shortages, limiting their impact.</p><p> Cook said, “You have to question what ‘water positive’ means when you’re building massive projects in places already dealing with water scarcity,” as quoted in the report.</p><p>Transparency is another problem. Some water utilities learn about new data centers only after construction is underway, and companies sometimes operate under shell entities or code names, reducing community awareness and input, as reported by Techie + Gamers.</p><p>This issue isn’t just about the future, it’s happening now, with drought conditions already severe across many parts of Texas, the expansion of AI infrastructure is testing how communities balance technological progress with environmental sustainability, as per Techie + Gamers.</p><h2>FAQs</h2><strong>Why are Texas AI data centers using so much water?</strong><p>They use water mainly to cool the servers that run around the clock, which is essential to keep the data centers operating safely.</p><strong><br/>Can the water used by data centers be recycled?</strong><p>Some water is recycled, but a large portion evaporates during cooling and is lost forever.</p></div></div>
