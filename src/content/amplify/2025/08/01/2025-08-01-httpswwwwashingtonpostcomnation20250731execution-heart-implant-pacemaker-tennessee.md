  Tennessee court rules death row inmate can be executed with pacemaker - The

<p>A lower court had ruled that Byron Black’s implanted combination pacemaker-defibrillator could prolong his suffering by shocking his heart after lethal injection.</p>
<p>A death row prisoner in Tennessee can be executed despite having an implanted heart device that his lawyers say is likely to prolong his suffering, the state Supreme Court <a href="https://www.tncourts.gov/sites/default/files/OpinionsPDFVersion/Majority%20Opinion%20-%202025-07-31T105544.690_0.pdf">ruled Thursday</a> in a first-of-its-kind legal battle.</p>
<p>A lower court had ruled that Byron Black could not be executed while his cardiac implantable electronic device — which acts as a pacemaker and a defibrillator — was on, because it could deliver painful shocks to his heart to try to revive him during a lethal injection. The Thursday ruling overturns that decision and allows Black’s scheduled execution Tuesday to proceed.</p>
