<p>In the past 24 hours, far-right internet personality Laura Loomer has majorly flexed the influence she wields over the Trump administration’s staffing decisions, claiming not one but two heads.</p>
<p>On Tuesday evening, Loomer publicly <a href="https://x.com/LauraLoomer/status/1950363597860700216">cast aspersions</a> on Jen Easterly, a former Biden cybersecurity official who was recently named to a distinguished chair position in West Point’s social sciences department.</p>
<p>Responding to the West Point dean’s since-deleted announcement of Easterly’s appointment, Loomer wrote <a href="https://x.com/LauraLoomer/status/1950363597860700216">on X</a>: “Wow [Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth]! Looks like some of your underlings are trying to screw you. There are clearly a lot of Biden holdovers at DOD undermining the Trump admin.” (Easterly, who—Loomer failed to mention—also worked in George W. Bush’s administration, has <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/us-rescinds-military-academy-job-for-former-cybersecurity-chief/ar-AA1JBwfS">publicly disputed</a> Trump’s baseless claims about recent elections being rigged.)</p>
<p>The right-wing provocateur urged a “massive” reduction in force at the Defense Department so as to weed out “moles” and tagged the accounts of West Point, the Department of Defense, and Hegseth in the post.</p>
<p>By Wednesday morning, Army Secretary Dan Driscoll publicly <a href="https://x.com/secarmy/status/1950580548029595746?s=46&amp;t=4auoNGqLGpw7cLWa3ZBm_A">shared</a> a memo stating that Easterly was dismissed,and that West Point will “immediately pause non-governmental and outside groups from selecting employees.” Driscoll also requested a “top-down review” of the academy’s hiring practices.</p>
<p>Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell <a href="https://x.com/SeanParnellUSA/status/1950590519513321646">lauded</a> the decision, and Loomer also <a href="https://x.com/LauraLoomer/status/1950604257478189506">celebrated</a> the outcome.</p>
<p>The shake-up at West Point, ostensibly the result of Loomer’s single-handed effort, comes on the heels of another victory for the self-described “pro-white nationalist,” who on Tuesday succeeded in taking down Vinay Prasad, a top official at Trump’s Food and Drug Administration.</p>
<p>Prasad was the FDA’s top vaccine official and an <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/194979/vinay-prasad-fda-trump-vaccines">adherent</a> of Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s “Make America Healthy Again” movement. But even RFK Jr.’s support wasn’t enough to shield him from Loomer’s wrath for supposed lèse-majesté against Trump.</p>
<p>Loomer launched a campaign against Prasad in recent days, <a href="https://loomered.com/2025/07/20/meet-vinay-prasad-the-progressive-leftist-saboteur-undermining-president-trumps-fda/">claiming</a> that he was a “progressive leftist saboteur undermining President Trump’s FDA.” Prasad stepped down Tuesday, with a Health Department spokesman <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/07/29/vinay-prasad-exits-fda-marty-makary-cber-director-chief-medical-scientific-officer/">saying</a> he “did not want to be a distraction to the great work of the FDA in the Trump administration.”</p>
<p>These two back-to-back Loomerings are just the latest.</p>
<p>In April, Trump <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-waltz-laura-loomer-national-security-council-959b718b04b240c5c8ba3736b4d8aa62">reportedly</a> fired a number of national security council officials for disloyalty the day after Loomer flagged them to the president as “people who have played a role in sabotaging” him. She also reportedly <a href="https://newrepublic.com/post/194720/donald-trump-mike-waltz-laura-loomer-fired">sowed doubts</a> about Mike Waltz before he was ousted from his national security adviser post.</p>
