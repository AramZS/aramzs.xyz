  Cornell Expected to Reach Settlement with Trump Administration to Restore
  Federal Funding

<p dir="ltr">Cornell University is expected to reach a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-25/cornell-is-said-to-advance-in-white-house-talks-over-cut-funding">settlement</a> with the Trump administration to restore hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funding that has been revoked over the last several months amid allegations the university failed to adequately combat campus antisemitism.</p><p dir="ltr">Columbia University and the University of Pennsylvania reached similar settlements with the Trump administration in July. </p><p dir="ltr">Cornell has been hit with several funding revocations since Trump’s Department of Justice announced in March that it was <a href="https://www.ithaca.com/news/ithaca/cornell-among-several-universities-under-federal-investigation-over-antisemitism-claims/article_8bc79788-fef6-11ef-97fd-773dd4285a5c.html">investigating</a> 60 universities, including Cornell, over antisemitism allegations. In February, the university <a href="https://www.ithaca.com/news/ithaca/cornell-university-joins-lawsuit-to-block-trump-ordered-nih-cuts/article_b8ac9ea4-e8b4-11ef-a7e6-975720fde043.html">joined a lawsuit</a> against NIH-related cuts imposed by the Trump administration and announced a university-wide hiring freeze due to financial uncertainty.</p><p dir="ltr">In April, the Trump administration put more than <a href="https://www.ithaca.com/news/ithaca/over-1-billion-of-cornell-federal-funding-frozen-trump-officials-say/article_46b558ba-9e0c-4482-936f-3d0a8a322877.html">$1 billion</a> in federal funding for Cornell on hold as the DOJ’s antisemitism investigation continued. Even though the university’s endowment is nearly $10 billion, these funds aren’t easily reallocated, and the steep decrease in federal support has driven Cornell to <a href="https://statements.cornell.edu/2025/20250618-financial-austerity.cfm">“seek optimal ways to reduce costs”</a> by firing workers and restructuring university operations and programs.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite the negative impact on the university, Cornell was one of only two Ivy League universities <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2025/06/08/columbia-cornell-only-ivies-to-not-join-amicus-brief-backing-harvard-lawsuit-against-trump-administration/">not to sign onto a lawsuit</a> initiated by Harvard to stop the Trump administration from leveraging federal funding to control academic and operational decisions at universities. The other university was Columbia.</p><p dir="ltr">Columbia’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/07/24/nyregion/columbia-trump-deal.html">settlement</a> allows the university to recoup about $400 million in terminated federal grants in exchange for paying the federal government $221 million over the next three years. Columbia also agreed to maintain its ban on protests inside academic buildings and make additional commitments to combat antisemitism, including adopting the controversial <a href="https://holocaustremembrance.com/resources/working-definition-antisemitism">International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA)</a> definition of antisemitism in disciplinary hearings. </p><p dir="ltr">An <a href="https://www.omm.com/insights/alerts-publications/president-trump-issues-executive-order-on-antisemitism/">executive order</a> from Trump’s first term, which was never overturned by the Biden administration, requires federal agencies to use IHRA’s definition of antisemitism when enforcing Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. </p><p dir="ltr">While the IHRA definition is used by many governments and a growing number of educational institutions, it’s opposed by hundreds of civil and human rights organizations, including the American Civil Liberties Union, Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, and Israel’s best-known human rights group B’Tselem because it casts certain criticism of the State of Israel as hate speech. According to a Human Rights Watch <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2023/04/04/human-rights-and-other-civil-society-groups-urge-united-nations-respect-human">letter</a> to the United Nations signed by over 100 human rights organizations, “the IHRA definition has often been used to wrongly label criticism of Israel as antisemitic, and thus chill and sometimes suppress non-violent protest, activism and speech critical of Israel.”</p><p dir="ltr">The University of Pennsylvania reached a <a href="https://www.thedp.com/article/2025/07/penn-complies-education-department-demands-title-ix-resolution-trump">settlement</a> to unfreeze about $175 million in federal funding without paying millions of dollars to the federal government. Administrators, however, instead agreed to align university policy with Trump executive orders banning transgender athletes from women’s sports.</p><p dir="ltr">For universities, agreeing to these settlements might seem like responsible decisions to secure vital sources of funding, but experts say it could also offer a sense of legitimacy to Trump’s legally-dubious policy of using the President's power to impound federal funding that was already approved by Congress as a tool to reshape higher education. </p><p dir="ltr">While Cornell law professor <a href="https://www.dorfonlaw.org/2025/07/how-bad-is-columbia-settlement-agreement.html">Michael Dorf</a> has said that the Administrative Procedures Act clearly allows recipients of federal funding to sue to stop unlawful funding cuts, he added that the Trump administration has reason to believe that the Supreme Court will side with them. “[T]he Supreme Court has showed a remarkable willingness to allow the Trump administration to proceed with its hardball policies by dissolving lower court preliminary injunctions, Dorf wrote,” adding that Columbia risked losing an estimated $4 billion in federal funding over the next three years if the Trump administration didn’t agree to the settlement.</p><p dir="ltr">“Columbia couldn’t tolerate the administration holding up billions of dollars in current and future grants, so they paid what is essentially ransom,” Dorf told the <a href="https://www.chronicle.com/article/in-extraordinary-deal-with-trump-columbia-u-agrees-to-pay-200-million-to-restore-funds">Chronicle of Higher Education.</a> “The ransom that they ended up paying strikes me as a pretty good value if you decide you’re going to pay ransom,” he added. “But the problem with paying ransom is that it incentivizes the taking of more hostages.”</p><p dir="ltr">According to University of Michigan law professor <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/columbia-s-221-million-deal-trump-officials-draws-mixed-reactions-researchers">Sam Bagenstos</a>, “This is a very disappointing development, not just for Columbia, but also for the broader academic community, because it gives fuel to the efforts by the Trump administration to overreach in its use of federal money as a threat to get universities to do its own bidding.”</p><p dir="ltr">Reporting indicates that Cornell’s settlement will be monetarily smaller than Columbia’s, though still substantial. It also remains uncertain what additional university-wide policy demands, such as adopting the IHRA definition of antisemitism, might be included in it.</p><p dir="ltr">In response to questions about the status of negotiations with the Trump administration, Cornell media relations said, “We do not have any information to share at this time.” </p><p dir="ltr">Columbia’s adoption of IHRA’s antisemitism definition caused Marianne Hirsch, a prominent Jewish scholar of genocide, to consider leaving her professorship at the university. Hirsch, whose parents survived the Holocaust, told the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/columbia-university-antisemitism-definition-68d44684f376b12162a28b88104e5d24">Associated Press</a>, “A university that treats criticism of Israel as antisemitic and threatens sanctions for those who disobey is no longer a place of open inquiry…I just don’t see how I can teach about genocide in that environment.”</p><p dir="ltr">Afaf Nasher, executive director of New York’s chapter of the <a href="https://www.cair.com/press_releases/cair-ny-calls-columbia-universitys-adoption-of-ihra-antisemitism-definition-an-attack-on-free-speech/">Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR)</a>, called Columbia’s decision to adopt the IHRA definition “an attack on free speech.” Nasher continued, “This decision is nothing more than the shameless weaponization of antisemitism in order to stifle the ability of students to speak out against the ongoing genocide of Palestinians by the Israeli government. We urge Columbia’s administration to reverse this decision.”</p><p dir="ltr">If Cornell makes similar concessions as Columbia, civil and human rights scholars at the university are expected to voice their opposition.</p><p dir="ltr">The settlements from elite universities are coming as major media companies like Paramount and Disney have reached settlements of their own with the Trump administration. Paramount <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/amp/shows/maddow/blog/rcna221067">recently agreed</a> to pay more than $16 million to settle a lawsuit with the Trump administration over a 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris that Trump claimed was deceptively edited. Just days later, CBS, which is owned by Paramount, canceled The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, and Trump’s Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approved an $8 billion merger between Paramount and Skydance. </p><hr/><h3><em>Related reporting:</em></h3><h3 dir="ltr"> </h3><p></p>
