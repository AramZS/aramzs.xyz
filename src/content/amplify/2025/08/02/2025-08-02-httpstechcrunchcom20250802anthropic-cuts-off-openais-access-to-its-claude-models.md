title: Anthropic cuts off OpenAI’s access to its Claude models
---
<p>Anthropic has revoked OpenAI’s access to its Claude family of AI models, according to <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/anthropic-revokes-openais-access-to-claude/">a report in Wired</a>.</p>
<p>Sources told Wired that OpenAI was connecting Claude to internal tools that allowed the company to compare Claude’s performance to its own models in categories like coding, writing, and safety.</p>
<p>TechCrunch has reached out to Anthropic and OpenAI for comment. In a statement to Wired, an Anthropic spokesperson said, “OpenAI’s own technical staff were also using our coding tools ahead of the launch of GPT-5,” which is apparently “a direct violation of our terms of service.” (Anthropic’s commercial terms forbid companies from using Claude to build competing services.)</p>
<p>Meanwhile, an OpenAI spokesperson said, “While we respect Anthropic’s decision to cut off our API access, it’s disappointing considering our API remains available to them.”</p>
<p>Anthropic executives had already shown resistance to providing access to competitors, with Chief Science Officer Jared Kaplan previously <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/05/anthropic-co-founder-on-cutting-access-to-windsurf-it-would-be-odd-for-us-to-sell-claude-to-openai/">justifying the company’s decision to cut off Windsurf</a> (a rumored OpenAI acquisition target, subsequently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/01/more-details-emerge-on-how-windsurfs-vcs-and-founders-got-paid-from-the-google-deal/">acquired by Cognition</a>) by saying, “I think it would be odd for us to be selling Claude to OpenAI.”</p>
