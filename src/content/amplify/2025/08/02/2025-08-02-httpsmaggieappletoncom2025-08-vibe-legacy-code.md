title: Vibe Code is Legacy Code
---
<p>A lovely little write-up by my friend  <a data-astro-cid-xcud3gru="" data-internal="false" href="https://stevekrouse.com/">Steve Krouse</a>   on how vibe code and legacy code are roughly the same thing; “code that nobody understands.”</p>
<p>I particularly like this graph which illustrates the relationship between vibe code and understanding:</p>
<figure data-astro-cid-pazku6du=""><p> </p><picture data-astro-cid-pazku6du="true">  <img alt="A line chart with vibe on the Y axis and understanding on the X axis with a downwards diagonal line" data-astro-cid-pazku6du="true" sizes="(max-width: 440px) 100vw, (max-width: 768px) 90vw, (max-width: 1024px) 85vw, 1100px" src="https://maggieappleton.com/_astro/vibe-code.xuRwkmm1_1WTuOM.png"/> </picture><p> </p></figure>
<p>This type of discussion feels helpful in a moment where the term “vibe coding” is being tossed around in vague and unhelpful ways.</p>
<p>As many have  <a data-astro-cid-xcud3gru="" data-internal="false" href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/19/vibe-coding/">pointed out</a>  , not all code written with AI assistance is vibe code. Per the  <a data-astro-cid-xcud3gru="" data-internal="false" href="https://x.com/karpathy/status/1886192184808149383">original definition</a>  , it’s code written in contexts where you “forget that the code even exists.” Or as the fairly fleshed-out  <a data-astro-cid-xcud3gru="" data-internal="false" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibe_coding">Wikipedia article</a>  puts it: ”A key part of the definition of vibe coding is that the user accepts code without full understanding.”</p>
<p>Like many developers, I’m constantly grappling with how much understanding I’m willing to hand over to Cursor or Claude Code. I sincerely try to keep it minimal, or at least have them walk me through the functionality line-by-line if I feel I’m out of my depth. But it rings true to me that it’s a continuous spectrum, and no professional developers are sitting at the all-vibes end of it.</p>
<p>Our AI minions are also exceptional tools for learning when you move too far towards the high-vibes-low-understanding end of the spectrum. I particularly like getting Claude to write me targeted exercises to practice new concepts when I get lost in generated functions or fail to implement something correctly sans-AI.</p>
