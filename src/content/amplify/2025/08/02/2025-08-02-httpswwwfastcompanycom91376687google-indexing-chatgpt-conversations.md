<p>Google is indexing conversations with ChatGPT that users have sent to friends, families, or colleagues—turning private exchanges intended for small groups into search results visible to millions.</p>
<p>A basic Google site search using part of the link created when someone proactively clicks “Share” on ChatGPT can uncover conversations where people reveal deeply personal details, including struggles with addiction, experiences of physical abuse, or serious mental health issues—sometimes even fears that <a data-internallinksmanager029f6b8e52c="1" href="https://www.fastcompany.com/section/artificial-intelligence">AI</a> models are spying on them. While the users’ identities aren’t shown by ChatGPT, some potentially identify themselves by sharing highly specific personal information during the chats.</p>
<p>A user might click “Share” to send their conversation to a close friend over WhatsApp or to save the URL for future reference. It’s unlikely they would expect that doing so could make it appear in Google search results, accessible to anyone. It’s unclear whether those affected realize their conversations with the bot are now publicly accessible after they click the Share button, presumably thinking they’re doing so to a small audience.</p>
<p>Nearly 4,500 conversations come up in results for the Google site search, though many don’t include personal details or identifying information. This is likely not the full count, as Google may not index all conversations. (Because of the personal nature of the conversations, some of which divulge highly personal information including users’ names, locations, and personal circumstances, <em>Fast Company </em>is choosing not to link to, or describe in significant detail, the conversations with the chatbot.)</p>
