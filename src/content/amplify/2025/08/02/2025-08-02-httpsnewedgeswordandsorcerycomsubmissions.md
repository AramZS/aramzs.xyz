<p><strong>LAST YEAR -&gt; THIS YEAR:</strong> Last year we bought two stories. This year we hope to buy five or six. We have also raised our starting pay rate by 1c/word from last year’s rate.</p>
<p><strong>GENRE</strong>: Sword &amp; Sorcery!</p>
<p>Our editor has spoken at length, in many venues, about what he feels S&amp;S is, and <a href="https://payhip.com/b/dVNuB">you can read his definition of the genre in issue #0 of the magazine, available for free in digital formats</a>.</p>
<p>We do not recommend genre blending, though we’ll still read such works with an open mind, and we strongly recommend against submitting works featuring standardized fantasy elements (No elves, orcs, dragons, or dwarves, please).</p>
<p>Be specific, be Weird!</p>
<p><em>Simultaneous submissions are allowed</em>, just let us know if your story is accepted elsewhere before we respond to it, and we will only look at <em>one </em>submission per author, so make it count.</p>
<p><em>Only original stories please</em>. No reprints, and this includes self-published stories, will be accepted.</p>
<p><strong>WORDCOUNT</strong>: 4,000 to 6,000 words long.</p>
<p><strong>PAY</strong>: 4c/word, possibly more (see “Crowdfunding” below)</p>
<p><strong>ELIGIBILITY</strong>: Brackenbury Books / NESS staff are not allowed to submit.</p>
<p>All others are welcome! NESS encourages submissions from writers of all backgrounds, experiences, and identities.</p>
<p><strong>RIGHTS</strong>: Standard 6-months-from-publication exclusivity. No film &amp; TV, reprint, or other rights.</p>
<p><strong>“AI”</strong>: Use of “AI”, aka LLMs, for submissions will result in an instant rejection and lifelong blacklisting.</p>
<p><strong>ART</strong>: All our stories are paired with a minimum of one original B&amp;W illustration, but so far we’ve always managed to budget for two.</p>
<p><strong>CROWDFUNDING</strong>: Our magazine is crowdfunded, and this affects a few things. It means the contract &amp; payment will be resolved in the month of April 2026, after the crowdfund has ended and the money it raises is in our hands.</p>
<p>In <em>theory</em> the 2026 crowdfund could fail, in which case you’d be free to take your story elsewhere. In practice, each year the magazine has funded better than the previous (<a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/oliverbrackenbury/new-edge-sword-and-sorcery-magazine/">2023</a>, <a href="https://www.backerkit.com/c/projects/brackenbooks/new-edge-sword-sorcery-2024">2024</a>, <a href="https://www.backerkit.com/c/projects/brackenbooks/new-edge-sword-sorcery-2024">2025</a>) and as these words are typed we’ve successfully funded all six crowdfunds we’ve run for any magazine or book we publish. We are quite confident our 2026 magazine crowdfund will succeed.</p>
<p>Pay raises are a standard stretch goal for our magazine crowdfunds, so it is <em>possible</em> our rate will go above 4c/word.</p>
<p><strong>SEND YOUR SUBMISSION</strong>: to “heynessmystoryisthebest@gmail.com” in .doc, .docx, or .pdf format only.</p>
<p>Something close to standard manuscript formatting is preferred but not required. <strong>Do not</strong> include your mailing address, or worry about writing a cover letter.</p>
<p>DEADLINE: 8am EST, September 1st, 2025</p>
<p>Submissions received afterward will not be responded to.</p>
<p>All rejections will be form rejections.</p>
