<p>Tech industry CEOs have lavished gifts, flattery and attention on President Trump. The administration has rolled out industry-friendly policies.</p>
<p>Lavish gifts, public flattery and hefty domestic investments have become the currency of influence in Trump’s Washington.</p>
<p>Apple CEO Tim Cook, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and the leaders of other highly valued tech companies have forged alliances with President Donald Trump through sometimes-fawning spectacles and delicate behind-the-scenes conversations. The administration has rolled out industry-friendly executive orders and exemptions from policies that threatened these owners’ multitrillion-dollar businesses.</p>
