<p>The museum removed a placard describing the president’s two impeachments last week. The new text makes minor changes -- and offers slightly less detail.</p>
<p>The Smithsonian’s National Museum of American History on Friday unveiled an updated impeachment display that now includes context about President Donald Trump’s historic cases — a change the institution made a week after The Washington Post reported that a temporary placard containing his name had been <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/2025/07/31/trump-impeachment-smithsonian/">removed</a> from the exhibit as part of a Smithsonian content review prompted by White House pressure to oust a museum director. The new text makes minor changes to — and offers slightly fewer details than — the temporary signage.</p>
