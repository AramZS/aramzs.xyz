title: Why Has the Tesla Diner Already Gutted Most of Its Menu?
---
<div><div><div><p>Just two weeks after <a href="https://la.eater.com/restaurant-openings/286960/tesla-diner-elon-musk-los-angeles-restaurant-opening-july-21">Tesla Diner opened in Hollywood</a>, the charging station-cum-restaurant is already falling well short of its promises. Despite the initial <a href="https://x.com/niccruzpatane/status/1949529831219110200">huge lines of people and cars,</a> the <a href="https://la.eater.com/restaurant-openings/287015/tesla-diner-los-angeles-full-menu-reveal">menu appears to have been greatly condensed</a>. At opening, the diner served biscuits and gravy, cinnamon rolls, and soft serve in addition to burgers, waffles, and breakfast sandwiches.</p></div><div><p>As of August 5, only five sandwiches, two sides, two flavors of pie, shakes, and some soft drinks were available to order from the in-car Tesla infotainment system. <a href="https://la.eater.com/scene-report/287082/tesla-diner-los-angeles-food-dishes-tech-design-review">Even the Epic Bacon </a>has been taken off the menu, with non-epic bacon available as an add-on to burgers and grilled cheese sandwiches, but no longer as a standalone item. Tesla Diner chef Eric Greenspan told Eater over text that the menu would be “forever evolving,” and that the “unprecedented demand” led to the team scaling down the menu for efficiency. Greenspan also said Easter eggs and specials would be added here and there.</p></div><div><p>Dishes originally on the menu that have been removed include the market salad, club sandwich, hash brown bites, biscuits and red gravy, and chocolate chip cookies. The veggie patty option for the burger is also no longer available. Breakfast items like waffles that were once listed as “all-day breakfast,” implying they were available all the time, are now only served in the mornings. Greenspan said soft serve ice cream would be back on the menu later this week, so the farm could meet the increased demand, while the biscuits would return as a special “sooner rather than later.” The reimagined classic fountain drinks, including Shirley Temples and Creamsicles, are gone.</p></div><div><p>While the Tesla Diner marketed itself as a 24-hour restaurant, reports from some drivers say <a href="https://sfist.com/2025/07/24/tesla-branded-diner-has-opened-in-la/">non-Tesla vehicles are not allowed to charge on the premises</a>, while its hours of operation are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/05/dining/tesla-diner-elon-musk.html">limited to 6 a.m. to midnight</a>, except for those charging and ordering through their Teslas. <a href="https://la.eater.com/restaurant-openings/286984/tesla-diner-los-angeles-ordering-geofence">The vaunted screen-ordering system</a> with the geofence alert wasn’t working off-premises as of August 5, but Tesla drivers were able to order from their cars once they parked and began charging.</p></div><div><div><p></p><p>Chef Eric Greenspan said that the menu would be “forever evolving.”</p></div></div><div><p>Tesla <a href="https://la.eater.com/2018/1/8/16863106/tesla-elon-musk-restaurant-carhop-roller-skates-los-angeles">CEO Elon Musk first announced Tesla Diner in 2018</a>, and it finally <a href="https://la.eater.com/2025/5/15/24430942/elon-musk-tesla-diner-los-angeles-interior-first-look">opened seven years later</a> with a sleek, retro-futuristic two-story building by Hans von Holzhausen, the company’s head of design. In the years since announcing the diner, Musk has become an increasingly polarizing figure, with the controversy around him hitting a fever pitch around the 2024 presidential election, where he endorsed and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/01/31/elon-musk-trump-donor-2024-election/">heavily funded President Trump’s campaign</a>. After Trump took office, Musk was installed as the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c23vkd57471o">head of the Department of Government Efficiency</a> (DOGE), cutting tens of thousands of federal jobs and enacting devastating cuts to U.S. humanitarian aid, among numerous other heavily criticized actions. Musk also gave <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/24/world/europe/elon-musk-roman-salute-nazi.html">a gesture during President Trump’s inauguration</a> that has been widely likened to a Nazi salute, leading to widespread backlash. Musk and Trump <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/415872/elon-musk-and-donald-trumps-fallout-explained">have since had a falling out</a>, with Musk <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/cover-musk-floods-posts-attacking-trump-epstein/story?id=123836343">hurling insults at the President on X</a> over his close relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. A recent Gallup poll <a href="https://sfist.com/2025/08/05/majority-of-americans-dislike-trump-and-newsom-but-they-hate-elon-musk-more-according-to-gallup-poll/">shows Musk as the most disliked person </a>in America.</p></div><div><div><div><p><figcaption>Grilled cheese sandwich with non-epic bacon, with the cheese not fully melted and the bread burned at Tesla Diner on August 5, 2025.</figcaption> <cite>Matthew Kang</cite></p></div></div></div><div><p>In March 2025<em>, the New York Times </em><a href="https://la.eater.com/2025/3/27/24395482/elon-musk-los-angeles-tesla-restaurant-chef-eric-greenspan">reported that Greenspan</a> (Greenspan’s Grilled Cheese, MrBeast Burger) would lead the kitchen at Tesla Diner. Operations are managed by LA restaurateur Bill Chait, who is behind the openings of Republique, Bestia, and Firstborn, and continues to be involved in Tartine both in the U.S. and abroad.</p></div><div><p>Tesla Diner’s opening came with swift backlash both on social media and in person, with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s92xQl9Om1I">protests taking place outside the restaurant within the first weekend</a>. Multiple outlets report neighbors <a href="https://www.404media.co/living-next-to-tesla-diner-is-absolute-hell-neighbors-say/">shared their concerns about the diner</a>, including those whose <a href="https://ktla.com/news/california/giant-tesla-diner-movie-screen-erected-in-front-of-apartment-balconies-in-hollywood/">balconies are blocked by the 40-foot screens</a>. TMZ reported that a <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2025/07/28/woman-injured-by-falling-umbrella-tesla-diner-hollywood/">falling table shade injured a woman’s head</a> and nearly struck her baby; the family has said they plan to sue Tesla over the incident.</p></div><div><p>Los Angeles-based <em>New York Times </em>restaurant critic Tejal Rao offered an early review of the diner on August 5, noting the lack of menu items from the opening. Rao called the chicken tenders “agreeable,” while the all-beef hot dog had “withered” by the time she ate it on the second-floor balcony. The burger, whose patty gets smashed by a Tesla-designed device, “didn’t stand out in any meaningful way,” wrote Rao. And Optimus, the second-floor popcorn robot, was nowhere to be found.<br/>Tesla’s product rollouts are often accompanied by long delays (Cybertruck, the second generation Roadster, full self-driving capabilities, RoboTaxi, etc.) and significant quality issues. Now that the car company has ventured into the restaurant business, it’s becoming clear that operating a diner is fraught <a href="https://www.eater.com/24241174/restaurant-owners-chefs-explain-restaurant-pricing">with its own set of challenges, including service, labor, and food costs</a>. Whether Tesla Diner manages to bring back much of its menu or <a href="https://www.techtimes.com/articles/310266/20250508/tesla-pulls-plug-cybertruck-range-extender-rolls-out-refunds-canceled-battery-upgrade.htm">runs out of range</a> (still) remains to be seen.</p></div><div><div><div><p><figcaption>LOS ANGELES, CA - JULY 21: Tesla electric vehicles charge as people wait in line outside the Tesla Diner and Drive-In restaurant and Supercharger on July 21, 2025 in Los Angeles, California.
