Ayres worried that a new program under traditional Medicare will involve the types of pre-approval hassles for medical care that she had tried to avoid.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Like millions of older adults, Frances L. Ayres faced a choice when picking health insurance: Pay more for traditional Medicare, or opt for a plan offered by a private insurer and risk drawn-out fights over coverage.</p>
<p>Private insurers often require a cumbersome review process that frequently results in the denial or delay of essential treatments that are readily covered by traditional Medicare. This practice, known as prior authorization, has drawn <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/20/health/health-insurance-prior-authorization.html">public scrutiny</a>, which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/10/nyregion/uhc-shooting-luigi-mangione-brian-thompson.html">intensified</a> after the murder of a UnitedHealthcare executive last December.</p>
<p>Ms. Ayres, a 74-year-old retired accounting professor, said she wanted to avoid the hassle that has been associated with such practices under Medicare Advantage, which are private plans financed by the U.S. government. Now, she is concerned she will face those denials anyway.</p>
