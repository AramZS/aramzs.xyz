<p>On the southwest side of Minneapolis, a school shooter killed two students and injured more than a dozen others while classes celebrated their first Mass.</p>
<p>MINNEAPOLIS — The children filed into the pews of Annunciation Catholic Church on Wednesday morning for their first Mass of the new school year, a time of nervous energy and excitement. The theme of the coming term was borrowed from the prophet Jeremiah: “A future filled with hope.”</p>
