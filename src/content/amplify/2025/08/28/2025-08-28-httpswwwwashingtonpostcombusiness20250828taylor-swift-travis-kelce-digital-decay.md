  First report of Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce’s romance is gone from the web -
  The Washington Post

<p>The disappearance of a prescient 2023 item on the Messenger’s news site highlights the broader problem of digital decay.</p>
<p>Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce’s love story may be forever and always, but the internet is not.</p>
<p>On Sept. 12, 2023, a news outlet called the Messenger beat out celebrity news giants like People, TMZ, and the New York Post’s Page Six when it reported the scoop that the pop superstar had paired up with Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce.</p>
<p>“Nearly two months after Travis Kelce tried to give Taylor Swift his number, a source tells The Messenger that the duo has indeed linked up,” the report read. “‘Taylor and Travis have been quietly hanging out,’ the source said. ‘She saw him when she was in NYC a few weeks ago.’”</p>
<p>The rest is history. On Tuesday, Swift and Kelce <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/2025/08/26/taylor-swift-travis-kelce-engaged/">announced</a> their engagement, nearly two years after the Messenger’s first reported news of their first flirtations.</p>

<h2>Podcast episode</h2>
<h2>Taylor and Travis: It's a love — and business — story</h2>
<p>Taylor Swift, the world’s biggest pop star, is engaged. What could it mean for her career and for her business?</p>
<p>But the <a href="https://themessenger.com/entertainment/taylor-swift-travis-kelce-quietly-hanging-out-source-exclusive">link to that news story</a> is dead, yielding only the Messenger’s logo and a generic email address. No article. No news. That’s because the Messenger’s owner, Jimmy Finkelstein, shut it down on Jan. 31, 2024 — eight months after launch and four months after the Swift-Kelce scoop.</p>

<p>Lanae Brody, now a senior entertainment reporter at Parade, broke the news. Christina Dugan Ramirez, now an entertainment writer at Fox News Digital, helped with writing the piece.</p>
<p>Brody, a self-described Swiftie who has been covering entertainment for nearly two decades, told The Washington Post she spent about two months following leads about Swift spending time with “somebody who was into fitness,” maybe even an athlete.</p>
<p>The breakthrough came when Brody remembered hearing Travis Kelce on a podcast talking about wanting to meet Swift. “I just started thinking in my head, I wonder if this is who it could be,” she said. “And sure enough, that’s who it was.”</p>
<p>When the Messenger shut down months later, Brody and Dugan Ramirez rushed to save the text of the article. “That piece of reporting will probably go down in history as one of my most coveted, hard-worked-on, patient, persistent, sought-through-and-through-till-the-finish-line stories,” Brody said.</p>
<p>The Wayback Machine, a digital repository of the web run by the nonprofit Internet Archive, still hosts <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20231129230853/https://themessenger.com/entertainment/taylor-swift-travis-kelce-quietly-hanging-out-source-exclusive">archived versions</a> of the article.</p>
<p>At only 340 words, it’s a short item that mentions the anonymous tip, says the Swift and Kelce camps declined to comment, recaps readers on Kelce’s pronouncement that he was “a little butthurt” that he hadn’t met her after an Eras Tour concert in Kansas City, and recaps the flamed-out romance between Swift and the 1975’s singer, Matty Healy, months earlier.</p>
<p>Short, quippy, sometimes scoopy articles were hallmarks of the Messenger during its short tenure on the internet. The company hired 300 people — including an editor in chief who made an eye-popping <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2024/02/how-the-messenger-bled-out-usd50-million.html">$900,000</a> salary — and burned through <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/media/2024/01/14/messenger-layoffs-jimmy-finkelstein/">$50 million</a> in a year and a half. The New York Times reported that the site only made <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/04/business/media/the-messenger-financial-strain.html">$3 million</a> in revenue in 2023.</p>
<p>Now, the Messenger’s site isn’t even a graveyard of former articles; it’s just gone. It’s an example of so-called digital decay, the degradation of the usable web — and all of its hyperlinks — over time.</p>
<p>Pew Research Center <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/data-labs/2024/05/17/when-online-content-disappears/">reported</a> in 2024 that nearly 40 percent of webpages it identified as active in 2013 weren’t usable a decade later. Mostly that was because owners deleted or removed them, but broken links and mismanaged websites also contribute to the overall degradation of the usable web.</p>
<p>Aaron Smith, who led the Pew study, said digital decay creates real challenges for readers trying to access the context and sources that reporters provided. “As a reporter, you want to add context that helps your readers figure out how to make sense of the thing you’re talking about if someone’s reading your article a year from now, much less five years from now or 10 years from now,” Smith said. “But much of that context may no longer be there.”</p>
<p>The Swift-Kelce story survives only because of digital preservation efforts. Mark Graham, director of the Wayback Machine at the Internet Archive, was able to locate the article using the organization’s full-text search capabilities for the archives of the Messenger, which proved to be only one of many “platforms that we know to be inherently ephemeral and at risk.”</p>
<p>“It’s as if we made one copy of every book ever published and stored them all in one library,” he said. “We’d look at that and say, ‘That’s odd. What if that library burns down?’”</p>
<p>Adam Rose, COO of the Starling Lab for Data Integrity, an academic research center at Stanford and the University of Southern California, sees the Swift-Kelce case as emblematic of broader digital preservation challenges. “Whether you are someone as famous as Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce, or whether it’s you and me or anyone else,” he said, “we don’t know what to expect will be there forever and what might disappear overnight. We have a shared history and culture that is at risk.”</p>
<p>There are various forms of digital decay, Rose said. A company could go out of business, governments could take down websites they don’t like, or technology could be gradually obsolescent. (Try using a floppy disk, finding a CD player, or syncing an old iPod today.) In the Messenger’s case, the company simply couldn’t — or wouldn’t — pay to maintain its web presence after shutting down operations.</p>
<p>For Brody, the experience of seeing her career-defining scoop reduced to a dead link has been both frustrating and validating. While the original article may be gone from its initial home, it lives on in its outsize influence at the time.</p>
<p>“Although it’s not clickable on the website anymore … it’s on Parade, it’s on The Washington Post, it’s still on Entertainment Tonight and TMZ and Extra and all the places that picked it up and credited it back in the day,” she said. “Would it be cool to still be able to go to the original site and see it? Of course.”</p>
<p>correctionA previous version of this article incorrectly said the Messenger shut down 18 months after it launched. The site shut down after eight months. Additionally, Messenger was misspelled as Messanger in a previous version of this correction.</p>
