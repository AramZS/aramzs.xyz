<p>Susan Monarez, who just weeks ago became director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, has abruptly left her job after a tumultuous month that included dramatic shifts in vaccine policy and layoffs of the agency’s work force.</p>
<p>People familiar with the matter, who spoke anonymously for fear of retribution, said Dr. Monarez appeared to have run afoul of Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. by objecting to his changes to the panel of experts who advise the agency on vaccine policy.</p>
<p>Dr. Monarez is an infectious disease researcher and the first non-physician to lead the C.D.C. in more than 50 years. She had been acting director of the agency since President Trump took office. She was nominated to the top post after the president withdrew his first choice, Dr. David Weldon.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Health and Human Services Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>
<p>During her tenure under Mr. Kennedy, Dr. Monarez was expected to run her plans by Matt Buckham, the new chief of staff at H.H.S., and by Matt Buzelli, the chief of staff at C.D.C., according to a person familiar with the arrangement.</p>
<p>Her brief leadership included dealing with the fallout from decisions by Mr. Kennedy, who had unseated members of an influential vaccine advisory committee and replaced them with some staunch opponents of existing immunization policies.</p>
<p>Mr. Kennedy has also severely reduced the work force, sharply cut back C.D.C. funding and eliminated some core functions of the agency.</p>
<p>Late last week, H.H.S. confirmed that a vocal Covid vaccine opponent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/22/health/covid-vaccines-rfk.html">had been appointed to lead</a> a subcommittee reviewing safety of the shots, upsetting public health experts.</p>
<p>Several agency staff members said that Dr. Monarez had earned their appreciation for her empathetic response to the shooting at the C.D.C. earlier this month.</p>
<p>A gunman fired hundreds of rounds at the agency’s main headquarters building in Atlanta, killing a police officer, shattering windows and terrifying employees. Law enforcement officials said the 30-year-old gunman believed he had been harmed by the coronavirus vaccine.</p>
<p>C.D.C. employees responded by issuing an open letter pleading with Mr. Kennedy, who has repeatedly cast doubt on Covid shots and other vaccines, to stop spreading “inaccurate information.”</p>
<p>Dr. Monarez, while not pointing a finger at the health secretary, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/suspected-gunman-cdc-shooting-fired-500-rounds-officials/story?id=124577732">echoed their concerns</a> about misinformation in a note to employees.</p>
