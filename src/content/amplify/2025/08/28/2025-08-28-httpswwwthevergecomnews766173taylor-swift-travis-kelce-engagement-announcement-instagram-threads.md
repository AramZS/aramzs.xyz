<p>The world’s most famous celebrity couple got engaged, and the first place the news broke was on Instagram. By now, it’s not much of a surprise that pop star Taylor Swift and football player Travis Kelce opted to announce their engagement on the platform on Tuesday — if it’s <a href="https://www.glamour.com/story/beyonce-pregnancy-announcement-most-liked-instagram-photo-of-2017">good enough for Beyoncé</a>, it’s good enough for anyone.</p>
<p>Swift and Kelce are, for the most part, completely unrelatable to the rest of us — due to their wealth and fame, they occupy an entirely different reality that the average person can’t even conceptualize. But one thing actually does make them kind of like us: Instagram is the “I’m getting married!” website (it’s also the “I’m having a baby” website) in the same way LinkedIn is the “I got/need a new job” place.</p>

<p>Celebrities and public figures are surrounded by entire teams of people who carefully strategize and plan what, where, and how to post things online. They nitpick captions, which photo comes first, and when to share news. So which platforms got the Swift-Kelce nuptials and which didn’t? It may seem insignificant, but there is no doubt a lot of time, money, and attention that went into it all.</p>
<p>Instagram is the obvious winner here, but it’s also not a high bar — if you’re of a certain age demographic, it might feel like all you see on there is people getting engaged. More surprisingly, Swift crossposted the engagement photos on Threads, which I’m sure Meta is thrilled by given it’s not exactly the place you go for timely, breaking news.</p>
