title: How good are generalist AI tools at identifying public figures in videos?

<p>Two weeks ago, I was stumped by several TikTok accounts that used AI avatars to spread misinformation.</p>
<p>The videos appeared to use deepfakes of real people, but I didn’t recognize the faces. I tried using Google Lens to reverse search stills from the videos but the results were mixed. The tool – which is reachable by right-clicking on an image in Chrome – often refused my request with the message, “Results for people are limited.” While I recognized several of the deepfaked speakers, the lack of matches meant I had to leave several others out of <a href="https://indicator.media/p/dozens-of-tiktok-accounts-use-ai-avatars-of-real-journalists-to-spread-fake-news">my article</a>.</p>

<p>I tried the same searches with AI Mode, a feature in Google Search. It was more willing to give results – but also more likely to make mistakes. For example, it misidentified former Univision anchor Jorge Ramos as CNN’s Anderson Cooper, even though the two are hardly similar.</p>

<p>Multimodality is one of the most promising aspects of generative AI. You should be able to combine text and visual elements into a prompt and receive a response that engages with both elements, courtesy of computer vision.</p>
<p>This should in principle make AI search tools a great ally for fact-checkers and other investigators. Images and videos used out of context are <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11697?utm_campaign=how-good-are-generalist-ai-tools-at-identifying-public-figures-in-videos&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=indicator.media">a dominant form</a> of widespread misinformation. Deepfaked videos and AI-generated images of people are also surging.</p>
<p>And yet AI tools can badly bungle image searches. Full Fact <a href="https://fullfact.org/technology/technologyinaccurate-google-ai-overviews/?utm_campaign=how-good-are-generalist-ai-tools-at-identifying-public-figures-in-videos&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=indicator.media">found several instances</a> of Google’s AI tools repeating false claims about miscaptioned footage that the British fact-checking organization had already debunked. A Tow Center <a href="https://www.cjr.org/tow_center/why-ai-models-are-bad-at-verifying-photos.php?utm_campaign=how-good-are-generalist-ai-tools-at-identifying-public-figures-in-videos&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=indicator.media">study</a> out this week found that seven mainstream AI chatbots failed to consistently identify the location and source of ten different images, which aligns with <a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/resources/how-tos/2025/06/06/have-llms-finally-mastered-geolocation/?utm_campaign=how-good-are-generalist-ai-tools-at-identifying-public-figures-in-videos&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=indicator.media">recent geolocation</a> <a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/resources/2025/08/14/llms-vs-geolocation-gpt-5-performs-worse-than-other-ai-models/?utm_campaign=how-good-are-generalist-ai-tools-at-identifying-public-figures-in-videos&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=indicator.media">experiments</a> from Bellingcat.</p>
<p>When it comes to identifying people, the most accurate results typically come from a dedicated facial recognition tool. But as Craig <a href="https://indicator.media/p/facial-recognition-privacy-images-ownership-pimeyes">recently wrote for Indicator</a>, these services often have murky ownership and privacy practices, which makes me hesitant to use them.</p>
<p>I wanted to see if LLMs might offer a reasonable alternative for my use case of recognizing individuals featured in videos. I ran more than 100 tests across three of Google’s AI tools (Lens, AI Mode, and Gemini<a data-skip-tracking="true" href="https://indicator.media/p/how-good-are-generalist-ai-tools-at-identifying-public-figures-in-videos#b-c1c56049-8aba-4fb9-87cc-fabb6ed28978"><sup>1</sup></a>), as well as with ChatGPT, Claude, Mistral, and Perplexity. I also conducted some of the same searches on <a href="https://tineye.com/?utm_campaign=how-good-are-generalist-ai-tools-at-identifying-public-figures-in-videos&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=indicator.media">TinEye</a>, a traditional reverse image search tool, to compare results.</p>
<p>Here’s a breakdown of what I found out.</p>
