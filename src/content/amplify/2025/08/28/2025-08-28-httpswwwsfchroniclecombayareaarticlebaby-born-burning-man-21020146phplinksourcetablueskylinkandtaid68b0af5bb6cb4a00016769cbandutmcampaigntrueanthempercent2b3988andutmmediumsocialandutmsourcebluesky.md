<p>A Burning Man attendee gave birth this week at the temporary city erected in Nevada’s Black Rock Desert, according to festivalgoers.</p>
<p>Two Burners told the Chronicle on Thursday morning that a Burning Man organizer confirmed to them that a person gave birth to a baby girl either Monday evening or Tuesday morning. Burning Man spokespeople did not immediately respond to a Chronicle’s inquiry.</p>
<p>“It’s kind of a big joyous occasion,” said Charles Mae Wanamaker of Vallejo (whose spouse is a Chronicle editor), adding that she did not know when or where the birth occurred because it apparently happened during the last big storm that soaked the Playa this week.</p>
<p>The baby has been nicknamed Puddles, a nod to the circumstances of her birth, she said.</p>
<p>“We’re all kind of jokingly calling her Citizen Zero, so she’s the first official Black Rock citizen,” the 42-year-old said. “Talk about the rainbow after the rain, man, it’s so wonderful and it just fills you with so much hope and so much joy to know that literally the next generation is here.”</p>
<p>Hope Nastri, a friend of Wanamaker, described the birth as a “momentous occasion.”</p>
<p>As a mother, she said the conditions at Burning Man would make it challenging to have children, “but it’s really, really cool.”</p>
<p>“This is such a weird, unique, incredible place,” Nastri, 56, said. “Having something that joyous and beautiful happen here, it’s pretty spectacular.”</p>
