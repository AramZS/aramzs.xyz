<p>Louisiana and Black voters delivered opposing briefs to the U.S. Supreme Court Wednesday, setting the stage for arguments this fall that could <a href="https://www.democracydocket.com/news-alerts/scotus-could-be-set-to-end-key-protection-for-minority-voters/">determine</a> the future of the Voting Rights Act and minority political representation.</p>
<p>Louisiana told the justices it will no longer defend the court-ordered map that added a second majority-Black congressional district. Instead, the state argued that any use of race in redistricting is unconstitutional.</p>
<p>Until now, Louisiana had sought to defend its map, arguing that it was required by a court to draw it, after an earlier map had been found to be racially discriminatory.</p>
<p>“Louisiana wants out of this abhorrent system of racial discrimination,” the state wrote in Wednesday’s brief. “The Court should answer yes to the question presented for reargument — the intentional creation of a second majority-minority district in S.B. 8 is unconstitutional.”</p>
<p>The state’s <a href="https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2025-08-27-LAs-supplemental-brief.pdf">brief</a> compared Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act to the race-conscious college admissions policies struck down by the court in 2023.</p>
<p>“Race-based redistricting is categorically unconstitutional for all the reasons race-based admissions programs are likewise unconstitutional,” the state added. “They should also end race-based redistricting. For the use of race in race-based admissions programs is just like the drawing of district lines to create majority-minority districts under Section 2.”</p>
<p>Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill (R) doubled down in a statement after the brief was filed, <a data-id="https://x.com/aglizmurrill/status/1960780740854992984?s=46" data-type="link" href="https://x.com/aglizmurrill/status/1960780740854992984?s=46">blasting</a> compliance with the Voting Rights Act as an “abhorrent system.”</p>
<p>“Our Constitution prohibits the sorting of Americans into voting districts based on their skin color — and Louisiana wants no part of that abhorrent system,” Murrill said, acknowledging the state only drew the second majority-Black district “under protest” because federal courts had struck down its prior map for discriminating against Black voters.</p>
<p>Black voters, represented by pro-voting groups the NAACP Legal Defense Fund and ACLU, argued that the Voting Rights Act remains essential to preventing discrimination in Louisiana and beyond.</p>
<p>The voters called the law “the crown jewel of civil rights legislation” and <a href="https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2025-08-27-Robinson-appellants-supplemental-brief.pdf">reminded</a> the court that multiple lower courts already found Louisiana’s prior map illegally diluted Black voting power.</p>
<p>“Seven federal judges all agreed that, based on present conditions in Louisiana, the Legislature’s 2022 congressional map likely unlawfully diluted the votes of Black Louisianians in violation of Section 2 of the VRA,” the plaintiffs argued. “The notion that the sun has set on the need for race-conscious remedial redistricting is contrary to both the fact of ongoing discrimination in Louisiana and the text and purpose of Section 2.”</p>
<p>The plaintiffs firmly rejected Louisiana’s push for a “colorblind” approach that ignores present-day discrimination.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in October.</p>
<p>At stake is not just Louisiana’s congressional map but whether drawing majority-minority districts to protect against racial vote dilution is unconstitutional. A sweeping ruling against Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act could strip minority voters of one of the few remaining tools to ensure equal representation.</p>
<p>An Arizona court rejected a lawsuit brought by right-wing groups that sought to limit how election officials verify mail-in ballot signatures.</p>
