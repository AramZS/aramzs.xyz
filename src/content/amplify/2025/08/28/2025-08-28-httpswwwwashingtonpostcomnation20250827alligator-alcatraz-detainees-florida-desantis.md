  Alligator Alcatraz being emptied of immigrant detainees, Florida says - The
  Washington Post

<p>The plan is for the number to dwindle to zero this week, eight weeks after the controversial facility opened in the Everglades.</p>
<p>Two months after it opened, the controversial immigrant detention center hastily erected in the middle of the Everglades is losing all of its detainees, a state official said in an email.</p>
<p>Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) said Wednesday that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security has “increased the pace of the removals” from Alligator Alcatraz, but he did not comment on the facility possibly being emptied entirely of detainees after a federal judge ruled last week that the site must be dismantled by late October.</p>
