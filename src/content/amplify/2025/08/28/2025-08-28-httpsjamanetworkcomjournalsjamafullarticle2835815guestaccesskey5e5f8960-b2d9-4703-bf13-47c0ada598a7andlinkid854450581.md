title: Professional Responsibility for COVID-19 Vaccination in Pregnancy
---
<p>On May 27, 2025, Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/05/27/nx-s1-5413179/covid-vaccine-children-pregnant-rfk-cdc">announced that</a> “the COVID vaccine for healthy children and healthy pregnant women has been removed from the CDC recommended immunization schedule.” The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) subsequently updated its guidance, removing COVID-19 vaccine recommendations for children younger than 18 years and pregnant women, instead recommending “<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/vaccine-recommendations/shared-clinical-decision-making.html">shared decision-making</a>” for children and advising <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/imz-schedules/adult-easyread.html">pregnant women</a> to “talk to your health care provider about which vaccines are right for you.” This <a href="https://www.acog.org/news/news-releases/2025/05/acog-statement-on-hhs-recommendations-regarding-the-covid-vaccine-during-pregnancy">abrupt policy reversal</a>, made without transparent scientific deliberation, risks immediate and serious consequences for maternal and neonatal health across the country and introduces serious clinical, ethical, and policy consequences. It risks undermining public trust in evidence-based medicine and reducing vaccine uptake among pregnant patients who depend on authoritative guidance. The decision may also limit access by influencing insurance coverage for preventive care, despite robust data support for vaccination during pregnancy. Thirty-two organizations, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association, have <a href="https://www.acog.org/news/news-releases/2025/06/open-letter-urging-covid-19-vaccination-coverage-in-pregnancy">reaffirmed their strong endorsement</a> of COVID-19 vaccination for pregnant and lactating individuals, reflecting a continued commitment to patient safety and scientific integrity.</p>
