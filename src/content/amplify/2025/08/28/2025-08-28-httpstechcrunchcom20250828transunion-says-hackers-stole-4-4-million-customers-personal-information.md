<p>Credit reporting giant TransUnion has disclosed a data breach affecting more than 4.4 million customers’ personal information.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.maine.gov/agviewer/content/ag/985235c7-cb95-4be2-8792-a1252b4f8318/3dcd9b7c-bce3-4685-bffd-f728ce96e2fd.html?7194ef805fa2d04b0f7e8c9521f97343">filing with Maine’s attorney general’s office</a> on Thursday, TransUnion attributed the July 28 breach to unauthorized access of a third-party application storing customers’ personal data for its U.S. consumer support operations.</p>
<p>TransUnion claimed “no credit information was accessed,” but provided no immediate evidence for its claim. The data breach notice did not specify what specific types of personal data were stolen.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26078139-transunion-breach-texas/">a separate data breach disclosure</a> filed later on Thursday with Texas’ attorney general’s office, TransUnion confirmed that the stolen personal information includes customers’ names, dates of birth, and Social Security numbers.</p>
<p>When reached by TechCrunch, TransUnion spokesperson Jon Boughtin would not answer questions related to the company’s data breach, or say what types of customers’ personally identifiable information were taken.</p>
<p>TransUnion is one of the largest credit reporting agencies in the United States, and stores the <a href="https://www.transunion.com/blog/credit-data-economic-population-research">financial data of more than 260 million Americans</a>. It’s the latest U.S. corporate giant to have been hacked in recent weeks following a wave of hacks targeting <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/23/us-insurance-giant-aflac-says-customers-personal-data-stolen-during-cyberattack/">the insurance</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/10/authorities-arrest-four-hackers-linked-to-uk-retail-hacking-spree/">retail</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/28/fbi-cybersecurity-firms-say-scattered-spider-hackers-now-targeting-airlines-transportation-sector/">transportation and airline industries</a>.</p>
<p>Several companies, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/06/google-says-hackers-stole-its-customers-data-in-a-breach-of-its-salesforce-database/">Google</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/18/allianz-life-data-breach-affects-1-1-million-customers/">insurance giant Allianz Life</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/05/hacker-used-a-voice-phishing-attack-to-steal-cisco-customers-personal-information/">Cisco</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/18/hr-giant-workday-says-hackers-stole-personal-data-in-recent-breach/">HR giant Workday</a>, reported data breaches of customer data stored in their Salesforce-hosted cloud databases. Following its breach, Google attributed the hacks to an extortion group known as ShinyHunters.</p>
<p>It’s not clear who is behind the breach at TransUnion, or if the hackers made any demands to the company.</p>
<p><em>Updated with a response from TransUnion, and updated with additional details from the Texas state filing.</em></p>
