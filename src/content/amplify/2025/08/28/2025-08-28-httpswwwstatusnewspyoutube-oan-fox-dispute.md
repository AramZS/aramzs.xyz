<p>In late 2020, <strong>YouTube</strong> took a decisive step: The company <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/24/technology/youtube-under-pressure-over-election-falsehoods-suspends-oan-for-covid-19-misinformation.html">suspended</a> the right-wing conspiracy factory <strong>One America News</strong>, demonetized its channel, and declared that it was not an ‚Äúauthoritative‚Äù source. It was the correct call: OAN has a <em>lengthy</em> record of spewing dangerous lies about everything from Covid to the 2020 election. At the time, YouTube insisted it had a responsibility to protect its users from corrosive disinformation, and noted that OAN had repeatedly violated its misinformation policies.</p>
<p>Now, less than five years later, <strong>Google</strong> boss <strong>Sundar Pichai </strong>and YouTube chief<strong> Neal Mohan </strong>have executed a shameless, whiplash-inducing reversal. On Wednesday, <strong>YouTube TV</strong> and OAN proudly announced that they had <a href="https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/us-politics/one-america-news-youtube-deal-b2815177.html">inked a carriage deal</a>, catapulting the channel onto one of the country‚Äôs largest digital pay-TV platform. In effect, Google tossed a lifeline to the outlet, since most every other major carrier in the country had booted it from its lineup. The move will make YouTube TV among the biggest distributors of the <strong>MAGA</strong> propaganda outlet in America.</p>
<p>And YouTube isn‚Äôt even pretending to be embarrassed. In fact, just the opposite. <strong>Justin Connolly</strong>, YouTube‚Äôs global head of media, raved about the deal‚Ä¶</p>

<p><strong><em>Vilifying the Vulnerable:</em></strong> ‚ÄúAGAIN: TRANS SHOOTS UP MINNEAPOLIS CATHOLIC SCHOOL.‚Äù That was the banner splashed across <strong>Breitbart‚Äôs</strong> homepage Wednesday evening, a reflection of the <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/maga-takes-sick-victory-lap-over-trans-minneapolis-shooter-robin-westman/">anti-trans narrative</a> flowing through right-wing media after a shooter opened fire on <strong>Catholic</strong> school children during mass. Much of the coverage was fixated on the shooter‚Äôs gender identity, casting trans people as inherently dangerous. Indeed, the goal seemed to be to take the suspect's heinous actions and weaponize them into an indictment of an entire community. <strong>Elon Musk</strong>, the father of a transgender daughter, also piled on, declaring ‚Äúthere is a clear pattern here.‚Äù <strong>Minneapolis</strong> Mayor <strong>Jacob Frey</strong> pushed back directly at that framing. ‚ÄúAnybody who is using this‚Ä¶ as an opportunity to villainize our trans community, or any other community out there, has lost their sense of common humanity,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe should not be operating out of a place of hate for anyone.‚Äù</p>
<ul><li><p><strong>Trey Gowdy</strong> stunned<strong> Fox News</strong> viewers with a call for stronger gun laws after the horrific shooting, saying its time for ‚Äúa conversation of freedom versus protecting children‚Äù and noting, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs always a young white male, almost always.‚Äù [<a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trey-gowdy-minnesota-gun-control_n_68af8c7fe4b0bbcc3f8dde42?ncid=NEWSSTAND0001">HuffPost</a>]</p></li><li><p><strong>Brian Lowry </strong>penned an excellent piece: "<strong>Donald Trump </strong>looks terrible.
