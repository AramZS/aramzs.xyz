<p>The UK Department for Science, Innovation and Technology is run by Peter Kyle MP, who knows nothing about science or technology and brags that he <a href="https://pivot-to-ai.com/2025/03/13/foi-reveals-uk-science-secretary-peter-kyle-cribs-chatgpt-for-advice/">cribs from ChatGPT</a> to do his job. The Department also <a href="https://pivot-to-ai.com/2025/05/30/the-uk-will-totally-replace-two-thirds-of-junior-civil-servants-with-ai-chatbots-says-the-chatbot/">uses chatbots to write official reports</a> on how chatbots will totally let them fire all the civil servants.</p>
<p>Here’s a new report from DSIT: “Commercial offensive cyber capabilities: red team subsector focus.” In computer security testing, the “red team” attacks and the “blue team” defends: [<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/commercial-offensive-cyber-capabilities/commercial-offensive-cyber-capabilities-red-team-subsector-focus"><i>gov.uk</i></a>]</p>
<blockquote><p>the commercial red teams, who simulate threat actor attacks on clients using similar tools, tactics, methods and procedures. This report therefore is a reflection on how this segment of the sector is integrating and adapting their business models to emerging technologies.</p></blockquote>
<p>“Emerging technologies” means flashy garbage the current government hopes will be a miracle solution to them having no ideas. So, AI.</p>
<p>The main relevance of AI to security is scammers using chatbot-generated text to do social engineering attacks and deepfake video and audio for phishing attacks.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the security guys just aren’t on-message with DSIT on the vast and unspeakable benefits of AI. Because they’re trying to get real work done.</p>
<p>Security companies do look into large language models because their clients are “influenced by AI marketing claims.” But:</p>
<blockquote><p>Quantification of the benefits of AI were debated as the cost savings benefits have yet to be realised and require significant initial capital investment.</p> <p>… “I think it’s been shoehorned into products to make them seem better than it is.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The security guys aren’t interested in quantum computing either. Because it doesn’t exist yet. The report’s author seems surprised that “several interviewees believe that quantum computing is in an overhyped phase.”</p>
<p>It gets even better. Dig this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Some of the more surprising results was the lack of discussion around technologies such as blockchain or cryptocurrencies.</p></blockquote>
<p>Blockchains. Why is this report even mentioning blockchains? Who cares about <a href="https://davidgerard.co.uk/blockchain/business-bafflegab-but-on-the-blockchain/">enterprise blockchain</a> in 2025?</p>
<blockquote><p>The benefits of blockchain for decentralisation, immutable transactions, resiliency and transparency when it comes to data management, makes its lack of discussion in the sector from interviewees surprising.</p></blockquote>
<p>Surprising? To who? People who have no idea what they’re talking about? I dunno, you think maybe it’s possible that blockchain doesn’t do any of those things in practice? That maybe companies that actually do things never found it useful?</p>
<p>And maybe the people who keep saying blockchain does do anything are approximately 100% a bunch of coiners trying to pump their bags? Now, that might remind you of AI.</p>
<p>The blockchain section of this extremely mediocre report reads like it was written by a coiner trying to wodge a bit of crypto into an unrelated report any way they could.</p>
<p>The report was written for DSIT by Prism Infosec. So it’s pretty clear that everyone at Prism needs to officially disclose their crypto holdings.</p>
<p>This is an official government report that’s right there on gov.uk. Now, you might get the impression that every single person involved in writing and publishing this report was some sort of clown.</p>
