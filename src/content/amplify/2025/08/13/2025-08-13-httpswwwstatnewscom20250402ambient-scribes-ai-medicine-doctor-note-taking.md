  Christine Henneberg argues that every doctor is a writer, even if their
  writing is often focused on strict medical guidelines. She reflects on her
  early experiences in medical school, where writing was essential but not
  always creative. Henneberg warns that relying on AI for note-taking may cost
  physicians an important aspect of their communication and meaning-making in
  medicine.

<p>Henneberg is a practicing physician and a writer.</p>
<p>Every doctor is a writer, or that’s what I used to believe. From the first days of medical school, my classmates and I learned how to write, albeit for a particular purpose and according to strict rules — a type of writing that wasn’t necessarily beautiful, or even particularly interesting. But it was writing.</p>
<p>I still have some of those earnest attempts from my first year:</p>
<p><em>Ms. T was once a regular attendee at her church, but she now limits her time outside of the home because she can’t be away from her oxygen tank for more than a few hours. (She has portable O2, but doesn’t know how to use it.)</em></p>
