<p>At the annual meeting of the American Medical Association’s House of Delegates in June, the mood was tense. Hundreds of physicians had congregated in Chicago to vote on the organizations’ key policies. The AMA is the largest professional association for physicians, as well as a political lobbying group with a strong, if waning, presence on Capitol Hill.</p>
<p>As the Trump administration had begun embracing policies that diverged from medical consensus and conflicted with AMA policies, the group had employed a behind-the-scenes battle <a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/opinion/second-opinions/115596">strategy</a>, honing in on closed-door discussions with lawmakers as the place to push for sound science, evidence-based medicine, physician autonomy, and higher payments. But AMA members were now worried that this strategy, sometimes referred to as “quiet advocacy,” was not working.</p>
<p>Within days of his inauguration, President Trump had signed executive orders targeting <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/01/30/trump-executive-orders-pressure-universities-to-end-dei-programs/">diversity initiatives</a>, the <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/01/23/trump-executive-order-only-two-sexes-not-supported-by-science/">fundamental science of sex</a>, and <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/05/assessing-impact-trump-executive-order-gender-affirming-care-under-19/">gender-affirming care</a> for youth. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a long-time vaccine critic, had been <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/13/rfk-jr-confirmed-hhs-secretary-vote-vaccine-critic-to-top-trump-health-official/">confirmed</a> as the country’s health secretary with the key vote of Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), a physician. And major <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/14/house-budget-proposal-health-care-policy-impact/">cuts to Medicaid</a> funding were on the table in the budget reconciliation process.</p>
<p>Publicly, the AMA said nothing — even as members “begged” leadership at the organization to act more forcefully, according to Laurie Lapp, an OB/GYN resident who served on an AMA council that reviews and makes recommendations on proposed federal legislation.</p>
<p>But in recent weeks there’s been a change in tone, with the AMA issuing a slew of public statements critical of decisions made by the administration. STAT interviews with half a dozen members of the organization as well as its leadership shed light on what led the organization to bring its advocacy work out of the shadows.</p>
<p>A crucial turning point came on the fourth day of the House of Delegates meeting, when news broke that Kennedy had disbanded the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and intended to replace them with hand-picked vaccine skeptics. The AMA leadership reflexively issued a statement that many delegates saw as weak. “We all wanted to see action,” one attendee told STAT.</p>
