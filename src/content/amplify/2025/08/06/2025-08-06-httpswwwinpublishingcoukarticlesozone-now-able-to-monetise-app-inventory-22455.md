<p>The announcement comes as Ozone’s new Always-On Measurement methodology has shown publishers achieving consistent, total revenue uplift of up to 21% through the platform, says <a href="https://www.ozoneproject.com/">Ozone</a>.</p>
<p>The launch of Ozone’s app capability will make it easier for Ozone publishers to generate more value from their audiences. With the introduction of the app SDK, publishers will be able to apply Ozone’s Smart Bidstream technology to their app inventory as part of a growing multi-channel monetisation solution.</p>
<p>This latest development for Ozone’s publishers comes alongside the business formally launching its new Always-On Measurement capability. This allows publishers to independently quantify the incremental impact of Ozone’s publisher technology across their total programmatic business. Already live across the majority of Ozone’s publishers, this methodology has shown significant revenue uplift of between 12% and 21% across their total programmatic business. When compared to generic header-bidding, the underlying proprietary technology captures over 80% more bid responses, with more than double the aggregate value from buyers, claims Ozone.</p>
<p>Built in collaboration with their partners, Ozone’s technology is helping publishers across the world to regain greater control over their first-party data assets, inventory and distribution. This publisher-built technology, designed to be independent of third-party identifiers, is already having a major impact on non-cookie traffic, increasing publisher revenues by 40%. According to Ozone, this infrastructure is well positioned to generate sustained revenue growth for publishers even after Chrome's upcoming deprecation of third-party cookies.</p>
<p>This latest announcement represents the first in a series of strategic initiatives that Ozone will introduce to publishers in the upcoming months.</p>
<p>Danny Spears, Chief Operating Officer, Ozone said, “We’re excited to officially launch these new capabilities for our publisher partners, specifically designed to help them create more value from the premium web. These initiatives reinforce our collective, and unwavering, commitment to ensuring premium publishers have greater control over both their inventory and data assets. With the digital advertising world set for another period of change next year, we’re ready and primed to help publishers across the world build a more sustainable future for reader-first, digital journalism.”</p>
