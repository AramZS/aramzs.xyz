<p>Hundreds of people attended the West Tisbury Farmers’ Market this week to show support for the pierogi vendor who refused to sell dumplings to prominent attorney Alan Dershowitz at the market last week.</p>
<p>Just a few minutes into the start of the market Wednesday, located on the Agricultural Hall grounds, a large line formed at Good Pierogi. The stand <a href="https://vineyardgazette.com/news/2025/07/31/dershowitz-takes-issue-farmers-market-after-pierogi-denial">denied Mr. Dershowitz a half dozen pierogi last Wednesday</a>, garnering headlines in the national press and condemnation from Mr. Dershowitz.</p>

<p>“A big thing that we do every summer is to come out and support the West Tisbury Farmers’ Market, and after everything going on with Good Pierogi, we really want to show our support for the Island and support them,” said Emily Carito as she waited in line. “They are the best pierogies on the Island.”</p>
<p>The afternoon prior, Good Pierogi chef and co-owner Krem Miskevich released a statement on Instagram directly addressing the incident with Mr. Dershowitz that took place on July 30.</p>
<p>Miskevich said that they decided to not sell pierogi to Mr. Dershowitz because of his conscious decision to befriend and defend men who have been accused of abusing and harming women. Mr. Dershowitz, a longtime seasonal Chilmark resident known for taking on controversial clients, has represented Harvey Weinstein, Jeffrey Epstein, OJ Simpson and President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>In their statement, Miskevich said that their food is a labor of love, and selling to Mr. Dershowitz would be the equivalent of supporting his decisions and statements.</p>
<p>“I have no desire to argue about the legal system in the U.S., or one’s right to a fair trial,” Miskevich wrote. “But, I personally know too many sexual abuse survivors.”</p>

<p>After being refused pierogi last week, Mr. Dershowitz raised the potential of a lawsuit and called on the farmers’ market to only allow vendors who will sell to all customers.</p>
<p>Mr. Dershowitz, who is Jewish and often wears a shirt that reads “Proud American Zionist” at the market, was at the Agricultural Hall grounds on Saturday for the market, and, according to Miskevich, was handing out flyers that claimed the chef was an antisemite. During an airing of Mr. Dershowitz’s podcast, Mr. Dershowitz also said he believed he was denied pierogis because of his support for Israel.</p>
<p>In their post, Miskevich articulated that they are Jewish, have personal relationships with both Rabbis on-Island, and stand against those who harm or seek to harm others, as well as those who would defend them.</p>
<p>Mr. Dershowitz made another stop at the market on Wednesday, the day that Good Pierogi is present, and attempted to again get an order of dumplings. He argued that nobody, regardless of their beliefs or identity, is to be denied service.</p>
<p>“I predicted that there would be a very long line because much of Martha’s Vineyard is very anti-Israel and if he [they] had refused to sell to a non-binary person or a transgender person there would not be a single person on line, but he [they] refused to sell to a Zionist and everybody supports that,” Mr. Dershowitz said in an interview with the Gazette on Wednesday at the market.</p>
<p>“If the farmers market doesn’t change its rules, then the issue will be determined by the courts,” he continued.</p>
<p>Crowds migrated toward the perimeters of the Good Pierogi booth as Mr. Dershowitz took his place in line with the book The Ten Big Anti-Israel Lies. He had brought the book to give to Miskevich, and had inscribed a note reading “please learn the truth.”</p>
<p>Miskevich, their spouse Lily Rose and worker Talia Weingarten, respectfully did not accept the book.</p>

<p>“This is not a cross examination, this is a conversation,” Ms. Weingarten said to Mr. Dershowitz, evoking cheers from the crowd. “My Jewish culture is a history of resistance against genocide, we are not antisemites, we stand against oppression of all people,” she continued.</p>
<p>As the conversation continued, people surrounding the tent began to chant “time to go” at Mr. Dershowitz.</p>
<p>Ethan Buchanan-Valenti, manager of the West Tisbury Farmers’ Market, stepped in and said Good Pierogi had asked him to intervene and, after assessment of the situation, requested Mr. Dershowitz to take the conversation off the premises.</p>
<p>After the crowds dissipated and Mr. Dershowitz exited pierogiless, Mr. Buchanan-Valenti said his plan for the day had always been to maintain a business-as-usual approach.</p>
<p>“I let my vendor know that if they were feeling uncomfortable, to reach out to me, and that’s what I’m here for,” he said.</p>
<figure><a data-cbox-img-attrs='{"title": "Alan Dershowitz enjoyed a juice, but went home pierogiless.

<p>The farmers’ market did send out a statement Tuesday saying the market’s board had reviewed its internal bylaws after last week’s incident. The market informed both the vendor and Mr. Dershowitz that their responses were inappropriate and both parties were asked to refrain from doing the same in the future.</p>
<p>“The West Tisbury Farmers’ Market is not and should not become a place for political discourse, hurtful accusations, or harassment,” the market said in the statement.</p>
<p>Some protestors did show up at the market Wednesday, carrying signs, cutout heads of Donald Trump and Jeffrey Epstein and body cameras.</p>
<p>Protestor Rod Webber said he was there to support the pierogi stand and fight against the actions of Mr. Dershowitz.</p>
<p>“I think what Alan has been doing is bullying of the worst order and trying to turn it into a grandstand to keep himself relevant and to keep himself in the media, when the reality is that the people here on Martha’s Vineyard, the people at Harvard, the people in all aspects of his life have shunned him,” Mr. Webber said.</p>

<p>Mr. Webber and another protestor confronted the attorney, asking questions about Mr. Epstein. Security intervened in response to Mr. Dershowitz’s request for more space.</p>
<p>After the ordeal, Mr. Buchanan-Valenti took the day’s events in stride, noting that the businesses at the market were having a banner day.</p>
<p>“All of my vendors have ridiculous business, so that’s what’s making me happy,” he said.</p>
