<p>The Trump administration has moved forward with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/28/us/politics/trump-unions-executive-order.html">a plan to end collective bargaining with federal unions across a swath of government agencies</a>, even after arguing in federal court that it would not do so until a legal battle over an order President Trump signed was over.</p>
<p>The Department of Veterans Affairs said on Wednesday that it had moved to strip labor protections for more than 400,000 of its workers — most of whom are represented by the American Federation of Government Employees, the largest union for federal employees.</p>
<p><a href="https://news.va.gov/press-room/va-terminates-union-contracts-for-most-bargaining-unit-employees/">The department’s announcement</a> included attacks on union activities and leadership, and Doug Collins, the head of the agency, argued in a statement that the “unions that represent V.A. employees fight against the best interests of veterans while protecting and rewarding bad workers.”</p>
<p>Everett Kelley, the president of the A.F.G.E., said in a statement that the V.A.’s decision was “another clear example of retaliation” against unions that have opposed Mr. Trump’s plans to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/20/business/economy/government-union-trump-musk.html">slash the federal bureaucracy.</a> Mr. Kelley accused Mr. Collins of choosing to “rip up the negotiated union contract” of the majority of his work force.</p>
<p>A federal appeals court on Friday had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/01/us/politics/collective-bargaining-ninth-circuit.html">approved Mr. Trump’s order</a> instructing agencies to end collective bargaining agreements — part of a sweeping effort to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/10/us/politics/trumps-politicized-federal-work-force.html">assert more control over the federal work force</a>.</p>
<p>But the three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which allowed the order to proceed, did so in part because the Trump administration had directed agencies not to move ahead with the plan until the court battle was resolved. Because of that instruction, the judges wrote, there was a lower risk of harm to the unions and their members.</p>
<p>Two of the judges on the panel were appointed by Mr. Trump, and the other by President Barack Obama.</p>
<p>With few exceptions, union employees at the Department of Veterans Affairs have now lost the rights and protections provided by <a href="https://afgenvac.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2023-AFGE-Master-Agreement-1.pdf">a 308-page collective bargaining agreement</a> between the agency and the federal employees union. Those include the right to have work disputes resolved by a neutral arbitrator, and to have union stewards and leaders be granted official time on the job to work on cases and participate in contract negotiations.</p>
<p>The announcement by the Department of Veterans Affairs came as a shock to Eric L. Pines, a lawyer representing several local union branches for federal employees, including some V.A. workers. As the agency announced the contract terminations on Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Pines was working on legal cases for V.A. employees he was representing.</p>
<p>“That’s how shocking this is, to everyone involved — the agency, too,” said Mr. Pines, who found out about the action when contacted by The New York Times. “The agency was making arguments to the arbitrator as if they still had to make arguments to the arbitrator.”</p>
<p>Mr. Trump had framed his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/28/us/politics/trump-unions-executive-order.html">order stripping federal workers of labor protections</a> as critical for protecting national security. But a group of affected unions argued in court that the order was a form of retaliation against unions that have participated in a barrage of lawsuits opposing Mr. Trump’s policies.</p>
<p>The unions had also argued that the order broadly targeted agencies across the government, some of which had no obvious national security portfolio — including the Department of Health and Human Services and the Environmental Protection Agency — using national security as a pretext to strip the unions of their power.</p>
