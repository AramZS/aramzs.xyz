<p>Like all the movie studios, Disney is extremely into its live-action remakes of cartoons, ’cos god forbid they do something original. They’re doing a live-action version of the 2016 film <em>Moana</em>, starring Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson back in his role as the demigod Maui.</p>
<p>Disney couldn’t get Johnson for all the filming days they’d need him. So they were going to get in Johnson’s equally large cousin Tanoai Reed as a body double, then AI-face-swap Johnson’s face onto Reed.</p>
<p>Johnson signed off on this plan — but it fell at the Disney lawyers. Specifically, they worried that AI-generated images might not be entirely copyrightable. So none of the AI-tweaked Johnson footage will be in the release version. [<a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/media/disney-ai-hollywood-movies-5982a925"><i>WSJ</i></a>]</p>
<p>Face-swapping has been done for years without issues. But the US Copyright Office has ruled that purely AI-generated images don’t get a copyright in the US. And not owning every twitch of every asset on the screen is something Disney is actively worried about:</p>
<blockquote><p>Studios fear a future in which they don’t own every element of a finished film, and no studio attorney wants to be the one to unwittingly let that happen.</p> <p>… Disney employees who want to feed corporate information into generative AI tools for company business must first seek approval from an AI committee.</p></blockquote>
<p>Disney is currently suing <a href="https://pivot-to-ai.com/2025/06/12/disney-sues-ai-image-generator-midjourney/">AI image site Midjourney</a> over letting people generate copies of Disney characters. And the writers and actors unions are still very pissed off about all the AI stuff, and Disney doesn’t want to mess up the next round of negotiations.</p>
<p>The Disney executives are still convinced that AI is “inevitable.” Because they really want it to be.</p>
<p>The execs were wowed by impressive demos of video generators like Google’s Veo 3, which <a href="https://pivot-to-ai.com/2025/07/05/google-veo-3-fails-week-3-fail-harder-with-a-vengeance/">do not in fact work for any more than 7-second snippets</a>. But the Disney execs never bothered learning anything about film, so they were flabbergasted:</p>
<blockquote><p>At Disney’s annual management retreat in Orlando earlier this year, Rob Bredow, a senior vice president at Disney’s Lucasfilm, gave a presentation showing the rapid advances of generative AI tools, some of which can generate images and scenes that, to the casual eye, appear as good as professional productions.</p></blockquote>
<p>“To the casual eye” is doing 110% of the work in that sentence.</p>
<p>Disney was also worried about the “fan backlash.” They were going to use generative AI for the new Tron movie, “Tron: Ares.” The movie is about an AI-generated soldier who enters the real world. They thought having an AI-generated character, a sidekick called Bit, might be a “buzzy marketing strategy”.</p>
<p>But as well as the writers’ and actors’ unions making a fuss, “executives internally were told that the company couldn’t risk the bad publicity.”</p>
<p>Now that’s really good news — they’re <i>worried</i> about the backlash against AI.</p>
<p>You know what this means, right? Bullying the promptfondlers works! Bullying the corporations works! Bully them harder!</p>
