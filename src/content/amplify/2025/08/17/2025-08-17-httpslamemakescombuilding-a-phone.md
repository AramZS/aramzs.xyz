title: I'm Building a Phone
---
<p>For a couple years I've flirted with the idea of making my own phone. It started as a joke, but has become a real area of design, research and experimentation for me.</p>
<h2>Why?</h2>
<p><strong>Privacy</strong> - Everything about the mobile phone reveals all kinds of data on it's user. To name a few weak points: <a href="https://www.404media.co/dhs-says-china-russia-iran-and-israel-are-spying-on-people-in-us-with-ss7/?ref=lamemakes.com">Cell networks are built on inherently insecure protocols</a>, <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/08/inside-fog-data-science-secretive-company-selling-mass-surveillance-local-police?ref=lamemakes.com">apps sending third parties your sensitive information to be sold to cops</a>, and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/att-data-breach-was-i-affected-f0dda2b1d266a6068ffc607afd94b779?ref=lamemakes.com">mobile carriers often leaking call/text records</a>. An open sourced, privacy focused device would allow the user a better understanding of where their data is going and more granular control over it.</p>
<p><strong>Disconnection</strong> - Despite being someone who considers themselves pretty disconnected, I find my smartphone to be <em>exhausting</em>. I'm constantly battling the urge to check it, either refreshing my email or popping onto Instagram and/or Mastodon to scroll when my mind is idle. During the pandemic I made a hard effort to get a dumb flip phone but found it difficult due to the depreciation of 3G networks in the US. The flip phones that were still being manufactured seemed to mostly be running a flavor of Android, which brought me back to the privacy point.</p>
<p><strong>Education</strong> - I personally know very little about mobile networks and how they operate, along with RF based hardware/PCB design. This project is going to allow me to interface with lots of new concepts &amp; technology that I previously wouldn't have!</p>
<h2>Long Term Project Goals</h2>
<p>This is going to be a long term effort as I handle the complexity of the project along with the learning curve. Some big things that'd be cool to accomplish:</p>
<ul> <li>Building of a low-cost and easy to re-create development platform for mobile networks</li> <li>Making a fun, hackable mobile phone with some interesting capabilities</li> <li>Documenting and sharing my learnings along the way for others to pick up and build on</li> </ul>
<p>Being realistic about the scope of this project, I'm pretty content if I realize it isn't feasible and drop it after a while. As it stands, I'm pretty excited about it moving forward though.</p>
<h2>SIM7600 Breakout Board v0.1</h2>
<p>The first step in getting this phone project rolling was creating a development board based around the SIMCom SIM7600 and graciously PCBWay offered to sponsor the fabrication of the PCBs (see below for more info)! The SIM7600 is a modem that can connect to 4G, send texts, utilize GPS and even make calls. The features of the <a href="https://github.com/lamemakes/SIM7600-breakout/releases/tag/v0.1?ref=lamemakes.com">v0.1</a> development board are:</p>
<ul> <li>All antennas (main, aux, GPS) are broken out into external U.FL antenna receptacles</li> <li>USB-C 2.0 receptacle for USB interfacing (not powering)</li> <li>Nano SIM card slot</li> <li>Headphone jack for listening to phone audio, on board mic for sending phone audio</li> <li>UART, I2C, &amp; SPI voltage shifter to allow for more devices to utilize with the SIM7600's 1.8V interfaces</li> <li>30 labeled pins spaced at 2.54mm/0.1in to allow for easy breadboard placing</li> <li>Indicator LEDs</li> </ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<p>This is very much just the beginning, I'm currently in the process of debugging the v0.1 breakout board and have started designing a v0.2 correcting issues as I find them. After this is functional using a Raspberry Pi for the brains, I'll likely start to look for embedded Linux solutions and repackaging the SIM7600 so it begins to take more of a phone form factor, along with maybe some old blackberry keyboards (?) and a display.</p>
<h2>PCBWay Review</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.pcbway.com/?ref=lamemakes.com">PCBWay</a> sponsored the PCB fabrication for this project with the agreement that I give an honest review afterwards. I can say once again that the quality of these boards was fantastic! All of the soldering was done by hand and when working with 0203 packages (only a few human hairs wide!) a quality made PCB is critical, especially with good plating. I found these PCBs to be a pleasure to work with. The only thing that could've been slightly improved was the silkscreen quality, but with how small my text was I realized issues were likely. Despite that the silkscreen text is still completely legible!</p>
<p>Very grateful to the wonderful folks at PCBWay for being a continuous supporter of these projects!</p>
