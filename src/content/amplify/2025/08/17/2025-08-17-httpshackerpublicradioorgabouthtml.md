<ul> <li><a href="https://hackerpublicradio.org/about.html#about">About HPR.</a></li> </ul>
<p>What differentiates HPR from other podcasts is that the shows are crowd sourced from the community - fellow listeners like <strong><a href="https://hackerpublicradio.org/about.html#contact">you</a></strong>. There is no restriction on how long the show can be, nor on the topic you can cover as long as they are not spam and <em>"are of interest to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_(hobbyist)">Hackers</a>"</em>. If you want to see what topics have been covered so far just have a look at our <a href="https://hackerpublicradio.org/eps/index.html">Archive</a>. We also allow for a <a href="https://hackerpublicradio.org/series/index.html">series</a> of shows so that hosts can go into more detail on a topic.</p>
<p>You can download/listen to the shows <a href="https://hackerpublicradio.org/eps/index.html">here</a> or you can <a href="https://hackerpublicradio.org/syndication.html">subscribe</a> to the show in your favorite podcatching client to automatically get our new shows as soon as they are available. You can copy and redistribute the shows for free provided you adhere to the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0) License</a>.</p>
<p>Hacker Public Radio (HPR) is an Internet Radio show (podcast) that releases shows every weekday Monday through Friday. HPR has a long lineage going back to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230323053905/http://www.oldskoolphreak.com/">Radio FreeK America</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220123174618/https://www.binrev.com/forums/">Binary Revolution Radio</a> &amp; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150208172826/http://www.nomicon.info/">Infonomicon</a>, and it is a rename of <a href="https://hackerpublicradio.org/twat.html">Today With a Techie</a> radio. Please listen to StankDawg's "<a href="https://hub.hackerpublicradio.org/ccdn.php?filename=/eps/hpr0001/hpr0001.mp3"> Introduction to HPR</a>" for more information.</p>
<p>Hacker Public Radio is dedicated to sharing knowledge. We do not accept donations so please consider supporting our patrons. If you listen to HPR, then we would love you to <a href="https://hackerpublicradio.org/contribute.html">contribute</a> one show a year. Our shows are by default released under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"> Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0)</a> license. All the software we use is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software">Free software</a>. All the code we develop is published in our <a href="https://repo.anhonesthost.net/explore/repos">GitTea</a> repository. All the media is available via the <a href="https://hackerpublicradio.org/syndication.html">feeds</a>.</p>
<p>HPR is entirely community driven. Policy decisions are proposed and discussed on the <a href="https://hackerpublicradio.org/maillist">Mailing list</a>, which is open to anyone to join. Mailing list discussions are brought to the attention of the listening community on the first Monday of the month in the <a href="https://hackerpublicradio.org/series/0047.html">HPR Community News</a> show. This show is also <a href="https://hackerpublicradio.org/recording.html#round_table">open to anyone</a> to participate in. The schedule for the Community News shows can be downloaded as an <a href="https://hackerpublicradio.org/HPR_Community_News_schedule.ics">iCal calendar</a> containing recording dates for the next 12 months. A reminder is also sent to the mailing list in the week before the recording.</p>
<p>Our hosting is kindly provided to us by <a href="https://hackerpublicradio.org/correspondents/0174.html">Josh Knapp</a> from <a href="https://anhonesthost.com/hosting/shared-hosting">AnHonestHost.com</a>, and he has the last word in issues related to site security. A changing team of volunteers called the "admins" or "Janitors", deal with the day to day operation of HPR. Acting as the first point of contact, processing the shows, coordinating policy discussions, removing spam, updating the website, etc. They are contactable via the email account admin @ HPR. They have no more say over policy than anyone else. Anyone who has shown a long term dedication to the project and is trusted by the community, can become an admin.</p>

<p>After you have selected a date you will be redirected to the <a href="https://hub.hackerpublicradio.org/request.php">request page</a>, where you will be asked to select your show and email address.

<p>Got any questions not covered here, then just email <strong>"admin" at "HPR"</strong>, and we'll get in touch with you with all you need to know about getting your show published.<br/>
 You can chat with other podcasters using IRC in the <strong>#oggcastplanet</strong> channel on the <a href="https://web.libera.chat/gamja/?channels=oggcastplanet">libera.chat</a> network. Follow us on <a href="https://infosec.exchange/@hpr">Mastodon</a> (use the tag <strong>#hpr</strong>) and on <a href="https://twitter.com/hpr">Twitter</a> (use the tag <strong>#hpr</strong>). We have a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/HenryPartickReilly">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/groups?mostPopular=&amp;gid=3737302">LinkedIn</a> group, so please join and spread the word.</p>
<p>Fellow listeners like yourself contribute the shows and so we all know how hard it is to do that first show. You're probably worried that we won't like the topic. Well don't be, have a look at our <a href="https://hackerpublicradio.org/eps/index.html">Archive</a> to see how diverse the contributions have been. You're probably worried about the quality of your audio, that you sound funny, that English isn't your native language, that you suffer from a speech impediment, that your show has loads of ummms and awws in it, well don't be. We have plenty of hosts that fall into all these categories but continue to produce great shows.</p>
<p>At the end of the day the show is about the content and not the quality of the audio. That's not to say we won't help you with ways to improve the audio if you wish, or narrate your script if you can't or won't record it yourself. Drop into the IRC channel <a href="https://web.libera.chat/gamja/?channels=oggcastplanet">#oggcastplanet</a> where there are people who will help.</p>

<p>This is some important information that you will need to know before uploading to HPR.</p>
<h2>You will no longer be allowed to edit HPR pages on Wikipedia <a href="https://hackerpublicradio.org/about.html#faq_wikipedia">.</a></h2>
<p>Once you upload a show, you will no longer be allowed to create or edit pages relating to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_Public_Radio">Hacker Public Radio</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:FAQ/Organizations">Wikipedia</a>.<br/>

<p>The community decides the HPR policies. Please join the <a href="https://hackerpublicradio.org/maillist">HPR Mailing List</a> to participate.</p>
<h2>HPR will stop as a project if there are not enough shows <a href="https://hackerpublicradio.org/about.html#no_shows_no_hpr">.</a></h2>
<p>Hacker Public Radio is dedicated to sharing knowledge. We release about 260 shows a year, which is probably more than all of the other FOSS podcasts put together. If you listen to HPR, then we would love you to <a href="https://hackerpublicradio.org/about.html#so_you_want_to_record_a_podcast">contribute</a> one show a year. Remember once that all the reserve shows have been used up and there are no more shows in the queue, HPR as a project will stop.</p>

There you can introduce the content and explain why it is important, providing links to where we can get more information etc., and then include one example episode.</p>

<h2>The audio of your show will not be moderated<a href="https://hackerpublicradio.org/about.html#not_moderated">.</a></h2>
<p>We do not vet, edit, moderate or in any way censor any of the audio you submit, we trust you to do that. Aside from checking snippets for audio quality/spam checking, we have a policy that we don't listen to the shows before they are aired. This is a long standing tradition arising from the fact that HPR is a community of peers who believe that any host has as much right to submit shows as any other. <br/>
 We <strong>do</strong> transcode the audio into different formats.</p>
<p>Please note that this only relates to the audio you upload. The rest of the meta-data (branding/summaries/tags/show notes/etc.), are managed by the HPR Community, and <strong>may</strong> be edited. The show <a href="https://hackerpublicradio.org/eps/hpr2210/index.html">hpr2210 :: On Freedom of Speech and Censorship</a> describes the agreed approach to this topic.</p>
<h2>Your show will be signaled as containing explicit content <a href="https://hackerpublicradio.org/about.html#explicit">.</a></h2>
<p>Given that we are an open forum for free speech we signal all our shows as "explicit" with the assumption that the listeners will apply the required discretion when playing the shows in public. That said the majority of our content is technical in nature and therefore is often considered appropriate for any audience. If you feel that your show will be considered <strong>inoffensive in every region of the world</strong> then you can signal that when you upload the show.</p>
<p>When dealing with content that is "explicit" or contains material that would best be suited for a mature audience, it has become traditional to include a short warning at the very beginning of the show before the intro, to allow listeners time to switch off the episode should they so desire.</p>

<h2>You determine when your show will be released<a href="https://hackerpublicradio.org/about.html#schedule">.</a></h2>
<p>The HPR Schedule is entirely community driven and we recommend that <strong>you</strong> pick the date or show number as then you know when your show will be released. However the slots will only be allocated once the shows have been successfully processed. Any missing information can result in a show missing the requested slot. Once the slots have been allocated it is not possible to move them.</p>
<h2>All reservations need to be approved<a href="https://hackerpublicradio.org/about.html#reserving">.</a></h2>
<p>Any host can select any free slot a up to year in advance. However the audio must be ready at time of picking a slot so that it can be upload immediately afterwards.</p>
<p>In exceptional circumstances it may be necessary to reserve a slot while not having the audio available, but this must be approved by the <a href="https://hackerpublicradio.org/maillist">HPR Mailing List</a> in advance. Be sure to allow as much time as possible, and include a reason why you feel it is necessary to reserve the slot.</p>
<p>This is intended only for exceptional circumstances, such as a scheduled interview where we would like the audio to be released as soon after the event as possible, or to cover an important topical situation that has occurred. Due to the extended time now needed to post shows to external sites, the extra work this entails and the disruptive effect of reservations, we will no longer be allowing them except in very rare cases of the type mentioned above.</p>
<p>The following are standing reservations:</p>
<ul> <li>Anniversary episodes.</li> <li>HPR Community News on the first Monday of the month.</li> <li>The first day of the fourth month.</li> <li>The days following new year.</li> </ul>
<h2>We use UTF-8 end to end<a href="https://hackerpublicradio.org/about.html#utf8">.</a></h2>
<blockquote>See the video "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MijmeoH9LT4">Characters, Symbols and the Unicode Miracle - Computerphile</a>" for an interesting background to ASCII and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8">UTF-8</a>. </blockquote>
<h2>Keep accessibility in mind<a href="https://hackerpublicradio.org/about.html#accessibility">.</a></h2>
<p>When you includes output from the command line in the show notes, posting screen-shots of console or terminal output makes it impossible for screen readers to access the text. Always try to include the raw output ( eg: embedded in &lt;pre&gt; tags) <br/>
 Include descriptive language in any link texts. <br/>
 Avoid structures like: <em>"For accessibility information click <a href="https://hackerpublicradio.org/about.html#accessibility">here</a>"</em><br/>
 Rather use: <em>"For more information click our <a href="https://hackerpublicradio.org/about.html#accessibility">accessibility page</a>"</em></p>
<h2>Your show will be heard by an International Audience <a href="https://hackerpublicradio.org/about.html#international">.</a></h2>
<p>We have people listening from all over the world, who may not have the same cultural background as yourself, therefore you should be as clear as possible when giving details. For example always give temperatures in both Celsius and Fahrenheit, measurements in Metric and Imperial, dates in <strong>YYYY-MM-DD</strong> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601">iso8601</a> format, and abbreviations using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_phonetic_alphabet">NATO phonetic alphabet</a>. Never assume that your audience knows what age a sixth grader is, or how big a 20 Cent Euro coin is. Keep in mind that keyboard layouts are also different so make sure to specify the key shape or the position inrelation to a common known standard. For example:</p>
<blockquote>The at sign normally situated above the 2 key on a US keyboard, and has a unicode number of U+0040. For more information see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_sign">Wikipedia</a></blockquote>
<p>The reserve queue is intended only to be used in the cases where there is still a gap in the schedule one week prior to release. This was known as the emergency queue, but now can also be used when the hosts don't care when the shows are scheduled. They will be used on a first come first go basis, when there is no conflict with the scheduling guidelines. These shows contain a message alerting listeners to the fact that we had free slots that were not filled.</p>
<ol> <li>You must have your audio recording ready to upload <strong>before</strong> you pick a slot.</li> <li>New hosts, Interviews, and other time critical shows should use the first free slot.</li> <li>Always try and fill any free slots that are available in the upcoming two weeks.</li> <li>When the queue is filling up then leave some slots free for new contributors.</li> <li>Post non urgent shows into the first empty week.</li> <li>If you are uploading a series of shows then post them one every two weeks.</li> <li>If you have a non urgent show that is timeless, then add it to the <a href="https://hackerpublicradio.org/about.html#reserve_queue">Reserve Queue</a>.</li> </ol>
<p>On this page you will find information on how to record a podcast. Our golden rule is <strong>Any audio is better than no audio.</strong> so keep that in mind. Don't forget to <strong>introduce yourself</strong> in your show.</p>
<p>Many of today's <a href="https://wiki.xiph.org/PortablePlayers">portable media players</a> support recording audio out of the box. Search for "Voice Recorder", to see if there is an application for your smartphone. Whichever option you have close to hand, try and set the recording to the best quality format (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WAV">WAV</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLAC">FLAC</a>), and set everything else to the highest setting. It's always the goal to get the best quality audio but here at Hacker Public Radio we value content over quality and so long as it's audible we'll take it.</p>
<p>Then just record your show, <a href="https://hackerpublicradio.org/about.html#requesting_slot">request a slot</a>, and we'll do the rest.</p>
<p>Some of our hosts recommend <a href="https://gitlab.com/axet/android-audio-recorder">Android Audio Recorder</a> on my android phone. It's available on <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.github.axet.audiorecorder/">F-Droid</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.github.axet.audiorecorder">Google Play</a>. These are the recommended settings:</p>
<ul> <li>Recording Source - Unprocessed</li> <li>Sample Rate - 44.1 kHz</li> <li>Encoding - .flac</li> <li>Audio Channels - Mono</li> </ul>
<h2>Recording/Editing using your Computer<a href="https://hackerpublicradio.org/about.html#editing">.</a></h2>
<p>The majority of podcasters use <a href="https://audacity.sourceforge.net/download/">Audacity</a>. First set the Project Rate to 44100Hz, then you can either record your show in Audacity itself or import the file you recorded earlier and edit it as you wish.</p>

<figure><div class="rw-embed-wrapper"><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ss8CyTwBOPY" type="video/mp4"/></div></figure>
<p>When you have finished editing your podcast you can export it.</p>
<ol> <li>Confirm that the Project Rate is set to 44100 Hz (bottom left).</li> <li><em>File -&gt; Export</em> and select <strong>FLAC File</strong>.</li> <li>Click <em>Options...</em> to reveal FLAC Export Setup.</li> <li>Set <em>Level</em> to <strong>8 (best)</strong>.</li> <li>Set <em>Bit depth</em> to <strong>24</strong>.</li> </ol>

<p>If you want to record a one-to-one interview with someone then you can use <a href="https://www.skype.com/en/">Skype</a> in conjunction with <a href="https://atdot.ch/scr/">Skype Call Recorder</a>. If everyone is using skype then it won't cost you anything otherwise you will need to pay for SkypeOut service. Although the quality is usually terrible, you could also put your phone on hands free and record with a <a href="https://wiki.xiph.org/PortablePlayers">portable media player</a>.</p>
<p>If you would like to record with multiple participants then you can use <a href="https://www.mumble.com/">Mumble</a>. Connect to <strong>chatter.skyehaven.net</strong> Port: <strong>64738 </strong>.<br/>
 Walk through the audio wizard and then pop into the <strong>Hacker Public Radio</strong> room. Once you are ready press the <strong>recording</strong> button, select <em>multichannel</em> and then <em>start</em>. That will record multiple tracks, one for each participant which you can edit and then submit. <br/>
 Kwisher made a <a href="https://hackerpublicradio.org/mumble-howto">Mumble tutorial</a> which you might find useful and <a href="https://hackerpublicradio.org/correspondents/0228.html">Delwin</a> has produced a number of short shows on how to configure the audio quality.</p>
<p>You may include backing music but it's best if you don't. Most long time podcast listeners speed up their shows, as this allows them to cram more shows into a day. Having bedding music makes it more difficult to understand, and prevents tools like <em>truncate silence</em> from working correctly.<br/>
 Others will convert shows to mono to listen in one ear leaving the other free to carry out their other chores. Still more slow the shows down so that they can improve their English. Others are hard of hearing and backing music makes it difficult to understand the text.</p>
<p>We will by default mix down your show to one channel mono and we will <a href="https://gitorious.org/hpr-scheduling-system/hpr-scheduling-system/source/2d526e000d31e79afa3d863ea8659503e2074267:transcoding/hprtranscode">transcode</a> to MP3, ogg and spx formats. If you want to control this in more detail then please email admin at Hacker Public Radio for more information.</p>
<h2>No need to add Metadata to the file<a href="https://hackerpublicradio.org/about.html#no_metadata">.</a></h2>

If you record a show of your own in which you introduce the other podcast, perhaps explaining why it is important, and giving links to the feed, you may include an example episode.</p></li> <li><p>A series exists <a href="https://hackerpublicradio.org/series/0075.html"><em>Podcast recommendations</em></a>, which can be used for such shows.</p></li> </ul> <h2 data-number="0.4">0.4 What defines a show as being "<em>Produced for Hacker Public Radio</em>"?</h2> <ul> <li>If you create material and post it first on HPR then it meets the requirements of "<em>being produced for HPR</em>". That means once you upload it to the HPR server you can publish it anywhere else you like.</li> </ul> <h2 data-number="0.5">0.5 What are the mandatory elements of an HPR show?</h2> <ul> <li><p>See <a href="https://hackerpublicradio.org/about.html#requesting_slot"><em>Picking a slot for your show</em></a> for the full details of how to submit a show and what information is required.</p></li> <li><p>A quick summary of the main components is:</p> <ul> <li>A show title</li> <li>A summary of what the show is about</li> <li>The <em>explicit</em>/<em>clean</em> flag</li> <li>License</li> <li>Show notes</li> <li>Tags</li> <li>Audio</li> </ul></li> </ul> <h2 data-number="0.6">0.6 What are tags?</h2> <ul> <li><p>We are trying to maintain a collection of tags to allow people to find shows on the same (or similar) topic.</p></li> <li><p>Tags are simple words or short phrases describing aspects of a show such as what topics are covered in it. To get hints about what tags have already been used you can view all the current tags in alphabetical order on this page: <a href="https://hackerpublicradio.org/tags.html">Tag summary</a></p></li> <li><p>Some examples are: <b>android</b>, <b>creative commons</b> and <b>gaming</b>.</p></li> <li><p>Are there any tags that are best avoided?</p></li> </ul> <h2 data-number="0.7">0.7 Is it OK if I don't include notes with my show?</h2> <ul> <li><strong>Please don't do that</strong>. It is important to provide good show notes for reasons described on the <a href="https://hackerpublicradio.org/about.html#requesting_slot"><em>Picking a slot for your show</em></a> page: <ul> <li>They provide the listeners with more information on the topic your show is covering</li> <li>They ensure your show gets posted on time (the volunteers don't have to make notes for you)</li> <li>They encourage people to download your show</li> <li>They allow your show to be indexed by search engines</li> <li>They make your show accessible to the deaf and hard of hearing</li> </ul></li> </ul> <h2 data-number="0.8">0.8 How do I include photographs or other files with my show?</h2> <ul> <li>TBA</li> </ul> <h2 data-number="0.9">0.9 What is and is not edited in a show after submission?</h2> <ul> <li><p>We don't listen to the audio before posting a show to the website, so we don't change the content.</p></li> <li><p>Unless you have done so and told us you have, we add an introduction to the audio announcing what it is. Similarly we add an <em>outro</em>. This is not <u>editing</u> since we don't change the content.</p></li> <li><p>We may make changes to the show title, summary or tags. Usually these are minor changes such as spelling corrections. The intention is not any sort of censorship, merely to make these items more understandable or easier to index.</p></li> <li><p>Depending on the form the show notes take we may modify these.</p> <ul> <li>If what is submitted is plain text we convert it to Markdown in order to generate HTML.</li> <li>If the notes are one of the permitted markup formats (mostly Markdown flavours) we may adjust this to ensure that valid HTML is generated.</li> <li>If the notes are HTML we run them through an HTML checker and correct any mistakes it highlights.</li> <li>We may correct spelling, grammar and punctuation if this clarifies anything which might otherwise be unclear.</li> <li>If despite the request for show notes of some kind, none are provided, we may add notes which help to clarify the content of the show. This may be done after the show is released (when we have had a chance to listen to it).</li> </ul></li> <li><p>We are working on the production of reports about any changes made, which will be sent to the host after we have processed the show.</p></li> <li><p>We may make changes to a show's metadata if the host requests it (see the item on <a href="https://hackerpublicradio.org/about.html#if-i-notice-an-error-in-my-shows-details-how-can-it-be-fixed"> fixing errors after upload</a>).</p></li> <li><p>If a show contains links to resources which disappear after a period of time, we may at some future time change the notes to refer to any <em>Wayback Machine</em> copy that can be found.</p></li> </ul> <h2 data-number="0.10">0.10 What are some common errors in show notes?</h2> <p>It depends on the note format to some extent:</p> <ul> <li><p>It's very easy to hand-write bad HTML. That's why we use an HTML checker on it, and fix the errors it reports.</p></li> <li><p>A common fault is to write <code>&lt;code&gt;&lt;pre&gt;</code> to define a pre-formatted block of text using a fixed-width font. However it's illegal because the <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> tag can't be enclosed in other tags like <code>&lt;code&gt;</code>. Use <code>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;</code> instead.</p></li> </ul> <ul> <li>This is quite a forgiving format. Some people embed HTML in the Markdown, and the HTML used suffers from some of the issues discussed in this document. These are <em>much</em> harder to spot. The HTML checker can't really help unless it's run on the output from Pandoc.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><p>Spelling is often an issue in notes. As the notes are processed they are edited in the Vim editor with the spell check option turned on. In most cases spelling problems flagged by Vim are corrected.</p></li> <li><p>Grammar and punctuation can also be issues. We do not have very effective grammar checking tools in the note preparation workflow. Modifications may be made to split up extra-long (often <em>comma-spliced</em>) sentences, rationalise the use of capital letters and similar.</p></li> </ul> <h2 data-number="0.11">0.11 If I notice an error in my show's details how can it be fixed?</h2> <ul> <li><p>The HPR administrators can make changes to show titles, summaries, notes and so forth. Ideally send an email to <code>admin</code> at <code>hackerpublicradio.org</code> explaining what the problem is and we'll fix it for you. We'll also ensure that the changes are propagated to the relevant page on archive.org.</p></li> <li><p>Don't be tempted to send in your corrections as a comment. Comments are not propagated to archive.org, so people referring to that copy will not see the changes.</p></li> </ul> <h2 data-number="0.12">0.12 Does <code>hobbypublicradio.com</code> have anything to do with HPR?</h2> <ul> <li><p>Some environments prevent access to sites which use the word <code>'hacker'</code> or <code>'hackers'</code> in their names (or content in extreme cases). The site names <code>hobbypublicradio.{com,net,org}</code> have been created, which link to the main HPR site, in order to get around this restriction.</p></li> <li><p>See the mailing list thread here: <a href="https://lists.hackerpublicradio.com/pipermail/hpr/2015-February/002493.html"> https://lists.hackerpublicradio.com/pipermail/hpr/2015-February/002493.html</a></p></li> </ul> <h2 data-number="0.13">0.13 How can I talk to other HPR hosts and listeners?</h2> <ul> <li>You have a number of choices: <ul> <li>The mailing list <a href="mailto:hpr@hackerpublicradio.org">hpr@hackerpublicradio.org</a> is where various policy matters are discussed and announcements made. You need to be a member of the list to post to it. Visit the <a href="https://hackerpublicradio.org/maillist"><em>listinfo page</em></a> to sign up.</li> <li>You can join the <strong>#oggcastplanet</strong> channel on IRC. Visit the <a href="http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=oggcastplanet">freenode.net</a> network to sign up.</li> <li>A number of HPR messages may be found on Twitter and <a href="https://infosec.exchange/@hpr">Mastodon</a>.</li> <li>An HPR tradition exists where we record a 26-hour show at the turn of the year celebrating the arrival of the New Year around the world. We use Mumble to record the show and anyone can connect to the Mumble server and speak to other HPR listeners and hosts. The recording is used to make multiple shows which are released when they are ready.</li> </ul></li> </ul> <h2 data-number="0.14">0.14 Why has HPR not got a Wikipedia page?</h2> <p> Once someone contributes to Hacker Public Radio, the Wikipedia rules prevent us from editing a page. You can of course create one prior to contributing a show, or ask for one to be created. </p> <p> We do of course believe that Hacker Public Radio should have a Wikipedia entry. We are one of the longest running podcasts having started as Today with a Techie on 2005-09-19. We also are unique in our community driven approach to producing shows. And of course the fact that Wikipedia itself references us as a source [<a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klaatu_(podcaster)">1</a>], [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Volkerding">2</a>], [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StankDawg">3</a>], [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summits_On_The_Air">4</a>], [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonas_%C3%96berg">5</a>] </p><h2 data-number="0.15">0.15 I'd like to post a show but I would rather not have my email address published on the site.?</h2> <p> The mail is just a way for us to get back to you if there was an issue posting the show. </p> <p> If you trust the janitors to know your real email we can just use an alias for you on the web site and have it forward the email to you automatically. That runs the risk that were the redirect list compromised then your real email would get exposed. </p> <p> If you prefer, we can use the janitor email for your shows with your own host id. Then if any emails come in we can manually forward them at some point. The risk is that you are trusting the janitors to protect your email but again it could be compromised. </p> <p> In both cases we would do our best to protect your email but we can't guarantee anything. </p> <p> The other option is to use an a throwaway email, like <a href="https://www.guerrillamail.com/">https://www.guerrillamail.com/</a> for your show. This will be up for enough time to get the key necessary for to post the show. However keep in mind that we will be very suspicious of any submission done this way and will be checking it in detail, so expect delays in processing. </p> </li></ul>
