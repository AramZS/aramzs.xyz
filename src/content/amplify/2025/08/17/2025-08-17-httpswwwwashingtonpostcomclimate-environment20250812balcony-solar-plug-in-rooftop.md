<p>Balcony solar promises to cut energy costs and grid reliance for renters and apartment-dwellers. I did a trial run at my home.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.nrel.gov/docs/fy24osti/87524.pdf">Fifty-three million</a> U.S. households cannot install rooftop solar, primarily due to building and roof limitations, because they live in apartments or because of their status as renters.</p>
<p>I’m one of them.</p>
<p>But as prices plummet and technology shrinks, soon almost anyone in the United States may be able to plug in to the sun. For a few hundred dollars, portable panels that hang on any sunny surface pump free solar electricity into your home via a wall socket.</p>
