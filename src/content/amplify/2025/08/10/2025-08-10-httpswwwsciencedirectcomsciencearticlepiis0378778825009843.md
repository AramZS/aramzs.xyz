<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>New strategies for assessing and improving indoor air quality, particularly in a manner reducing exposure to airborne pathogens, are required. Monitoring CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations within indoor spaces provides a relatively simple means of achieving this. We aimed to develop a simple approach to tracking CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations within a variety of indoor spaces, relating this to the number of occupants within the space, and then using the data to provide recommendations, improving the air quality within the space. Portable CO<sub>2</sub> monitors were used to collect data across an inner-city educational facility. Occupancy data was collected for each space using several methods and then data was processed to extract the steady-state CO<sub>2</sub> concentration for each space and level of occupancy. To allow clearer comparison between different spaces we calculated a parameter we term the ‘OC800’ or occupants per square meter before 800 ppm of CO<sub>2</sub> is exceeded. Of the 25 spaces studied, 12 were observed to exceed our desired CO<sub>2</sub> threshold of 800 ppm. For each space it was possible to determine the exact level of occupancy which would result in the CO<sub>2</sub> exceeding 800 ppm, allowing the assignment of occupancy limits to each space. If a higher level of occupancy was required, it was possible to calculate the relative increase in ventilation needed to achieve this. The average OC800 across the spaces was 0.3, with an OC800 below 0.2 appearing to indicate problematic spaces. This approach can be tailored to different locations and CO<sub>2</sub> thresholds, providing clear actionable solutions to poor indoor air quality.</p>
<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>Now more than ever, the importance of maintaining adequate ventilation to indoor spaces is recognised. With accepted evidence demonstrating the role played by ventilation in reducing the risk of airborne disease transmission [<a data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-id="b0005" data-xocs-content-type="reference" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778825009843#b0005">[1]</a>, <a data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-id="b0010" data-xocs-content-type="reference" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778825009843#b0010">[2]</a>, <a data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-id="b0015" data-xocs-content-type="reference" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778825009843#b0015">[3]</a>, <a data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-id="b0020" data-xocs-content-type="reference" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778825009843#b0020">[4]</a>], as well as exposure to various indoor pollutants [<a data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-id="b0025" data-xocs-content-type="reference" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778825009843#b0025">[5]</a>, <a data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-id="b0030" data-xocs-content-type="reference" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778825009843#b0030">[6]</a>, <a data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-id="b0035" data-xocs-content-type="reference" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778825009843#b0035">[7]</a>, <a data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-id="b0040" data-xocs-content-type="reference" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778825009843#b0040">[8]</a>]. However, whilst design guidelines for indoor ventilation do exist, with ASHRAE recently publishing standard 241 which has a specific focus on infectious aerosol, clear performance standards that can be used to assess whether or not a space is adequately ventilated do not exist [<a data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-id="b0045" data-xocs-content-type="reference" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778825009843#b0045">9</a>]. More widely established approaches to determining whether the air quality within a space is adequate and how many occupants a ventilation system can handle are required. Such methods are essential in maintaining a balance between the air quality requirements and energetic demands of a building.</p>
<p>Measuring indoor carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) concentrations represents a particularly promising method of testing indoor air quality, particularly as it relates to airborne infection risk. Being generated by the occupants of a space and removed when the air in a space is replaced by outside air, CO<sub>2</sub> can provide a good indication of the air exchange rate of a space relative to its occupancy. As CO<sub>2</sub> is generated by human activity, it is anticipated to be a good proxy for airborne infection risk, being assumed to correlate with concentrations of human generated airborne respiratory particles within a space (although recent evidence suggests this may not always be the case [<a data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-id="b0050" data-xocs-content-type="reference" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778825009843#b0050">10</a>]). Accurate CO<sub>2</sub> monitors can be obtained relatively cheaply, with several options being available to the general public. Additionally, it is becoming more commonplace for building management system linked CO<sub>2</sub> monitors to be incorporated into ventilation systems, often as a part of demand-controlled ventilation (DCV) systems, which can be an effective means of maintaining indoor air quality [<a data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-id="b0055" data-xocs-content-type="reference" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778825009843#b0055">11</a>] where their implementation is possible.</p>
<p>CO<sub>2</sub> monitoring as a research tool has been widely demonstrated to provide useful assessments of indoor air quality. Studies targeting school [<a data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-id="b0060" data-xocs-content-type="reference" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778825009843#b0060">[12]</a>, <a data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-id="b0065" data-xocs-content-type="reference" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778825009843#b0065">[13]</a>, <a data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-id="b0070" data-xocs-content-type="reference" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778825009843#b0070">[14]</a>] and office spaces [<a data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-id="b0075" data-xocs-content-type="reference" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778825009843#b0075">15</a>,<a data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-id="b0080" data-xocs-content-type="reference" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778825009843#b0080">16</a>] are common, but CO<sub>2</sub> monitoring has been conducted across almost every kind of indoor environment [<a data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-id="b0085" data-xocs-content-type="reference" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778825009843#b0085">17</a>,<a data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-id="b0100" data-xocs-content-type="reference" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778825009843#b0100">20</a>]. High CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations have demonstrated associations with high particulate matter (PM) in schools [<a data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-id="b0070" data-xocs-content-type="reference" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778825009843#b0070">14</a>], due to the resuspension of dust particles from occupants being a major source of PM in these settings. However, when outdoor PM concentrations are high, the opposite relationship may be seen, with particulate matter being transported into the building with the low CO<sub>2</sub> outside air [<a data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-id="b0105" data-xocs-content-type="reference" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778825009843#b0105">21</a>]. When CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations are high due to low ventilation rates (rather than excessive occupancy), the concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> has been demonstrated to correlate with other pollutants such as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) [<a data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-id="b0100" data-xocs-content-type="reference" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778825009843#b0100">20</a>] if those pollutants have an indoor source. Past monitoring studies have also aimed to correlate CO<sub>2</sub> levels with the results of physiological tests [<a data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-id="b0075" data-xocs-content-type="reference" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778825009843#b0075">15</a>], surveys regarding general discomfort [<a data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-id="b0090" data-xocs-content-type="reference" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778825009843#b0090">18</a>], and the amount of sick leave taken [<a data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-id="b0110" data-xocs-content-type="reference" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778825009843#b0110">22</a>] in an attempt to establish clearer relationships between CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations and health effects. However, while the research use of CO<sub>2</sub> monitoring is well established, approaches to using CO<sub>2</sub> outside of a research context, has seen less attention.</p>
<p>What initially seems to be the most obvious application of CO<sub>2</sub> monitoring, is as a method of tracking ventilation rates. Several approaches to using CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations to calculate the ventilation rate of an indoor space in terms of air changes per hour and volumetric flow have previously been published [<a data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-id="b0115" data-xocs-content-type="reference" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778825009843#b0115">23</a>]. However, these calculations are not trivial, often requiring the expertise of an engineer or air quality expert as well as the measurement of other variables such as the occupancy level, supply CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, and size of the space, depending on the method used. Additionally, various factors can lead to a breakdown in the assumptions upon which the calculations of ventilation rate from CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations are based. The CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations in the outdoor air supplied to a space show diurnal [<a data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-id="b0120" data-xocs-content-type="reference" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778825009843#b0120">24</a>] and seasonal [<a data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-id="b0125" data-xocs-content-type="reference" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778825009843#b0125">25</a>] variations, with the concentration being influenced by traffic emissions [<a data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-id="b0130" data-xocs-content-type="reference" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778825009843#b0130">26</a>] and photosynthetic activity. Additionally, a space may not only be ventilated by outdoor air, with air being brought from other parts of a building which already have elevated concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub>, or with air filtration systems being used that recirculate filtered air back into the space without removing the CO<sub>2</sub>. Finally, CO<sub>2</sub> monitoring may provide inconsistent results as a result spatial variations in the concentration, due to factors such as poor mixing and vertical concentration gradients, particularly when displacement ventilation is being used [<a data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-id="b0135" data-xocs-content-type="reference" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778825009843#b0135">27</a>]. Such issues complicate the establishment of clear relationships between indoor CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations, and ventilation rates. A more general use of CO<sub>2</sub> monitoring to improve indoor air quality, will require an approach not dependent on the calculation of ventilation rates.</p>
<p>Indoor CO<sub>2</sub> thresholds, these being defined points above which the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration is deemed unacceptably high, provide a simpler means of regulating indoor air quality and implementing ventilation performance standards, even in the absence of precise calculations of ventilation rate. Whilst various values have been suggested for indoor CO<sub>2</sub> thresholds [<a data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-id="b0140" data-xocs-content-type="reference" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778825009843#b0140">28</a>], consensus was reached across a relatively large group of air quality researchers with 800 ppm being suggested as a suitable threshold to differentiate poorly ventilated from adequately ventilated spaces [<a data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-id="b0145" data-xocs-content-type="reference" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778825009843#b0145">29</a>] based on evaluations of a classroom scenario ventilated entirely by outdoors air. In the proposed scenario, a threshold of 800 ppm was just above the calculated CO<sub>2</sub> steady state concentration reached in a classroom occupied by 25 students, ventilated at a rate of 14 L per second per person (in accordance with ASHRAE standard 241), resulting in a calculated infection risk probability of 2.9 %, maintaining the event reproduction value below 1 (see Part 6 of the SI for an expanded description of this). Further evidence for the appropriateness of an 800 ppm threshold came from SARS-CoV-2 airborne viability studies, which demonstrate that CO<sub>2</sub> has a direct effect on the airborne virus, neutralising the pH of airborne respiratory particles, thereby increasing the airborne viability of the virus within those droplets [<a data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-id="b0150" data-xocs-content-type="reference" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778825009843#b0150">[30]</a>, <a data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-id="b0155" data-xocs-content-type="reference" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778825009843#b0155">[31]</a>, <a data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-id="b0160" data-xocs-content-type="reference" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778825009843#b0160">[32]</a>]. Some evidence also suggests a similar mechanism will impact the airborne transmission of bacterial pathogens [<a data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-id="b0165" data-xocs-content-type="reference" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778825009843#b0165">33</a>]. Whilst the process by which CO<sub>2</sub> influences airborne pathogens is complex, the implication is relatively straightforward: there is now a rationale for the absolute value of CO<sub>2</sub> to be used directly as an indication of airborne infection risk, rather than it just inferring other factors leading to increased risk. In the SARS-CoV-2 study, 800 ppm was the lowest concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> demonstrated to increase the stability of the airborne virus, further cementing its appropriateness as a threshold to differentiate ‘good’ and ‘bad’ air quality. A final point of interest in reducing CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations comes from its reported influence on cognitive performance [<a data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-id="b0170" data-xocs-content-type="reference" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778825009843#b0170">34</a>], while this typically appears to require exceptionally high concentrations, one study on flight simulator performance suggested concentrations as low as 1500 ppm could have an impact [<a data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-id="b0175" data-xocs-content-type="reference" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778825009843#b0175">35</a>].</p>
<p>However, the exact CO<sub>2</sub> threshold used matters less than the process of actually applying the threshold. Key to using a CO<sub>2</sub> threshold approach to regulate indoor air quality is understanding the relationship between the level of occupancy and the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration within a space. If such a relationship is known, two options for maintaining the air quality within a space become available, either through altering the ventilation rate to the space or limiting the occupancy of the space. The aim of this work was to monitor the CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations and occupancy levels within a range of regularly occupied, mechanically ventilated indoor spaces and use the acquired data to develop a practical method for applying CO<sub>2</sub> a threshold (800 ppm in this case) to these spaces. A relatively simple method is proposed which facilitated the identification of spaces that did not meet the desired threshold, allowed diagnosis of the reason the space did not meet the threshold, and provided clear solutions for improving the spaces.</p>
<h2>2. Methods</h2>
<h3>2.1. Study overview</h3>
<p>The study took place within an educational facility in the Brisbane city centre. The spaces consisted of 25 rooms spread across 10 different buildings of varying ages and architectural styles which were all located within a campus that covered an area of approximately 450x240 metres. Of the spaces studied, 1 was a large lecture theatre, 2 were open plan office spaces, 8 were classrooms, and 14 were meeting rooms. All of the studied spaces had air supplied by some form of mechanical ventilation. Only one of the spaces (Office 1) had openable windows. Different approaches were applied to the study of different kinds of space. For office spaces, monitoring was only conducted for a few hours, as these spaces required the constant presence of a researcher. For classrooms and lecture theatres, the people leading the classes were given CO<sub>2</sub> monitors and asked to take it with them to the class to monitor the spaces whilst it was occupied. For meeting rooms, the monitors were placed in the meeting rooms for 4 consecutive days and then removed and the data retrieved. Excluding the data from the office spaces, the approaches used here captured data from 83 different meetings or classes. A summary of the spaces and meetings covered can be found in <a data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-id="t0005" data-xocs-content-type="reference" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778825009843#t0005">Table 1</a>.</p>

<h3>2.2. Aranet4 CO<sub>2</sub> monitors</h3>
<p>The Aranet4 home CO<sub>2</sub> monitor was used in this study. The Aranet4 measures CO<sub>2</sub> using a non-dispersive infrared sensor. The monitor also reports temperature, relative humidity, and atmospheric pressure, but these were not used in this study. The sensor reports a time and date stamped 1-minute average CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, which can be retrieved by Bluetooth connection to a smartphone app and downloaded as a.csv file.</p>
<h3>2.3. Placement of CO<sub>2</sub> monitors</h3>
<p>Efforts were made to place the monitors in positions that would provide fair comparisons between different spaces, with readings taken as close to the ‘breathing zone’ as possible. although practical limitations such as the available surfaces within the space also had to be considered. For meeting rooms, the monitors were placed on a table (typically at a height of approximately 1 m from the ground) away from the centre of the room, to limit interference by the occupants and away from any doors or windows. For the classrooms the monitor was kept on a desk by the teacher of the class. For the office spaces, several monitors were placed throughout the space. For office space 1, this placement is indicated in <a data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-id="f0010" data-xocs-content-type="reference" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778825009843#f0010">Fig. 2</a>C, for office space 2, the placement can be found in supplemental Fig. S1, in these spaces the monitors were placed on raised areas between the desks at a height of approximately 1.5 m above the ground.</p>
<h3>2.4. Occupancy monitoring</h3>
<p>Three different approaches were used to attain occupancy information, depending on the type of room being studied. For office spaces, the only available option was to have a researcher sit within the space for the entirety of the monitoring period and keep track of the occupancy manually. For classrooms (or classroom style meeting rooms) the person running the class was asked to note down the occupancy for each session and report it back to us. For meeting rooms, an information sheet was placed on the door, politely requesting meeting attendees to note down the occupancy, start time, and end time of the meeting. Whilst inspection of the CO<sub>2</sub> data indicated that several meetings occurred during the monitoring period for which no occupancy information was reported, meetings were only used in the study when occupancy information was provided. This approach depended on the accuracy of the self-reported data provided by the occupants. The appearance of any significant outliers may have indicated inaccurate occupancy reporting, no such occurrences were noted within this study.</p>
<h3>2.5. Additional space information</h3>
<p>Information regarding the floor area and the ventilation system for each space was accessed through the business’s building management system (BMS). One crucial piece of information that was not attainable through the BMS was the ceiling heights of the spaces, which was obtained manually using a tape measure. Additionally, the stated capacity for each space was obtained from the surveyed businesses meeting room booking system.</p>
<h3>2.6. Data analysis</h3>
<p>Initially, CO<sub>2</sub> data was analysed to determine the maximum CO<sub>2</sub> concentration reached during the occupied period. This was a manual process, with the highest concentration (not including any initial decrease occurring from a preceding higher level of occupancy) being visually observed and a 5-minute average taken. This point would usually be at the end of the meeting, where the room was closest to being in steady state. CO<sub>2</sub> data was then analysed to approximate the ventilation rates for the studied spaces and characterise the relationship between the number of occupants and the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration reached. See SI for a detailed description of the data analysis approach taken here.</p>
<h2>3. Results and Discussion</h2>
<h3>3.1. A threshold approach highlights potentially problematic spaces</h3>
<p>Identifying whether or not the CO<sub>2</sub> within a space exceeds a set threshold (in this case 800 ppm) provides the simplest approach to identifying spaces that are potentially problematic. <a data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-id="f0005" data-xocs-content-type="reference" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778825009843#f0005">Fig. 1</a> provides an overview of such an approach, showing the maximum 5-minute average [CO<sub>2</sub>] reached in each meeting monitored (excluding residual high CO<sub>2</sub> from preceding meetings).</p>

<p>During the monitoring period, 83 meetings (or classes) took place in the spaces shown in <a data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-id="f0005" data-xocs-content-type="reference" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778825009843#f0005">Fig. 1</a>, with 24 of these meetings (29 %) having the [CO<sub>2</sub>] exceed our threshold of 800 ppm. However, this approach was somewhat limited in its usefulness, as it provided no insights into possible causes of the high [CO<sub>2</sub>] and therefore no clear guidance on how to respond. In some cases, the issue was unlikely to be inadequate ventilation, but another problem. For example, in the case of the space labelled H314, inspection of the occupancy logs revealed that the occupancy capacity of the space was exceeded during the monitored meeting. For the space labelled P514 (which was a large lecture theatre), the ventilation was not turned on during the monitoring. Furthermore, this approach provides no quantitative assessment of the problem, meaning it cannot be used to provide clear guidance on the degree to which a space was problematic and how much the ventilation rate needed to be increased to address any issues. A more nuanced approach to studying [CO<sub>2</sub>] within a space was required.</p>
<h3>3.2. Obtaining the [CO<sub>2</sub>] versus occupancy relationship for a space</h3>
<p>For each space studied, a time series of CO<sub>2</sub> ppm with datapoints at 1-minute intervals was generated by the Aranet4 monitor. Using the information provided by the occupants, data relating to meetings with a known level of occupancy was extracted from the time series. This is illustrated in <a data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-id="f0010" data-xocs-content-type="reference" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778825009843#f0010">Fig. 2</a>A, with four examples being taken from the same meeting room at four different levels of occupancy. In these examples the CO<sub>2</sub> can be seen to equilibrate to a concentration proportional to the occupancy for each meeting (this is termed the steady state concentration or [CO<sub>2</sub>]<sub>SS</sub> and is calculated as described in the SI). In the example shown with 2 occupants, the meeting occurred immediately following a meeting with a higher level of occupancy, meaning the CO<sub>2</sub> level initially decreased rather than increasing. Once the meetings end, the CO<sub>2</sub> starts to fall back to the baseline level.</p>

Example CO<sub>2</sub> data. <strong>A</strong> CO<sub>2</sub> ppm time series for three different meetings (one for each level of occupancy) in the same space (room P825), with empty room data also being shown.

<p>The steady state concentration is a useful tool in comparing different spaces. For the space shown above, the steady state concentration versus occupancy is plotted showing a linear relationship (<a data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-id="f0010" data-xocs-content-type="reference" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778825009843#f0010">Fig. 2</a>B). For a given room volume and ventilation rate, this relationship will always be linear. The intercept of this regression indicates the average CO<sub>2</sub> concentration supplied to the room, and the slope is proportional to the ventilation rate and volume of the space. The use of the intercept to determine the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration being supplied to the space, means that no assumptions need to be used for this value.</p>
<h2>4. Obtaining the CO<sub>2</sub> versus occupancy relationship for office spaces</h2>
<p>Initially, monitoring CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations within a complex office space was explored (<a data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-id="f0015" data-xocs-content-type="reference" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778825009843#f0015">Fig. 3</a>). This space consisted of an 11.5 m by 8 m open plan office, with a kitchenette, and door opening onto a large balcony seating area. Air is supplied to the office via a single air handling unit (AHU), which then directs air to 4 variable air volume (VAV) systems that distribute air to different parts of the office. Also within in the space is a side office (512D), which shares the AHU with the rest of the office but is supplied by its own VAV. The space has several spatial divisions, with a tall (approximately 2.5 m high) stack of lockers between the main office and the kitchenette and a section of the office (labelled 512C) being partially walled off from the rest of the space (see <a data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-id="f0015" data-xocs-content-type="reference" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778825009843#f0015">Fig. 3</a>C for a floor plan of the space).</p>

<p>The complexity of monitoring such a space is demonstrated by the occupancy data, with a constant movement of people into and out of the space and between different VAV zones within the space (<a data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-id="f0015" data-xocs-content-type="reference" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778825009843#f0015">Fig. 3</a>B). This was such that, unlike for the meeting rooms and classrooms in <a data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-id="f0005" data-xocs-content-type="reference" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778825009843#f0005">Fig. 1</a>, <a data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-id="f0010" data-xocs-content-type="reference" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778825009843#f0010">Fig. 2</a>, the CO<sub>2</sub> levels in the office area rarely appeared to reach steady state (<a data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-id="f0015" data-xocs-content-type="reference" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778825009843#f0015">Fig. 3</a>A). Furthermore, whilst most of the CO<sub>2</sub> monitors appeared to show agreement, the monitor placed in VAV zone 4 demonstrated a completely different trend, suggesting that the air within this space did not mix with the rest of the office. An experiment was carried out in which a fan was placed in VAV zone 4, directing air from this space into the rest of the office (Fig. S2). Turning on the fan reduced the CO<sub>2</sub> levels in VAV zone 4, resulting in roughly equal CO<sub>2</sub> levels across the office, further illustrating that a lack of mixing was likely the issue. The 1-minute average CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations reported by the Aranet appear linearly positively correlated with the total number of occupants. However, removing VAV4 from the analysis or using a slope removal function to isolate the points at which the room appears to be at steady state did not seem to strengthen the correlation. There is a significant lag between changes in occupancy and shifts in the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, with it seeming to take approximately 30 min after a change in occupancy level before a change in the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration can be seen to occur. Changes in the occupancy level occurred during the monitoring every 12 min on average, likely meaning the room rarely reaches a true steady state concentration. Previous work has demonstrated the formation of a local cloud of elevated CO<sub>2</sub> concentration around stationary office workers [<a data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-id="b0180" data-xocs-content-type="reference" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778825009843#b0180">36</a>] which could have introduced further complications to these measurements.</p>
<p>It was decided that a different method was required for obtaining the relationship between the CO<sub>2</sub> level and occupancy for such spaces. After testing three different methods using simulated datasets (see part 5 of the SI), it was determined that the ‘Three-Point Fit’ provided the most accurate results. In this approach, the lowest [CO<sub>2</sub>] for the lowest level of occupancy, the median [CO<sub>2</sub>] at the median level of occupancy, and the highest [CO<sub>2</sub>] at the highest level of occupancy, are all assumed to be close to the true [CO<sub>2</sub>]<sub>ss</sub> concentrations for these levels of occupancy, and so a linear regression can be obtained using these three points. Examples of this approach are seen for the above-described office, labelled Office 1 (<a data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-id="f0015" data-xocs-content-type="reference" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778825009843#f0015">Fig. 3</a>D), and another office space monitored for a similar length of time, labelled Office 2 (<a data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-id="f0015" data-xocs-content-type="reference" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778825009843#f0015">Fig. 3</a>E). It should be noted that the assumption upon which this approach is based will break down if the room is never at its highest level of occupancy for long enough for the [CO<sub>2</sub>] to approach steady state. This could be the case here for Office 1, as the high point is sitting below the middle point, possibly because the space only contained 8 occupants for brief periods of the monitoring. If the space is monitored for long enough, something akin to the [CO<sub>2</sub>]<sub>ss</sub> vs occupancy regression shown in <a data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-id="f0010" data-xocs-content-type="reference" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778825009843#f0010">Fig. 2</a> should be attainable, but it should be treated with more caution than the regressions obtained from spaces where the occupancy is stable enough to observe the [CO<sub>2</sub>] plateau.</p>
<p>Meeting rooms rarely share the same complexities as open plan office spaces, tending be smaller, supplied by a single ventilation source, and occupied in set blocks of dense occupancy, interspersed with periods of emptiness. All of this facilitates the use of CO<sub>2</sub> monitoring to provide clearer insights into the air quality in the space. Furthermore, the acute airborne infection risk is likely much higher within meeting rooms than offices at many businesses, with higher concentrations of occupants, facing one another and frequently vocalising, in contrast to open plan office spaces which contain lower occupancy densities and are typically quieter. As such meeting rooms became the focus of much of this study.</p>
<h3>4.1. Using CO<sub>2</sub> thresholds to regulate the use of a space</h3>
<p>Once the linear relationship between the steady state CO<sub>2</sub> concentration reached and the number of occupants (an example of which is shown in <a data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-id="f0010" data-xocs-content-type="reference" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778825009843#f0010">Fig. 2</a>B) has been established, a simple approach to regulating the space becomes possible (<a data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-id="f0020" data-xocs-content-type="reference" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778825009843#f0020">Fig. 4</a>A). A maximum occupancy can be assigned to the space based on the chosen threshold (see supplementary information for more detail). We applied this to 9 spaces studied here, only selecting spaces for which it was possible to calculate the [CO<sub>2</sub>]<sub>ss</sub> for at least three different levels of occupancy, and compared the resulting occupancy limits to the capacity stated in the booking system for the meeting rooms (<a data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-id="f0020" data-xocs-content-type="reference" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778825009843#f0020">Fig. 4</a>B).</p>
<figure><img alt="" src="https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0378778825009843-gr4.jpg"/><ol><li><a href="https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0378778825009843-gr4_lrg.jpg">Download: Download high-res image (437KB)</a></li><li><a href="https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0378778825009843-gr4.jpg">Download: Download full-size image</a></li></ol><p>Fig. 4. Maximum Occupancy limits for the surveyed rooms. <strong>A</strong> Scatter plot of occupancy versus steady state CO<sub>2</sub> for an example space, demonstrating how the CO<sub>2</sub> defined occupancy limit is determined. <strong>B</strong> Bar plot of the capacity stated for each space by the businesses booking system in purple, and the CO<sub>2</sub> limited occupancy in blue as determined by the approach shown in 4A. <strong>C</strong> Occupants per square meter before 800 ppm is exceeded (OC800) values for different spaces. The OC800 is calculated for each space as the number of occupants per square meter before the 800 ppm CO<sub>2</sub> threshold is crossed. <strong>D</strong> Air changes per hour calculated for each space in purple with the ACH needed to give the spaces the stated capacity shown in blue, and the ACH needed for an OC800 of 0.5 shown in green. For <strong>B-D</strong> the red error bars come from recalculating upper and lower values for each parameter using the standard error of the slopes and intercepts of the linear regressions for each space. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)</p></figure>
<p>In this case the CO<sub>2</sub> limited occupancy was lower than the stated capacity for the space for all but two space (R305 and A311). The most problematic space appeared to be room O308, with the [CO<sub>2</sub>]<sub>SS</sub> likely to exceed 800 ppm at less than 7 occupants, despite the space having a stated capacity of 40 people. One approach to improving the air quality within these spaces could be to simply change the stated capacities for the spaces, to those that would maintain the CO<sub>2</sub> below the desired threshold. Other approaches could be used to define the occupancy limit. If the absolute value of CO<sub>2</sub> is not of concern, with interest only being to use CO<sub>2</sub> as an indication of ventilation rate, then the intercept of the linear regressions can be adjusted as desired, perhaps always being calculated using an assumed supply concentration of 450 ppm, to determine whether the space would exceed 800 ppm were it entirely supplied by outside air.</p>
<p>A useful metric to directly compare the CO<sub>2</sub> defined occupancy limits of different spaces is the occupants per square meter at which 800 ppm of CO<sub>2</sub> is likely to be exceeded (which we suggest terming the OC800 value). The OC800 value determined for these 9 rooms are shown in <a data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-id="f0020" data-xocs-content-type="reference" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778825009843#f0020">Fig. 4</a>C. The OC800 value provides a comparable metric for different spaces, evaluating the ventilation rates relative to the floor space available. Here room O308 is the standout again, appearing significantly lower than the other rooms. Comparing OC800 values to typical occupancy densities for the space type, such as those suggested in ASHRAE standard 62.1 (addendum p) provides a clear rationale for deciding whether a space is performing as designed. For meeting rooms, the density is expected to be 50 people per 100 m<sup>2</sup> (or 0.5 per m<sup>2</sup>) which is above the OC800 value for all of the above studied spaces. Two of the spaces (D304 and O308) were actually more akin to classrooms in their design, which are expected by ASHRAE to contain an even higher density of 0.65 people per m<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<h3>4.2. Using the approach to inform ventilation rate changes</h3>
<p>There are several previously published approaches to using CO<sub>2</sub> data to calculate ventilation rates [<a data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-id="b0115" data-xocs-content-type="reference" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778825009843#b0115">23</a>]. For this study the steady state concentrations were used, with the average ventilation rate in air changes per hour (ACH) being derived from the slope of the linear fit of occupancy versus [CO<sub>2</sub>]<sub>SS</sub> (see supplementary methods). Using this method, ventilation rates were calculated for the group of spaces shown in <a data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-id="f0020" data-xocs-content-type="reference" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778825009843#f0020">Fig. 4</a>D. Additionally, for each space the needed ventilation rate to allow the stated capacity for the space to be reached and to allow an occupancy of 0.5 people per m<sup>2</sup> were calculated. Variability in human CO<sub>2</sub> generation prohibits a precise measure of ventilation rate from CO<sub>2</sub> data alone, particularly when the age and activity level of the occupants is not known [<a data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-id="b0185" data-xocs-content-type="reference" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778825009843#b0185">37</a>]. However, it is still possible to determine the relative increases in ventilation rate required to achieve a particular level of occupancy. For example, in the case of R310 a doubling in the ACH is required to achieve an occupancy density of 0.5 people per m<sup>2</sup>, and so rather than asking engineers or a facilities management team to achieve a specific flow rate, they could simply be instructed to double the flow rate of the VAV supplying the space or install a second equivalent source of ventilation.</p>
<h3>4.3. Identifying faulty spaces – O308 example</h3>
<p>Several strategies were developed using this dataset to identify possible problems with spaces. In the first instance, the list of spaces that exceeded the desired threshold of 800 ppm (whilst below capacity and with the ventilation turned on), was reported to the facilities management team. Clearer information was able to be given based on <a data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-id="f0020" data-xocs-content-type="reference" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778825009843#f0020">Fig. 4</a>, with either occupancy limits or relative ventilation rate increases being determined for each space as options for improving them. However, for one space it was clear that there was a fault in the ventilation that could not be remedied by an increase in the VAV flow rate. O308 was the space with the largest discrepancy between its stated capacity and CO<sub>2</sub> limited occupancy and the calculated OC800 for O308 was notably smaller than the other studied spaces.</p>
<p>The plot of occupancy versus [CO<sub>2</sub>]<sub>SS</sub> for the space begins to highlight the problems (<a data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-id="f0025" data-xocs-content-type="reference" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778825009843#f0025">Fig. 5</a>A). Whilst the narrow range of occupancies covered by the monitoring limit the accuracy with which conclusions can be drawn from this data alone, it is apparent that the intercept and slopes are unusual for this space, with a small slope suggesting little impact of the occupants on the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration (which should indicate a high ventilation rate), but an exceptionally high intercept indicating that the supply CO<sub>2</sub> concentration is high. Whilst the CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations supplied to a space often exceed the 450 ppm value that would be expected if the space was only supplied by outside air, rarely does this value exceed 600 ppm. In this case the space was used as a classroom, and so monitoring was carried out by giving a CO<sub>2</sub> monitor to the teacher of the class and requesting that they record the occupancy. This approach prohibited the collection of empty room data, meaning the actual CO<sub>2</sub> levels for the empty space could not be recorded, however it is unlikely that the supply CO<sub>2</sub> concentration was as high as the intercept would suggest. The unusual slope and intercept could have just been a consequence of the limited range of occupancies covered. Alternatively, it was hypothesised that this was an example of a space where the ventilation rate responded to the occupancy, preventing any accurate occupancy vs CO<sub>2</sub> regression from being obtained. This suspicion was confirmed upon inspection of the BMS. This space was reported to contain CO<sub>2</sub> monitors within the return air for the ventilation system, which if the system was functioning correctly should trigger an increase in the supply of outside air to the space if the [CO<sub>2</sub>] exceeded 600 ppm (demand-controlled ventilation or DCV). Inspection of the time series data from the space (<a data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-id="f0025" data-xocs-content-type="reference" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778825009843#f0025">Fig. 5</a>B) demonstrates that this response to CO<sub>2</sub> does appear to be occurring, with periodic fluctuations of the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration taking place throughout the classes, appearing to indicate a variable ventilation rate (assuming the occupancy is remaining constant). However, rather than an increase in ventilation appearing to occur at 600 ppm, the threshold actually seems higher, perhaps being closer to 900 ppm. Furthermore, the increase in ventilation rate is not maintained, with the room seeming to return to the former ventilation level once the value falls to approximately 800 ppm. Whether this was responding to another threshold, or a timer function was unclear. The consequence is the [CO<sub>2</sub>] being maintained above 800 ppm regardless of the level of occupancy. These details were passed to the facilities management team, with the suggestion that either the CO<sub>2</sub> monitor or the BMS control system is not correctly calibrated. While it was the unusual nature of the occupancy vs [CO<sub>2</sub>]<sub>ss</sub> relationship that prompted a more detailed investigation into this space, it should be emphasised that the application of this approach to spaces with DCV is extremely limited. Using a linear regression <em>t</em>-test for the occupancy vs [CO<sub>2</sub>]<sub>ss</sub> regression obtained for a space, to determine whether the slope obtained for a space is significantly different to 0, provides a simple approach to determining whether the [CO<sub>2</sub>] within a space is responding to occupancy changes, and whether the approaches described this article can be used.</p>

<h3>4.4. Setting space tailored thresholds to identify future ventilation faults</h3>
<p>Once the relationship between occupancy and the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration is understood for a space, it becomes possible to use this relationship to identify future ventilation faults. However, this requires an understanding of the expected variability in the [CO<sub>2</sub>]<sub>SS</sub> for a given level of occupancy. We used our dataset to provide some parameters by which this variability can be understood (<a data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-id="f0030" data-xocs-content-type="reference" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778825009843#f0030">Fig. 6</a>).</p>

<p>For the set of spaces for which a relationship between occupancy and the [CO<sub>2</sub>]<sub>SS</sub> was established, the [CO<sub>2</sub>]<sub>SS</sub> concentration for each meeting was calculated as a fraction of the expected average [CO<sub>2</sub>]<sub>SS</sub> for that meeting’s level of occupancy (determined from the linear regression). The frequency distribution of these fractions is plotted in <a data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-id="f0030" data-xocs-content-type="reference" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778825009843#f0030">Fig. 6</a>A, with a bin width of 0.05. These values provide an insight into the expected variability of [CO<sub>2</sub>]<sub>SS</sub> at a given level of occupancy. Within our dataset there were no cases of the value deviating from the expected average by more than 20 %, allowing us to use this as an absolute threshold, with any case of the CO<sub>2</sub> exceeding the expected average by more than 20 % being a clear indication of a ventilation fault. The [CO<sub>2</sub>]<sub>ss</sub> data appears to be normally distributed. The distribution of the data was used to calculate an intermediate threshold, where a ventilation fault could be suspected. In our dataset, 20 % of the meetings exceeded the expected average [CO<sub>2</sub>]<sub>SS</sub> by 5–20 %, meaning this range of values should only be expected for an average of 1 in 5 meetings. Occupants or facilities managers could be warned that if they are seeing such values more regularly than this, there could be a ventilation fault.</p>
<p>In <a data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-id="f0030" data-xocs-content-type="reference" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778825009843#f0030">Fig. 6</a>B the expected variability is applied to the occupancy versus [CO<sub>2</sub>]<sub>ss</sub> relationship for meeting room P832. In this case it is assumed that the aim is to maintain the space’s current ventilation level and use occupancy specific thresholds to allow identification of problems in the space. By applying a traffic light system, with less than a 5 % fluctuation being no cause for concern, a 5–20 % increase being possible cause for concern, and more than a 20 % increase being a definite cause for concern, it is possible to calculate several thresholds for the space, for the expected levels of occupancy. Incorporating the above thresholds into building management systems could provide a practical means of alerting facilities management teams to any ventilation faults. However, doing so would require a reliable way of tracking the level of occupancy within the space. Informing occupants of these thresholds could ensure that an additional layer of scrutiny is applied to the space, potentially increasing accountability for building facilities management teams. Increased CO<sub>2</sub> concentration awareness of building occupants has been previously demonstrated to improve the air quality within student housing [<a data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-id="b0190" data-xocs-content-type="reference" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778825009843#b0190">38</a>]. These thresholds apply to the [CO<sub>2</sub>]<sub>ss</sub> averages but can be adjusted to relate to the 1-minute average concentration by incorporating the variability of whichever sensor is being used for monitoring.</p>
<h3>4.5. Limitations to the approach</h3>
<p>The approach reported here has several limitations. This methodology does not provide any means of predicting CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations within a space, before that space has first been characterised through a period of CO<sub>2</sub> monitoring. A clear relationship between the [CO<sub>2</sub>]<sub>SS</sub> and occupancy of a space is only attainable for spaces where the ventilation rate is relatively constant. Spaces like O308 which adjust ventilation rates based on the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration will not generate a linear relationship between [CO<sub>2</sub>]<sub>ss</sub> and occupancy, instead being expected to plateau whilst the occupancy is within the controllable range, with the [CO<sub>2</sub>]<sub>ss</sub> only beginning to proportionally increase with occupancy once the ventilation is operating at its limit. Spaces for which there are significant adjustments to the flow rate based on parameters less dependent on the occupancy, such as temperature, or that grant user control over the flow rate, will produce more variability in the [CO<sub>2</sub>]<sub>ss</sub> versus occupancy relationship, meaning more data will be required to generalise such spaces, limiting the application of this approach. Furthermore, the usefulness of applying this approach to any system which recirculates air that has been filtered of particles but not CO<sub>2</sub> is questionable, with the only form of ventilation observable in these datasets being those that replace air in the space with air containing a lower CO<sub>2</sub> concentration (and is filtered of outdoor particles). However, it should again be emphasised that recent publications indicate the concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> plays a direct role in modulating infection risk [<a data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-id="b0150" data-xocs-content-type="reference" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778825009843#b0150">30</a>], perhaps suggesting a need to revisit the application of approaches that recirculate particle-filtered high CO<sub>2</sub> air.</p>
<p>The reliance on steady state concentrations presents further limitations to this approach, particularly if spaces are not occupied for long enough for steady state to be reached. For the spaces studied here the average time to reach the steady state concentration was approximately 25 min, with no spaces requiring longer than 35 min (Table S2). Given that the average meeting length in the spaces was longer than 1 h, it was rare that the [CO<sub>2</sub>]<sub>ss</sub> was unattainable for a meeting. However, this may not be the case in every location, particularly for large or poorly ventilated spaces. Fluctuations in the supply [CO<sub>2</sub>] could also present issues, with diurnal variation, seasonal variation, and the introduction of CO<sub>2</sub> from other occupied areas of the building all having an impact. However, in this study the supply [CO<sub>2</sub>] varied less that the [CO<sub>2</sub>]<sub>ss</sub> with almost all values falling within 10 % of the mean for each space and more than half of the values being within 5 %. Whilst a consistent rise in outdoor [CO<sub>2</sub>] levels of 20–80 ppm is typical at nighttime, and was readily observable for Brisbane, the concentrations are more stable during working hours, meaning for this study such variation had little effect. Seasonal variation in outdoor CO<sub>2</sub> is typically very subtle only causing fluctuations of around 5 ppm, which are unlikely to be of consequence to the approach reported here.</p>
<p>Finally, with every space in this study being mechanically ventilated, this approach remains untested on naturally ventilated spaces, which are particularly commonplace in Australian schools [<a data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-id="b0060" data-xocs-content-type="reference" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778825009843#b0060">12</a>]. These spaces may require a different approach, with the opening and closing of windows, and poor mixing possibly preventing the spaces from reaching steady state. However, particularly in the case of school classrooms, the regular extended periods of dense occupancy, coupled with readily attainable occupancy data (in the form of class registers) should facilitate an occupancy versus [CO<sub>2</sub>]<sub>ss</sub> based approach. Sufficient quantities of data would be required to overcome the inherent variability of the spaces, but once a linear relationship is established for a space, OC800 values could be calculated to provide a simple rating system allowing a comparison between spaces, and CO<sub>2</sub> limited occupancies could be assigned to help better regulate the use of the spaces. Some success has been demonstrated, applying a mathematical approach to determine ventilation rates from classroom collected CO<sub>2</sub> data even with limited information regarding other parameters [<a data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-id="b0195" data-xocs-content-type="reference" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778825009843#b0195">39</a>], but this approach is complex and still unable to fully account for the spatial heterogeneity that occurs between classrooms.</p>
<h2>5. Conclusions</h2>
<p>Based on our experiences using CO<sub>2</sub> thresholds to explore air quality, we recommend it be made a more widespread approach, following the guidelines we set out in <a data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-id="tb1" data-xocs-content-type="reference" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778825009843#tb1">Box 1</a>. Using CO<sub>2</sub> defined metrics for ventilation and air quality, simplifies the process of improving and maintaining the air quality within a space, circumventing the complexities associated with determining the ventilation rate of a space in terms of ACH or volumetric flow per person. Additionally, CO<sub>2</sub> thresholds can be used to establish clear performance standards, allowing determination of whether the air quality within a space is adequate and the ventilation system is continuing to operate as designed.</p>
<p>Box 1</p>
<p>. A Practical Approach.</p>
<p>A set of guidelines have been developed based on the findings of this paper. These guidelines are intended to be applied to already operational spaces, rather than during the initial design/construction phase of a building.</p>
<p><u>Monitor Indoor CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations.</u></p>
<ul><li>The monitoring of CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations indoors should become routine, particularly for densely occupied spaces such as meeting rooms.</li><li>If possible, indoor CO<sub>2</sub> monitors should be linked to a BMS with the data continuously logged.</li></ul>
<p><u>Obtain an occupancy vs CO<sub>2</sub> relationship.</u></p>
<ul><li>If sufficient expertise and personnel are available, occupancy linked CO<sub>2</sub> data can be collected and processed using the same methodology published here.</li><li>If detailed CO<sub>2</sub> data processing is not possible, recording the maximum concentration reached for a given level of occupancy should be sufficient.</li><li>A simpler but less detailed approach may be to only record the occupancy when the desired CO<sub>2</sub> threshold is exceeded.</li></ul>
<p><u>Limit the occupancy of the space.</u></p>
<ul><li>When the relationship between occupancy and CO<sub>2</sub> is known, occupancy limitations can be assigned as described in this publication.</li><li>If occupancy is only recorded when a CO<sub>2</sub> threshold is exceeded, then the capacity for a space may be gradually reduced each time the threshold is exceeded.</li></ul>
<p><u>Calculate the OC800 for each space.</u></p>
<ul><li>The OC800 allows for easy comparison of different spaces. In our study well ventilated spaces had an OC800 above 0.3, while poorer spaces had an OC800 below 0.2.</li></ul>
<p><u>Adjust the ventilation of the space.</u></p>
<ul><li>If a higher OC800 or level of occupancy is desired for a space, then the ventilation must be increased. The increase required can be calculated as described in this paper.</li></ul>
<p><u>Track ventilation performance.</u></p>
<ul><li>Once the above steps have been carried out, continued tracking of the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration within the space is vital. If the CO<sub>2</sub> frequently exceeds the assigned threshold while below the occupancy capacity, then it should be checked for faults.</li></ul>
<p>During this study it was observed that a key barrier to the use of CO<sub>2</sub> thresholds was the lack of actionable information they provide. A space that exceeds the desired threshold can be identified as problematic, but more understanding of the space was required to provide solutions to the problem. Establishing a detailed understanding of the relationship between the occupancy and CO<sub>2</sub> concentration of spaces, provided the needed information to decide whether excessive occupant density or insufficient ventilation supply were causing a space to exceed the threshold. It was then possible to precisely quantify how much of an occupancy reduction or ventilation increase would resolve the problem. With the building managers being able to decide which course of action was most appropriate and economically viable. Another barrier to the use of CO<sub>2</sub> monitoring comes in the form of the variability inherent to many spaces. However, with a long enough period of monitoring, the occupancy regression can resolve these issues, with the linear regression being used to determine the ‘mean’ conditions for the space, with the variability observable as the scatter of data around this average. Unusual situations, such as ventilation faults, or changes to the typical use of the space, can be identified as outliers in the usual spread of data, alerting the appropriate personnel to carry out further investigation. While in our study a single CO<sub>2</sub> threshold was used across all of the spaces, the occupancy regression approach could also facilitate the use of space tailored thresholds as suggested in Persily 2022 [<a data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-id="b0200" data-xocs-content-type="reference" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778825009843#b0200">40</a>], with each space’s threshold being used to set its occupancy limit. The final barrier to the application of CO<sub>2</sub> thresholds came from spaces with regularly shifting occupancy, which prevented the [CO<sub>2</sub>]<sub>ss</sub> from being observed. This was resolved using the ‘Three-point fit’ approach, which provides an approach to deriving ventilation rates and occupancy limits for even these more complex spaces.</p>
<p>It is difficult to overstate the improvements that could be made to this approach with the introduction of automated and precise occupancy monitoring systems to spaces being studied. Large scale CO<sub>2</sub> monitoring for public spaces is now relatively affordable, with a commercially available sensor network costing 10 K AUD in 2021 [<a data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-id="b0205" data-xocs-content-type="reference" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778825009843#b0205">41</a>], but similarly large-scale occupancy monitoring remains challenging. Whilst we utilised three different approaches to attaining occupancy linked CO<sub>2</sub> data for this study, these approaches were tedious and, particularly in the case of office spaces, consumed considerable researcher time. This all served to limit the quantity of data that could be collected, and therefore the number of spaces and level of detail that could be covered. If ethical and privacy concerns can be appropriately accounted for, AI driven methods, thermal imaging, wi-fi connection data, or any of the other automated occupancy monitoring approaches could facilitate the collection of larger, more powerful datasets, providing clearer insights into the air quality of even complex spaces.</p>
