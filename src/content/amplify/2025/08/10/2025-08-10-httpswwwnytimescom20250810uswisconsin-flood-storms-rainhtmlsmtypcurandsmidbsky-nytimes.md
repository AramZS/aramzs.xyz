<p>Record-setting rains in Wisconsin led to life-threatening flash flooding in Milwaukee and the surrounding area overnight Saturday to Sunday, prompting widespread flood alerts and the early closure of the Wisconsin State Fair.</p>
<p>The Milwaukee area received 7.96 inches of rain from Saturday afternoon to Sunday morning, setting a record for a two-day rainfall total in the Milwaukee area, according to the National Weather Service.</p>
<p>More heavy rain was still to come on Sunday, forecasters said, and flood warnings remained in effect across Wisconsin.</p>
<p>At the Wisconsin State Fair in West Allis, Wis., organizers canceled an appearance by the band Lynyrd Skynyrd on Saturday night <a href="https://wistatefair.com/fair/lynyrd-skynyrd/">because of severe weather</a> and closed the fairgrounds early.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.tmj4.com/news/milwaukee-county/flash-flooding-forces-wisconsin-state-fair-to-close-early">Videos posted on social media and on local news sites</a> showed cars at the fairgrounds partly submerged on Saturday night. The fair <a href="https://wistatefair.com/fair/updates/">will remain closed on Sunday</a>, officials said, the final day of its 11-day run.</p>

<p>In a statement, the Milwaukee County Office of Emergency Management said on Sunday that it had not yet been able to tally all of its calls for service or to compile a complete damage assessment.</p>
<p>There were no immediate reports of deaths or injuries connected to the flooding.</p>
<p>Widespread power outages, flooding and road closures affected at least 19 municipalities across the county, Cassandra Libal, the agency director, said in an email.</p>
<p>Reports of water rescues and <a href="https://x.com/WaukCoEM/status/1954438038227955979">stranded motorists</a> began overnight on Saturday as creeks overflowed, with many spilling across roadways. Communities across the state braced for more rain through the weekend.</p>
<p>The continued rain will exacerbate “the ongoing flooding, and prolongs the standing water on roads,” Sarah Marquardt, a forecaster with the National Weather Service in Milwaukee, said on Sunday.</p>
<p>The heaviest rainfall came on Saturday, Ms. Marquardt said, but periods of rain will continue through Sunday and Monday.</p>
