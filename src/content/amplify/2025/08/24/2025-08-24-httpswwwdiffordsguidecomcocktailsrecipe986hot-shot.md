<h2>History:</h2>
<p>Created in 1987 by Bosse Bergström, a Swedish bartender for a coffee drink competition held in Stockholm. Following the competition, his drink became popular across Sweden and beyond. In the late 1990s, I remember the packaging for Galliano bottles sold in my London shop including a Hot Shot glass and spoon to aid layering of the ingredients. At parties in Sweden, it was commonplace for guests to chant "hot shot, hot shot, hot shot!"</p>
<p>The Hot Shot has proven enduring in Sweden, so much so that it has its own 'national day', celebrated on the third Friday of November.</p>
