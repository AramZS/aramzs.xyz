<p>The head of the biggest gaming site in the world is leaving the company at the end of August, <em>Kotaku</em> has learned. John Davison, who has been <em>IGN</em>‘s publisher since joining back in 2019, told staff on Monday it was time for “the next chapter.” The high-profile departure comes shortly after a big round of layoffs that saw multiple departments across the company impacted.</p>
<p>Arriving just months before the start of the 2020 pandemic, Davison’s tenure at <em>IGN</em> saw the site expand into events like <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/xbox-and-sega-among-publishers-appearing-at-ign-live">IGN Live</a> and a market analytics platform called <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ign-launches-gaming-trends-platform-shedding-light-on-how-mobile-roblox-and-more-are-reshaping-the-industry">Gaming Trends</a>. Under parent-company Ziff Davis, <em>IGN</em> also made a massive acquisition last year in the form of the Gamer Network, a suite of European-facing gaming sites like <em>Eurogamer</em>, <em>VG247</em>, and <em>Rock Paper Shotgun</em>. Many of those sites were hit with mass layoffs at the time of the deal, and <em>GamesIndustry.biz</em> was gutted. One of the most valuable parts of that package, <em>Digital Foundry</em>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/digital-foundry-df-direct-ign-patreon-retro-games-media-2000616308">announced just last week</a> that it had purchased all outstanding equity to allow it to leave<em> IGN</em> and go fully independent.</p>
<p>Davison, whose 25+ years in games media include stints at <em>EGM</em>, <em>Official PlayStation Magazine</em>, and <em>GameSpot</em>, will be leaving<em> IGN</em> at a time when its future trajectory has never been more uncertain. A reporting, news, and features operation that expanded under previous EIC Tina Amini has suffered cuts in recent years due to multiple rounds of layoffs and buyouts. Amini, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ign-editor-in-chief-tina-amini-steps-down">who left in 2022 and now works at Xbox</a>, was never replaced. Davison reported to Ziff Davis president of gaming and entertainment Yael Prough, and it’s not yet clear if the parent company plans on backfilling his role.</p>
<p>Davison and <em>IGN</em> did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p><em>IGN</em> laid off over a dozen staff earlier this month, which included approximately 12 percent members in its editorial union. “The company has told us that the reason for this layoff stems from a Ziff Davis mandate to cut costs despite several quarters in a row of year-over-year revenue increases, to which IGN Entertainment responded by coming for our members’ jobs,” <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ignunion.bsky.social/post/3lvm4rhup5k2a">the IGN Creators Guild wrote at the time</a>. “This is perplexing to us, as we are told again and again that IGN Entertainment has had a tremendously successful year thus far thanks to their hard work.”</p>
<p>“It’s been an honor to work alongside such talented, passionate people, and I’m deeply proud of what we’ve accomplished together,” Davison wrote in a message to staff today. “I’m excited for what comes next.”</p>
