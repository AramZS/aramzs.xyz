title: The computer science dream has become a nightmare
---
<p>The coding-equals-prosperity promise has officially collapsed.</p>
<p>Fresh computer science graduates are facing unemployment rates of 6.1% to 7.5% — more than double what biology and art history majors are experiencing, according to a recent Federal Reserve Bank of New York <a href="https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/college-labor-market#--:explore:outcomes-by-major">study</a>. A crushing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/10/technology/coding-ai-jobs-students.html">New York Times piece</a> highlights what’s happening on the ground.</p>
<p>The individual stories are surreal. Manasi Mishra, 21, graduated from Purdue after being promised six-figure starting salaries, only to receive a single interview, at Chipotle (she didn’t get the job.) Zach Taylor has applied to nearly 6,000 tech jobs since graduating from Oregon State in 2023, landing just 13 interviews and zero offers. He was even rejected by McDonald’s for “lack of experience.”</p>
<p>The alleged culprits? AI programming tools that are eliminating junior positions, while big names like Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft slash jobs. Students say they’re trapped in an “AI doom loop” — using AI to mass-apply while companies use AI to auto-reject them, sometimes within minutes.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Mishra landed a job after a cold application worked out, helped along by some savvy <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@khuhlina/video/7512111098317819182">TikTok posts</a> about the borked job market.</p>
