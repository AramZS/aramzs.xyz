  We introduce ExtremeBB, a textual database of over 53.5M posts made by 38.5k

  users on 12 extremist bulletin board forums promoting online hate, harassment,

  the manosphere and other forms of extremism. It enables large-scale analyses
  of

  qualitative and quantitative historical trends going back two decades:

  measuring hate speech and toxicity; tracing the evolution of different strands

  of extremist ideology; tracking the relationships between online subcultures,

  extremist behaviours, and real-world violence; and monitoring extremist

  communities in near real time. This can shed light not only on the spread of

  problematic ideologies but also the effectiveness of interventions. ExtremeBB

  comes with a robust ethical data-sharing regime that allows us to share data

  with academics worldwide. Since 2020, access has been granted to 49 licensees

  in 16 research groups from 12 institutions.
