  Why Trump’s threat to deploy the National Guard tests D.C.’s home rule - The
  Washington Post

<p>The president also placed city police under federal control.</p>
<p>President Donald Trump said Monday he would deploy the National Guard to D.C. streets and place the District’s police under direct federal control, a dramatic use of federal power that Trump says is part of a crusade against crime in the nation’s capital.</p>
<p>His decision comes after a week of his escalating threats, ignited by the brutal beating of a former DOGE employee <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/08/05/trump-doge-worker-washington-dc-crime/">in an attempted carjacking</a> in Northwest Washington this month. The crime reinspired the president’s criticisms of local leaders, who have few options to stave off federal encroachment.</p>
