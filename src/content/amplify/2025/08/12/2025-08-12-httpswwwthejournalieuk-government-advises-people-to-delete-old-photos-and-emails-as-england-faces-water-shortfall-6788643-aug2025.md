<p>The UK government has urged people to delete old pictures and emails as ‘data centres require vast amounts of water to cool their systems’.</p>
<p>THE UK GOVERNMENT has advised people to delete old pictures and emails amid a “nationally significant” water shortfall in England.</p>
<p>Five areas in England are officially in drought, with six more experiencing prolonged dry weather.</p>
<p>Despite unsettled weather last month, many river flows and reservoir levels in England have continued to recede and the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/national-drought-group-meets-to-address-nationally-significant-water-shortfall">National Drought Group has said that rainstorms and showers “helped mask the fact that July was still the fifth warmest on record</a>”.</p>
<p>As of the end of July, England has had its driest six-month spell since 1976 and August has seen the fourth heatwave of the summer, putting more pressure on public water supplies.</p>
<p>There appears to be no or little let-up in the dry conditions for some areas in the coming days, according to the UK Met Office.</p>
<p>Water restrictions have been put in place across some areas of England and the National Drought Group has thanked the public for following restrictions where they are in place.</p>

<p>Its chair, Helen Wakeham, added that “simple, everyday choices – such as turning off a tap or deleting old emails – also really helps the collective effort to reduce demand”.</p>
<p>As well as deleting old emails, the National Drought Group has urged people to delete old pictures as well as “data centres require vast amounts of water to cool their systems”.</p>
<p>Dr Venkatesh Uddameri, a Texas-based expert in water resources management, recently told the BBC that a typical data centre can use between 11 million and 19 million litres of water per day, roughly the same as a town of 30,000 to 50,000 people.</p>
<p>In addition to deleting old photos and emails, the National Drought Group advises people to fix leaking toilets, as these can waste up to 400 litres a day, avoid watering lawns, turn off taps when brushing teeth, and take shorter showers.</p>
<p>The UK’s National Drought Group includes the Met Office, regulators, government, and water companies.</p>
<p>Chief Meteorologist at the Met Office, Dr Will Lang, noted that temperatures are getting towards the mid-30s for some in the south of England.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, over £700 million (€810m) has been committed by water companies to tackle leaks over the next five years.</p>
<p>The UK’s Environment Agency is conducting more compliance checks on businesses and ensuring water companies follow their drought plans.</p>
