<p>The Sierra Club’s board of directors Monday voted to oust the group’s executive director, Ben Jealous.</p>
<p>The group’s board “has unanimously voted to terminate Mr. Jealous’ employment with the Sierra Club for cause following extensive evaluation of his conduct,” Sierra Club spokesperson Jonathon Berman said Monday in an email.</p>
<p>“The Sierra Club values all of its employees, members, and volunteers, not just those holding influence and power. The Sierra Club will continue to look into concerns raised regarding misconduct irrespective of who they are raised against in furtherance of our policies, the law, and our mission,” Berman added.</p>
<p>The board’s vote follows the group’s cryptic announcement in July that Jealous was on leave following his two tumultuous years leading the environmental nonprofit.</p>
<p>The group’s leadership informed staff in July that Loren Blackford would be serving as interim executive director while Jealous was on leave. The group did not offer details about the cause of the leave or how long it would last.</p>
<p>His ouster follows several turbulent years at the group.</p>
<p>Jealous oversaw multiple rounds of layoffs during his tenure as the Sierra Club’s leader and openly feuded with the group’s staff.</p>
<p>Patrick Murphy, president of the Sierra Club board, announced Jealous’ termination Monday evening in an email to staff.</p>
<p>Murphy said in a statement that the board “made a difficult but principled decision to uphold our values and commitment to accountability, which will be carried forward by the leadership team.”</p>
<p>“We are heartened to see the Sierra Club take action to terminate Ben Jealous for cause,” Erica Dodt, president of the Progressive Workers Union, which represents Sierra Club employees, said in a statement. “Over a year ago, our union members overwhelmingly voted no confidence in Jealous’ leadership, citing his mismanagement of our organization’s strategy and budget and his ongoing attacks on our union. We hope that his departure will open the door for a stronger relationship between workers and management, and allow the Sierra Club to better focus our efforts on fighting the Trump administration and protecting the environment.”</p>
