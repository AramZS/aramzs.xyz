  Following Superman, Warner Bros. Announces James Gunn Is Now Writing and Set
  to Direct the ‘Next Installment in the Super-Family’

<p>Following the launch of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/superman-2025">Superman</a>, DC Universe steward James Gunn is now writing and preparing to direct the next movie in the ‘Super-Family,’ Warner Bros. has announced.</p>
<p>Confirmation comes from CEO David Zaslav in a financial call in which he said Superman marked “the beginning of a new era for DC Studios.”</p>
<p>"We're thrilled to share that James Gunn is already writing and preparing to direct the next installment within the 'Super-Family,'" Zaslav said.</p>
<p>But what is this mystery Superman follow-up? Gunn has spoken in the past about his next writer / director project for DC Studios, which sounds like it's sort of a Superman sequel, but isn't really.</p>
<p>Speaking to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://ew.com/superman-new-man-of-steel-leads-dcu-of-tomorrow-cover-story-11751060">Entertainment Weekly</a>, Gunn confirmed he has already begun working on Superman's next DCU appearance, although he wouldn't go so far as to call it a sequel. "What I'm working on is in some way… I mean, yes, yes, yes, yes," was his response to Superman getting a follow-up movie. "But is it a straight-up Superman sequel? I would not say necessarily."</p>
<p>Here's what we know so far: in film, DC Studios has Supergirl and Clayface coming out in 2026, and the next Wonder Woman, which doesn't have a release window. The Batman II, from Matt Reeves’ self-contained the ‘Batman Epic Crime Saga.’ will begin shooting next spring, with a release date set for 2027. Gunn has also talked about a Sgt. Rock adaptation, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/is-there-a-chance-well-see-superman-batman-and-wonder-woman-on-the-big-screen-together-in-the-rebooted-dcu-of-course-says-james-gunn-but-dont-hold-your-breath">a Justice League teamup</a> starring Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman. In February, Gunn and co-DC Studios CEO Peter Safran confirmed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/confirmed-robert-pattinson-will-not-be-the-dcu-batman"><u>The Brave and the Bold will introduce a new Batman into the DCU, ruling out current Batman actor Robert Pattinson in the process</u></a>.</p>
<p>In TV, the Batman Epic Crime Saga looks set for The Penguin Season 2, with DCU entry Peacemaker Season 2 out soon and a Lanterns series due in 2026. Gunn is reportedly considering TV spinoffs for characters such as Mister Terrific and Jimmy Olsen following their well-received supporting roles in Superman.</p>
<p>"In a precise and measured way, the DC franchise will increasingly overlay across the studio’s broader efforts: from film and TV to consumer products, games, experiences and social," Warner Bros. said.</p>
