  An Iconic Williamsburg Diner is Getting Converted into a Steiner Studios Movie
  Set
---
<p>Steiner Studio, the colossal complex of soundstages and production facilities tucked into the Brooklyn Navy Yards, is making it official with a cherished, but long-dormant Williamsburg diner.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/06/nyregion/wythe-diner-brooklyn-navy-yard.html"><em>The New York Times</em></a>, the iconic, time-capsuled 50’s-style restaurant at North 3rd Street and Wythe Avenue that has served as a backdrop in film, TV, and commercials, is reportedly being shipped in its entirety a few neighborhoods over to the studio’s expansive campus, where it will be fully converted into a movie set. “I priced a new diner,” said real estate developer and chairman of the studio Doug Steiner, adding how the acquisition “will cost about the same as having a new diner, but I’d rather have this one.”</p>
<p>Steiner claims he took notice of the Wythe Diner—which was once a fully functional, <em>actual</em> diner, pre-fabricated in New Jersey and all—while working on his first residential development project on Metropolitan Avenue in the 2000s. The space was bought in 1998 and sold (<a href="https://nypost.com/2025/08/01/real-estate/the-site-of-williamsburgs-famed-wythe-diner-has-sold/">just last week</a>) by Sandy Stillman, housing Stillman’s foie gras-slinging restaurant Relish until 2010, as well as a Mexican eatery and pop-ups for Blank Street and Chanel. But it hasn’t served a dish since 2018.</p>
<p>In its place, the new owners intend to build a 28-unit apartment building, which is obviously what the neighborhood needs most at the moment.</p>
