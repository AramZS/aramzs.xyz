<p>For the first time since masked agents started staking out the hallways of 26 Federal Plaza’s immigration courthouses in <a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/2025/05/29/ice-arrests-migrants-290-broadway-court-trump/">late May</a>, attorneys monitoring the building this week, said they didn’t witness a single arrest over the course of the entire day Monday.</p>
<p>After witnessing anywhere between five to 15 arrests of immigrants following their court hearings every day since late May, lawyer Allison Cutler said she was stunned.</p>
<p>“I felt as if I couldn’t trust it,” said Cutler, a supervising attorney with <a href="https://nylag.org/">New York Legal Assistance Group</a>, one of two lawyers who has been monitoring the corridors inside 26 Federal Plaza near daily. “When it gets quiet like that, it kind of sets off alarm bells for me. They’re planning.”</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Cutler said, they tallied just four detentions. By Wednesday morning, droves of masked ICE agents still lined the courthouse hallways on the 12th and 14th floors, making one arrest over the course of morning. But by around 11 a.m. the masked officers crammed into an elevator and disappeared from the building.</p>
<p>Thursday, the day attorneys say, when ICE typically conducts the most arrests, was also unusually quiet, Cutler said.</p>
<p>One factor: a lawsuit filed last week challenging detention inside the building, where dozens of people have been held overnight inside office spaces.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/2025/08/12/judge-trump-federal-immigration-restraining-order-ice/">temporary restraining order</a> by a federal judge Tuesday in that case dramatically limited the number of people ICE can hold at a time inside cells of the 10th floor of 26 Federal Plaza.</p>
<p>ICE has been holding people there after their arrests inside courthouses and in other locations, before sending them to detention centers elsewhere in the country.The capacity restriction imposed by the TRO means the agency will have to find another location to put people it detains or figure out how to transfer them quicker.</p>
<h2><strong>‘I’m Not Going’</strong></h2>
<p>There’s another reason that arrests inside courthouses may be slowing down: fewer and fewer people showing up to court, afraid they’ll be arrested if they do appear.</p>
<p>“They call us and say, I know I have a court hearing but I’m not going,”</p>
<p>Mamadou Drame told THE CITY, a volunteer and paralegal with the Senegalese Association of America who has been court-watching and helping to translate for people with immigration court hearings.</p>
<p>He’s said he’s urging people to appear no matter what. For someone in deportation proceedings, as all the people required to appear before immigration judges are, , the risk of not appearing in a case can be severe: judges in many instances will order the person deported precisely because they did not appear to plead their case, in what’s called a “removal in absentia.” That tosses a person’s asylum claim if they had submitted one to the court, and puts them at even greater risk of arrest and deportation.</p>
<p>But Drame says he’s often met with the same response from scared asylum-seekers: “‘You can’t convince me.’”</p>

<p>Immigrant advocates are trying to end the courthouse arrests. At least two lawsuits are pending before federal judges — <a href="https://hellgatenyc.com/immigrants-sue-trump/">one in Washington, D.C.</a>, and one in New York — both arguing the courthouse arrests are unlawful.</p>
<p>As part of the New York case, <a href="https://www.nyclu.org/press-release/legal-orgs-sue-trump-admin-over-unlawful-policy-of-arresting-people-who-attend-mandated-court-hearings">filed by the NYCLU, youth immigrant advocacy group The Door</a> and others, a former immigration New York immigration judge, Jennifer Durkin, who was among the judges fired by the Trump administration in July, said she’d already seen the ICE arrest tactic impacting her courtroom.</p>
<p>“As a result of the dismissals and ICE arrests in courthouses, I started to notice that more respondents were not showing up for their hearings, leading to an increase in absentia removal orders and motions to appear virtually,” <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/70993525/23/4/african-communities-together-v-lyons/">she wrote</a>. “The presence of ICE officers conducting arrests in courthouses also created fear amongst respondents and their families and general chaos for the public, court staff, and judges.”</p>
<p>In recent days, THE CITY observed several courtrooms where judges issued numerous removal orders for people who hadn’t shown up. In Judge John Siemietkowski’s courtroom at 26 Federal Plaza on a recent morning, 11 of 28 people ordered to appear didn’t show up, a far higher number of absences than would be typical before ICE started making arrests, insiders said.</p>
<p>After running through each case and assuring everyone gotten repeat notices in the mail of their court date he issued removal orders for nine people.</p>
<p>“The court orders these respondents be removed in absentia,” he said. “These matters are adjourned.”</p>
<p>Some judges have been approving requests for virtual appearances, so people don’t have to show up in person and brave thicket of masked federal agents. Other judges only approve those virtual appearances if the person has a lawyer.</p>
<p>Still other judges are mandating in-person appearances for everyone, whether or not the person has an attorney. The hearings targeted by ICE typically last for around five to 10 minutes, and are one of the first times a person sees a judge in their deportation case, long before they present their full asylum claim to a judge or a request for another form of immigration relief.</p>
<p>On a morning in late July, ICE agents waited outside the courtroom of Judge Tiesha Peal as she made her way through more than a dozen cases. At least one man leaving her courtroom was detained. She got through the people who had shown up in person, then switched to deal with several people who had joined virtually but without her prior permission. Peal was not sympathetic.</p>
<p>“Every last one of you I’m ordering removed. Let me give the government a list of all of your names,” she scolded.</p>
<p>“I did not give any of you permission to come on WebEx,” Peal said. “All of you are being ordered removed because all of you are supposed to be coming to court.”</p>
<h2><strong>Longterm Chill</strong></h2>
<p>For years, federal authorities had avoided targeting immigration courthouses because they would “inevitably produce a ‘chilling effect’ on noncitizens who appear before our immigration courts” and “disincentivize noncitizens from appearing for their hearings,” according to a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/d9/2023-12/oppm_re_dhs_enforcement_actions_in_or_near_ocij_space_-_12.11.2023.pdf">Biden-era memo</a> that codified the policy.</p>
<p>But shortly after Donald Trump was inaugurated, Sirce E. Owen, the newly-appointed acting director of the Executive Office for Immigration Review, the Justice Department branch that oversees the nation’s immigration courts, rescinded the Biden era guidance. Owen penned a <a href="https://www.aila.org/eoir-rescinds-and-cancels-oppm-on-enforcement-actions-in-or-near-ocij-space#:~:text=EOIR%20Acting%20Director%20Sirce%20Owen,which%20provided%20guidance%20on%20DHS">January 28</a> memo calling the prior rule “unpersuasive,” while also concluding “EOIR lacks the authority to prohibit DHS from conducting any action it is otherwise lawfully authorized to take.”</p>
<p>A subsequent <a href="https://www.ice.gov/doclib/foia/policy/11072.4.pdf">May 27 memo</a> published by ICE laid out the tactic explicitly. “Enforcement activities in or near courthouses are often required when jurisdictions refuse to cooperate with ICE, including when such jurisdictions refuse to honor immigration detainers and transfer aliens directly to ICE custody.”</p>
<p>Since then, New York City has become the epicenter of this arrest tactic, <a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/2025/08/11/26-federal-plaza-immigration-court-trump-arrests-data-analysis/">THE CITY reported</a> this week based on an analysis of immigration court data that showed ICE was making vastly more courthouses arrests in the city’s three courthouses than anywhere else in the nation.</p>
<p>Cutler, the NYLAG immigration attorney, worried that even if a judge steps in and blocks the courthouse arrests, their longterm impact would not be undone quickly.</p>
<p>“We’re going to be seeing this effect for years that no one will want to go to their hearing because they’re scared,” Cutler said.</p>
