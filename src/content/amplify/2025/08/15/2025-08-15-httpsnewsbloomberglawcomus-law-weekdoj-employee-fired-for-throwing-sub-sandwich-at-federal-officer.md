title: Viral DC Sandwich Thrower Fired From Justice Department Job (2)
---
<p>The man charged with assault for throwing a sandwich at a federal officer in Washington worked for the Justice Department and has been fired, Attorney General Pam Bondi announced.</p>
<p>“This is an example of the Deep State we have been up against for seven months as we work to refocus DOJ,” Bondi wrote on the social media platform X on Thursday. “You will NOT work in this administration while disrespecting our government and law enforcement.”</p>
<p>Sean Charles Dunn was charged Wednesday in Washington federal court under a federal statute prohibiting assaulting, resisting, or interfering with federal law enforcement officers, which includes both simple assault and assault with a deadly weapon. Bondi said he’d been charged with felony assault.</p>
<p>Dunn was an international affairs specialist with the Office of International Affairs within the department’s criminal division, according to a Justice Department official. The office handles international extraditions, prisoner swaps, and other overseas operations.</p>

<p>Dunn was captured in a viral video throwing a sandwich at an officer near the corner of 14th and U Street in Washington. The charges were filed after President Donald Trump’s administration announced a federal takeover of the Washington DC police department and <a data-terminal-id="T0NCZ6GOYMTN" href="https://news.bgov.com/bgov-newsletters-and-analysis/trump-surges-federal-police-to-patrol-dc-after-floating-takeover">deployed federal agents</a> to conduct enforcement actions in the city.</p>
<p>According to the Justice Department’s complaint, Dunn threw the sandwich on the night of Aug. 10 at an agent with Customs and Border Protection, part of the Department of Homeland Security, after yelling obscenities at him. While being processed, he told a local officer, “I did it. I threw a sandwich,” according to the filing.</p>
<p>“This alleged assault is no joke — it’s a serious crime, and those who think otherwise will learn just how gravely mistaken they are,” said Jeanine Pirro, the US attorney for DC, in a press release that said Dunn “hurled a hoagie” at an officer.</p>
<p>(Updates with Pirro statement in last paragraph.)</p>
