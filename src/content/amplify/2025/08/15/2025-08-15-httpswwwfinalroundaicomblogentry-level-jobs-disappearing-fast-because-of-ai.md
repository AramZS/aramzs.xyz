title: 9 Entry-Level Jobs Are Disappearing Fast Because of AI

<div><div cta-rich-text="" fs-toc-element="contents" fs-toc-offsettop="1.5rem"><figure></figure><p>Picture this: You've just tossed your cap at graduation, diploma in hand, ready to conquer the world. But months later, you're still scrolling through job boards, sending out resumes into what feels like a black hole.</p><p>This isn't just bad luck - <a href="https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/college-labor-market" target="_blank"><strong>4.8% of recent college graduates can't find jobs in 2025</strong></a>, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. </p><h2>AI Is Eating Entry-Level Jobs</h2><p>Here's what's really happening: artificial intelligence is taking over the exact tasks that used to be entry-level positions. AI can now handle customer service, data entry, basic writing, scheduling, simple research, and even basic coding work.</p><figure></figure><p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2023/03/31/goldman-sachs-predicts-300-million-jobs-will-be-lost-or-degraded-by-artificial-intelligence/" target="_blank">A Goldman Sachs analysis estimated that up to 300 million full-time jobs globally are exposed to AI automation</a>, including many admin, legal, and basic tech roles. These were often the jobs that gave people their first break and taught them how to work in a professional environment.</p><p><a href="https://fortune.com/2025/08/04/ai-is-coming-for-entry-level-jobs-bill-gates-says-gen-z-may-not-be-safe-no-matter-how-well-they-learn-to-use-it/" target="_blank">Entry-level job postings in the USA have dropped by about 35% since January 2023</a>, and much of this decline is directly linked to AI replacing those tasks.</p><p><strong>49% of young job seekers now believe AI has made their degrees less valuable</strong>. They're not wrong.</p><h2>How AI Changed Everything</h2><p>Traditional entry-level jobs involved routine tasks that helped new workers learn professional skills. You'd start with filing, answering phones, basic data analysis, or simple writing tasks. While doing these jobs, you'd learn how offices work, how to communicate professionally, and gain industry knowledge.</p><p>AI has eliminated many of these stepping-stone positions. ChatGPT can write emails and reports. AI customer service bots handle phone calls. Automated systems manage scheduling and data entry. Software can analyze basic data and create presentations.</p><p>One CEO told the Wall Street Journal he <a href="https://www.wsj.com/lifestyle/careers/ai-entry-level-jobs-graduates-b224d624" target="_blank">decided not to hire a summer intern this year, opting to run social media copy through ChatGPT instead</a>.</p><h2>Tech Companies Show How Bad It Gets</h2><p>The tech industry demonstrates exactly how AI is destroying entry-level opportunities. The biggest tech companies have cut new graduate hiring by more than 50% since 2019.</p><figure><figcaption>Source: <a href="https://www.signalfire.com/blog/signalfire-state-of-talent-report-2025">SignalFire</a></figcaption></figure><p>Companies like Salesforce and Shopify have explicitly said they're looking to meet their growth needs with AI rather than humans. <strong>Since 2021, the average age of technical hires has increased by three years as companies become unwilling to invest in training junior talent</strong>.</p><p>James O'Brien, a computer science professor at UC Berkeley, explained the thinking: "<strong>Why hire an undergraduate when AI is cheaper and quicker?</strong>" He noted that while AI-generated code isn't perfect, neither is code written by new graduates. The difference is that improving AI code takes minutes, while training a junior developer takes months.</p><p>In San Francisco,<strong> more than 80% of "entry-level" jobs now require at least two years of experience</strong>. That's not entry-level. That's companies wanting experienced workers at entry-level pay.</p><h2>The AI Filtering Problem Makes It Worse</h2><p><strong>Companies aren't just using AI to replace workers. They're using it to filter out job applicants too. </strong>When platforms like Indeed and LinkedIn became popular, companies started receiving as many as a thousand applications per day.</p><p>To handle this volume, they use Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) that automatically scan resumes. These systems reject applications that don't have the right keywords or experience requirements before any human sees them.</p><p>Companies set experience requirements not because jobs actually need experienced workers, but because it's an easy way to cut down applications. According to a <a href="https://www.hbs.edu/managing-the-future-of-work/Documents/research/hiddenworkers09032021.pdf" target="_blank">Harvard Business School and Accenture study</a>, 88% of employers believed that qualified candidates were filtered out because they didn't match exact criteria.</p><p><strong>So AI is both eliminating entry-level jobs and making it harder to get the jobs that remain</strong>.</p><h2>The Numbers Show How Bad It Really Is</h2><p>The scale of this problem becomes clear when you look at the data. <a href="https://www.hiringlab.org/2025/07/30/the-us-tech-hiring-freeze-continues/" target="_blank">Tech job postings on Indeed are down 36% from their early 2020 levels as of July 2025</a>, according to Indeed's research.</p><figure></figure><p>What's particularly telling is the timing. Nearly half of the decline in tech postings happened before ChatGPT was even released to the public. This suggests companies were already preparing for AI to replace workers.</p><p>The few tech jobs that are still growing? AI-related roles like <strong>Machine Learning Engineers, which remain up 59% from early 2020</strong>. <strong>Companies want people who can build AI systems, but they don't want entry-level workers who might be replaced by those systems.</strong></p><h2>These 9 Entry-Level Fields Are Most at Risk</h2><p>The impact of AI isn't hitting all entry-level jobs equally. New data from <a href="https://ravio.com/tech-jobs-report-2025" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Ravio</a> shows exactly which fields are seeing the biggest drops in entry-level hiring.</p><p>According to their 2024-2025 analysis, entry-level roles (P1 positions) have seen an average decrease in hiring rates of 73.4% compared to just a 7.4% decrease across all job levels.</p><p><strong>The hardest-hit entry-level positions include:</strong></p><p>1) Marketing – Down by 75.6% </p><p>2) People (HR &amp; Talent) – Down by 72.3% </p><p>3) Engineering – Down by 72.2% </p><p>4) Product – Down by 69.8% </p><p>5) Operations – Down by 66.7% </p><p>6) Commercial – Down by 64.8% </p><p>7) Finance – Down by 63.0% </p><p>8) Data – Down by 62.1% </p><p>9) Administration – Down by 62.7% </p><figure><figcaption>Source: <strong>Ravio</strong></figcaption></figure><p>These are exactly the types of routine, task-based roles that AI can now handle. Data entry, basic analysis, administrative tasks, and junior marketing work are all areas where AI tools excel.</p><p>The data shows that companies are using AI to eliminate the bottom rung of the career ladder entirely, making it nearly impossible for new graduates to get their foot in the door.</p><h2>What Job Seekers Can Do</h2><p>Since companies won't adapt, job seekers have to:</p><p><strong>1) Learn AI tools -</strong> Become expert at using ChatGPT, AI writing tools, data analysis software, and whatever AI tools are relevant to your field. Show you can work with AI, not compete against it.</p><p><strong>2) Build an AI-powered portfolio -</strong> Create projects that demonstrate you can use AI effectively to solve real problems. Show the results, not just that you have a degree.</p><p><strong>3) Target AI-resistant jobs.</strong> Focus on roles that require human judgment, creativity, relationship-building, or physical presence. These are harder for AI to replace.</p><p><strong>4) Get alternative credentials.</strong> - <a href="https://www.shrm.org/content/dam/en/shrm/about/press-room/Making-Alternative-Credentials-Work-A-New-Strategy-for-HR-Professionals.pdf" target="_blank">2022 SHRM study</a> found that 88% of executives believe alternative credentials are as good or better than traditional degrees for some roles. Get certified in AI tools and practical skills.</p><h2>The Bottom Line</h2><p>The entry-level job crisis is really about how we adapt to AI. Companies are choosing the easy path: e<strong>liminate jobs instead of reimagining how humans and AI can work together.</strong></p><p>This approach wastes human talent and makes AI adoption less effective. The companies that figure out how to train young people to work with AI will have a huge advantage over those that just replace workers entirely.</p><p>But until more companies make that shift, young job seekers are stuck in an impossible situation: <strong>competing against machines for jobs that increasingly don't exist, while needing experience they can't get to access the jobs that remain.</strong></p><p>The solution isn't to fear AI. It's to demand that companies use it responsibly by creating new types of entry-level positions that teach people to work with these powerful tools. Until that happens, the entry-level job crisis will only get worse.</p></div></div>
