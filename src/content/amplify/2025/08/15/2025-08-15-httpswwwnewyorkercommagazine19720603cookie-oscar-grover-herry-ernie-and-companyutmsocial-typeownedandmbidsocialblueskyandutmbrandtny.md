<p>When a seven-foot, yellow-feathered bird who is subject to depressions attempts to seat himself upon the letter “h” and fails, it is no longer simply an event in children’s television, or even in the media. It is part of the intellectual history of a generation, who are already in important ways the children of “Sesame Street.” There is an idiocy in current discourse, which calls things about which people can be angry or mistaken “controversial.” In that sense, “Sesame Street” and its sequel, “The Electric Company,” are controversial programs. It is as though all the lessons of New Deal federal planning and the sixties experience of the “local people,” the techniques of the totalitarian slogan and the American commercial, the devices of film and the cult of the famous, the research of educators and the talent of artists had combined in one small experiment to sell, by means of television, the rational, the humane, and the linear to little children.</p>
<p>The human characters of “Sesame Street” live in a brownstone on an integrated urban slum block, where, in the company of cloth figures called Muppets—most of which are brightly colored and furry—they teach, among other things, the alphabet, induction, friendliness, geometric forms, and counting. Oscar, the green-furred grouch who inhabits a trash can, where he collects fish heads, mud, an old sneaker, a petrified brownie, and who makes occasional trips, for the sake of his collection, to the dump, is not just a creature of whimsey, with a tendency to rant; he is something of an expert on ecology. His neighbor is the inexhaustibly obliging blue-furred Muppet Grover, who will run great distances, interminably, to illustrate the concepts “near” and “far,” who will patiently deliver to a restaurant customer the letters missing from his alphabet soup, who will dance, sing, and demonstrate in waltz time, “Around, around, around, around, over, under, and through,” and who will be frightened out of his hiccups and into unconsciousness by a not altogether successful creature called the Snuffleupagus, whom all the human members of the cast, black and white, Puerto Rican and Anglo, still take to be a figment of the seven-foot bird’s imagination.</p>
<p>Small children from poor or middle-class families who watch “Sesame Street” do better on cognitive tests and in first grade than children who do not watch it. Children who watch it frequently do better than children who watch it rarely. Children who begin to watch it at the age of three learn more rapidly than children who begin at four. Eighty per cent of America’s twelve million preschool children have watched it. Ninety-seven per cent of American households now have television. Yet Joan Ganz Cooney, the founder of the Children’s Television Workshop, which created both “Sesame Street” and “The Electric Company,” points out that in a survey of activities favored by preschool children watching television ranks second from the bottom, followed only by “petting my dog.” “They don’t dislike petting their dog,” Mrs. Cooney says. “It’s just not high on the list of their priorities.” Neither, evidently, is watching television. It doesn’t play with them, or, normally, offer them the pleasure of acquired competence in anything. But lots of children, particularly disadvantaged children, are becoming (in an expression the Children’s Television Workshop once used in research but now regrets) “zombies”—riveted, without any discernible reaction, to the television set; getting, within a year or two, beyond the natural aptitude of learning, for example, to read.</p>
<p>In the first year of “Sesame Street’s” existence, a Muppet, a cartoon, or a famous person from a network program (Bill Cosby, Pat Paulsen, all the Cartwrights from “Bonanza”) would recite the whole alphabet each day, not just for the sake of repetition but out of concern that a child who saw only ten letters in a single program might be misled into thinking he had mastered the whole thing. One day, the research staff discovered what has since been known as the James Earl Jones Effect. Mr. Jones recited the twenty-six letters slowly, in a tone of menace, staring directly into the camera. At the first recitation, children repeated the letters in his pauses; at the second, they were beginning to recognize the letters as they appeared on the screen beside him; after that, they began very quickly and with pleasure to recite the alphabet before him. The alphabet has now acquired, through the prestige the celebrities brought to it at first, and through later developments among the regular live cast, cartoons, and Muppets, such currency in preschool circles that daily repetitions are no longer necessary. Counting, too, has gone up since the first year, from ten to twenty; and when Big Bird persists in believing that the alphabet is a single, beautiful word pronounced “ab-ka-def-gi-jekyl-mnop-ker-stew-uk-zee,” which he can sing but not decipher, nobody seems confused, except him.</p>
<p>On “Sesame Street,” there has been an amiable, senile Muppet pedant, Herbert Birdsfoot, who is in the habit of addressing Kermit, the Muppet frog, as “young man,” and who, being profoundly devoted to physical education, found himself stuck one day in the middle of a deep knee bend. “Young man,” he said, looking pensively at the floor, to Kermit, “do you realize that you have webbed feet?” Kermit himself has given many lecture-demonstrations, among them one that embroiled him with the letter “W,” that program’s sponsor. Every program is “sponsored” by a few letters and numbers, which are given elaborate commercials in graphics and song. “Zap. Zap. Zap. Zap” may not be everybody’s description of the four lines of the letter “W,” but it was Kermit’s, and the shaggy blue-furred Cookie Monster ate the lecture’s subject anyway, transforming it, with successive bites, into an askew “N,” a “V,” a tilted “l,” and nothing. A substitute “W” began to wiggle, walk, and wobble—in a kind of visual, extraprose equivalent of onomatopoeia (the word “path” on “The Electric Company” walks down one)—and ultimately wrestle (a phonemic mistake, unusual on the program) with Kermit until he weakened. Kermit has had other misfortunes with lessons. When he was counting four eggs, for example, they hatched, and the chickens began to walk away, leaving three, and then two, and then one. “All right,” Kermit said, “there’s only one chicken left, so let’s count it.” The program is extremely patient with error and frustration.</p>
<p>There is the Muppet Ernie, neurotic, easily moved to tears, particularly by the letter “E,” with which his name begins. A Muppet salesman, with a green face and a blue nose, dressed in a shirt, tie, trousers, jacket, black hat, and trenchcoat, has repeatedly tried to sell Ernie the number 8. “Hang it on the wall,” he suggests at the beginning of his sales pitch. “Next time you wanna know how many legs an octopus has . . . next time you wanna know how many reindeer Santa Claus has . . . next time you wanna know what time you eat your breakfast . . .” and, with each sinister and ingratiating phrase, he flashes the 8 inside his trenchcoat furtively toward Ernie. It costs a nickel. Ernie does not buy it. “Sesame Street’s” attitudes toward consumerism are skeptical, except in the realm of learning.</p>
<p>“Our next contestant,” says the Muppet master of ceremonies in a little parody of the quiz show “Concentration,” “is a monster from Sesame Street.” The contestant is the Cookie Monster, known to some as Monster, to some as Cookie, and to fathers in the world outside, at bedtime, as a difficult creature to imitate the voice of. Cookie is a fanatic, undeviating in the quality of his obsession. He eats things. Many lessons on “Sesame Street” are terminated when something eats them. But Cookie, who has of late been eating mainly cookies, is a junkie. “To me, your nose is a cookie,” he once said to another Muppet in a desperate moment. He sees cookies in all things circular: a rubber-tire swing, or a bicycle wheel. Geometric forms are among the program’s many subjects. When cookies arrive, he tends to eat the entire shipment, but he is moved to empathy at the sight of a human being temporarily deprived of a cookie. “How sad,” he says. “You taking it so well.” He has never quite correctly learned the language. Other characters on “Sesame Street” use dialect, make grammatical errors, even speak in Spanish. The black expression “Give me some skin” has now become so common among characters asking for a handshake that Muppets say “Give me some fur.” On the quiz show, Cookie won by losing. There were four numbers on the wall, concealing prizes. As in “Concentration,” the object was to name the numbers that concealed matching prizes. Cookie failed to match anything. He lost a jet plane and won a consolation cookie. “Sesame Street” does not overvalue competition.</p>
<p>Herry, a dishevelled blue Muppet with a magenta nose (no program is a better argument for color television, which is, unlike color movies, in every way better than black-and-white), once confided his secret, the whole alphabet, with shyness, to Grover, who repeated it to several other Muppets, who repeated it, in turn, with incredulity. It was unlike Grover to betray a confidence, but, as a teaching method, it was an advance over several educational strategies of progressive schools in, say, the forties and fifties. I can remember classes learning to sing “This is / the symphony / that Mr. Schubert never finished.” “Sesame Street” uses the best techniques available, and develops new ones. There is an inspired, unlikely reading song composed of traffic signs: “In, Out, Park, Walk, Yield, Enter, Exit, One Way . . .” The whole program has this sort of odd, useful intelligence. There are beautiful animations: a fakir who counts on his fingers and, since the desired total is twenty, sprouts two extra arms before dissolving into the psychedelic, and doing the whole thing again in Spanish; a bluesy serpent who sings “I’m Sammy the snake. I go sssss in the morning;” a pride of uncaged, ferocious “x”s, one of which leaps to take its place in the word “exit;” cartoons by the Hubleys and Maurice Sendak; an instructive appearance by the Pink Panther. There are short films of real wildlife, some of them accompanied by instructions: “Everybody scratch” (which was redeemed by clips of penguins grooming and a baboon daintily scratching his wrist); some of them accompanied by music: a whale having his teeth brushed to the lyrics “I got those I-can’t-get-enough-of-brushin’-till-I-make-my-teeth-white blues;” some of them silent.</p>
<p>There are “Moonbird” voice-overs of uncoy, childish voices, and appearances by very small real children, some of whom fail, with the utmost confidence, to follow the instructions for such simple games as “Simon Says.” There are little discussions of seasons, weather, sirens, rain, and nightfall. And there are real adults. They are the least interesting characters on the program, partly because they lack the ingenuity of the fantastic, partly because their lives are meant to be so exemplary, unfrightening, and normal. They are a bit flat. Like other creatures on “Sesame Street,” and even on “The Electric Company,” they often sing off key. Like the songs of other creatures, too, their songs are often carefully unrhymed, for fear that a child will catch only a too tight rhyme scheme and lose the meaning.</p>
<p>What happens when an utterly charismatic presence appears on the program was illustrated a month ago. Jesse Jackson, once an associate of Martin Luther King, Jr., and the head of Chicago’s Operation Breadbasket, sat on the stoop of a Sesame Street brownstone. In cadences very moving and familiar, Mr. Jackson led a mesmerized integrated group of very little children in speaking such lines as “I am somebody. I may be four. But I am somebody. I am black. I am brown. I am white. I am somebody. I can learn anything. I can grow. I can be President. I can be governor. I can be mayor. I can change the world. Beautiful children can grow up and make the whole world beautiful. What time is it? Nation time. What time is it? Nation time,” and so on. The performance was followed by Kermit’s singing of one of the program’s most popular laments: “It’s not that easy being green, / Having to spend each day the color of the leaves.” Oscar the grouch soon demanded to know whether the children were listening to him, Oscar, told them, characteristically, that he did not care to see their ugly little faces, and unsentimentally slammed the lid of his trash can. There was no sense in which Jesse Jackson’s leading the children was controversial. But, for much of the country, the performance, and the integrated life on “Sesame Street” in general, may have been maddening. Nothing but the once apparently token but now vital appearance of black performers on network television would have put many adults in the frame of mind to stand it. The techniques of teaching and of demagogy are never quite distinct; one does learn some things by rote or chanting, because that is the most efficient way to learn them. But the people who run “Sesame Street” have so far been extremely wise about whom they permit to appear on the steps of that brownstone.</p>
<p>“Sesame Street” and, in other ways, “The Electric Company” are, with lapses, the most intelligent and important programs in television. That is not saying much yet. Their combined annual budget is thirteen million dollars—immense in terms of educational television, minuscule in comparison with programs on commercial stations or the cost of reaching an equivalent number of children by conventional teaching methods. The money is drawn from the Federal Office of Education, from foundations, and, recently, from sales of products (books, records, toys, Muppets, plastic letters and numbers) designed to help in teaching and to help the two programs become, to some degree, self-supporting. It is a very powerful collaboration of adults for children. Young adults from the Neighborhood Youth Corps, who feel that they themselves were ripped off by the school system through inadequate preparation, are teaching their younger brothers and sisters in local communities, in coöperation with the Workshop, with funds from the federal government. It is very hard for anybody, except the silly and the idle, to argue that learning to read itself is dated or a rip-off. A lot of what the programs create is really art—which is extraordinary, considering that the ideology here, the catechism, the product, is just letters, geometric forms, decency, and numbers.</p>

<p>No one but a few educators, who have argued on both sides of several questions (whether “Sesame Street” is too authoritarian or too permissive, too middle-class or too poor, too fast-paced or too unambitious), and one English TV program director, who used all these arguments simultaneously, has taken very strong exception to “Sesame Street” yet. There is going to be a “Plaza Sesamo,” a “Vila Sésamo,” a “Sesamstrasse,” and possibly a “Rue Sesame,” in addition to the English version of the program in the fifty countries where it already runs. But “The Electric Company” has higher, later stakes. It was designed specifically for the second-grader who is behind in reading. It teaches only verbal skills. But the audience consists of people who are older and younger than the target children. The younger ones, still also “Sesame Street” watchers, are not a problem. It is common these days to find a three-year-old, who still has trouble speaking, sounding out the brand name on a tea bag or a box of breakfast cereal. “’The Electric Company” has a black hippie reading freak, called Easy Reader, who dotes on legible matchbook covers. It has a daily soap-opera parody, called “Love of Chair,” in which almost nothing ever happens. “The boy,” the sentence reads, the announcer says, the scene demonstrates, “is sitting on the chair.” Or “The chair is sitting on the boy.” Accompanied by conventional soap organ music, the announcer concludes, “For the answer to these and other questions (What number are you calling? And what ever happened to Naomi?), tune in tomorrow for ‘Love of Chair.’ ” For some reason, this feature is extremely popular throughout the country. “The Electric Company” is used in eighteen thousand schools.</p>
<p>There is also an enlightening cooking lesson, given by “Julia Grownup,” who once taught the “ill” syllable by producing a grilled dill pickle with chilled vanilla filling. Miss Grownup (played by an excellent moronic comedienne, Judy Graubart) produced her masterpiece when she was demonstrating plurals. Regretfully, as she was making a fresh-fruit salad, Miss Graubart removed “s”s from her list, as she found herself, improvidently, with a bowl of grape, a box of raisin (“Can we get a closeup of the raisin? It’s a fine one”), and a solitary apple. To her great relief, she had a wheelbarrow of lettuce in her kitchen. She placed the three pieces of fruit upon it, and in dressing her salad she proudly added three plaid children’s dresses.</p>
<p>“The Electric Company” paints letters on everything—on newspapers, balloons, shoe soles, subway turnstiles, rows of medals, hats. It uses syllables as units of sound and units of meaning; it anthropomorphizes and ceaselessly alliterates them, as in two short, beautiful animations by the Hubleys: one featuring a languid night-club singer who breathes, “Tr ue, bl ue S ue,” the other starring a snarled green multi-legged snakelike creature who shoots “C” into “ool” at the billiard table and then produces “C ool, p ool, f ool.” A character called J. Arthur Crank regularly telephones to protest the similarity between the “ue” and the “oo” sounds, and other injustices in the language, but he doesn’t work out. A tortured horse in an animated cartoon about a cowboy who persists in singing—off key, as the “ie” sounds don’t match—“I could die for a piece of your pie” works better.</p>
<p>There is a frenetic, high-powered quiz program whose object is “The Secret Sound,” and whose master of ceremonies, Skip Hinnant, another excellent comic, is simply beside himself whenever anybody makes it. On a day when the secret sound was “ar,” the master of ceremonies was ecstatic when the contestant, Bill Cosby, spoke of someone who “gave me my big start;” he pivoted a full circle with enthusiasm when the contestant mentioned that he “works very hard;” he became totally hysterical by the time he heard the sentence “It’s pretty far.” The contestant, already loaded down with prizes, had his sleeves, his collar, and his mouth stuffed with money when he asked for a “cart” and went to pieces. The same sort of thing happened on a day when the sound was “th;” Bill Cosby appeared as an absentminded fellow with an umbrella in his jacket pocket, said he was too nervous to think, that his age was thirty, that he just couldn’t hold another thing, and added a final, fatal “Thank you.”</p>
<p>Comparatives are illustrated by the words, by their placement on the screen, by music, or by anything else that will help explain. “High, higher, highest” is a nightmare in semantics, graphics, music, synaesthesia. But there are graceful things, like a fine cartoon with a character who introduces herself as Myrna and then proceeds to name and gather up Myrna’s lamp, Myrna’s curtains, Myrna’s fireplace, Myrna’s other possessions, until she falls, by sheer weight, through the floor—and goes on about Myrna’s furnace and Myrna’s basement until she has altogether thoroughly illustrated the possessive.</p>
<p>There is a talentless but friendly child rock group, called “The Short Circus.” But there is also a splendid detective and decoder who, with one foot perpetually in a wastepaper basket, puts scrambled messages through a machine that looks like a washing machine with roller dryer. He studies such enigmas as “key’s The doormat. the under,” looks for capital letters and periods, and comes up with such formulations as “The key’s the doormat. There you have it! The key <em>is</em> the doormat.” He points out this nonpossessive use of the apostrophe, long before the actual message is correctly deciphered, with that tremendous enthusiasm and utter conviction that the entire cast brings to the most elementary spellings and inductions. “Mad” kicking the sinister silent “e” from “made;” a broom sweeping the word “litter” away; a mover unloading the letters “b,” “d,” and “e” from a van, assembling a word, and going to sleep on it; a cartoon Message Man who is always too slow to sound out instructions to “Run!,” “Step back!,” “Duck” (in this one, he is actually clipped from the air by a duck), or “Do not bother this giant person”—it is all still very uneven. It is also hard to predict what effects it will have on notions of written prose, which has its limitations.</p>
<p>Rita Moreno demonstrates punctuation with a group in a Latin rock song. There are animated parodies of “2001,” in which, with Richard Strauss music and a giant slab with metaphysical overtones, the syllables “oo,” “all,” “e,” and “alk” are created by seismic disturbance. (It does not seem to matter whether parodies are perceived by children as parodies; they tend to keep the program alive for the creators.) There is a subsequent bit in which a sage speaks of the four basic “alks” of life, and expresses her belief that life is a beanstalk. Minds are constantly kept shuttling between rules and exceptions, jokes and hard sells. The program always ends with a light bulb being turned off and the phrase “And now, the last word.” In the past, it has been “pajamas,” “sneeze,” “dim,” “reach,” and “garbage.” Next year, for complicated reasons, “The Electric Company” is going to make great use of the rebus.</p>
<p>What all this energy produces, except statistical results—unless you are observing an individual child who might have been watching “Sesame Street” for three years now—is very hard to measure. A lot of adults, veterans, prisoners, migrant workers, other people, watch it. A few weeks ago, in Jackson, Mississippi, Big Bird conducted the seventy-five-piece Jackson Symphony Orchestra. He led an integrated audience of more than ten thousand children and their parents in a passionate recitation of the alphabet. He counted to ten. The audience, including a few retarded adults and spastics, clapped and counted with him. Big Bird kept addressing the regular orchestra conductor, whose name is Lewis Dalvit, as “Mr. Dingbat,” recalling that other complicated political presence Archie Bunker. A Jackson policeman drove white, black, and Chicano members of the cast to the Jackson airport. The mayor had welcomed them when they came to town. Nation time.</p>
<p>The Children’s Television Workshop has seventeen full-time community organizers, working with local groups, parents, teen-agers, teachers, anybody, throughout the country. The organizer for Appalachia, Paul Elkins, is based in Clinch Valley, beside the River Clinch, in St. Paul, Virginia, where the biggest local employer is the Clinchfield Coal Company. Mr. Elkins was once a school principal, but now he works for “Sesame Street” and “The Electric Company.” When local people suspect the programs of Communism—because there are so many black people on them—Mr. Elkins, who was born and raised in Appalachia, reassures them, and changes the subject. He visits the people in shacks and schools. At the Riverview Elementary School in Clinch Valley one recent morning, three classes were watching “The Electric Company,” in color. The children deciphered the message “ho, Silver. Hi” with enthusiasm—while the cowboy on the screen was still remarking, “I said it to the horse, and he just looked at me.” They were very pleased with “Love of Chair.” At a nearby shack, a four-year-old boy had recently rubbed his eyes with oven cleaner, but his father, who was home on welfare, told Mr. Elkins he could not have watched “Sesame Street” anyway, since the television set, in a local expression for being out of order, had been “torn out” for two weeks. “You can turn the thing wide open and you can’t get a sound—not even ‘Bonanza,’ ” he said. The name “Brenda” and the letters “Bre,” “Br,” and “Bren” were printed all over the sagging front porch of another shack, near the rusting fragment of a car, the coal heap, and the garbage in the front yard. A young woman said her four-year-old daughter, Brenda, liked both “Sesame Street” and “The Electric Company.” A grandmother, farther along the hollow, said that one of the seven children of her three unmarried daughters particularly liked “Sesame Street.” “Ain’t no such thing as not watching it for Walter,” she said. A two-year-old with a bleeding eye walked in. His mother explained that someone had thrown a rock at a chicken the other day, “and he was just coming round the corner.” “Sesame Street” was not on the air just then. A soap opera, “Another World,” was. Everyone was watching. At the last shack in the hollow, a mother of three children, who had participated in workshops for mothers of “Sesame Street’s” most regular watchers, was asked by Mr. Elkins whether her four-year-old boy still watched the program. “Nope,” she said. ♦</p>
