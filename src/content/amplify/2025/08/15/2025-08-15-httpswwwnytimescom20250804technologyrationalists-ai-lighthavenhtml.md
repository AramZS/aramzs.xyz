<p>The Rationalists, a community focused on the risks of artificial intelligence, regularly gather with tech figures and other like-minded people in a complex that covers much of a city block.</p>
<p>Reporting from Berkeley, Calif.</p>
<p>In downtown Berkeley, an old hotel has become a temple to the pursuit of artificial intelligence and the future of humanity. Its name is Lighthaven.</p>
<p>Covering much of a city block, this gated complex includes five buildings and a small park dotted with rose bushes, stone fountains and neoclassical statues. Stained glass windows glisten on the top floor of the tallest building, called Bayes House after an 18th-century mathematician and philosopher.</p>
