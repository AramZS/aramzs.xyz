<h2><b>Surging Energy Demand</b></h2>
<p>Data centers currently consume about <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/energy-and-ai/energy-demand-from-ai">1.5% of global electricity</a>. The <a href="https://www.iea.org/news/ai-is-set-to-drive-surging-electricity-demand-from-data-centres-while-offering-the-potential-to-transform-how-the-energy-sector-works">International Energy Agency projects</a> that electricity demand will more than double to 945 terawatt-hours (TWh) by 2030‚Äîcomparable to Japan‚Äôs entire electricity demand in 2024. AI-optimized centers alone could see their electricity usage quadruple in that time.</p>
<p>Industry estimates paint a starker picture: <a href="https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/technology/technology-media-and-telecom-predictions/2025/genai-power-consumption-creates-need-for-more-sustainable-data-centers.html">Deloitte forecasts</a> that global data center consumption will reach around 1,065 TWh by 2030, with power demand from U.S. AI data centers <a href="https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/power-and-utilities/data-center-infrastructure-artificial-intelligence.html">growing more than thirtyfold</a> by 2035.</p>
<p>On July 24, 2025, the Trump administration unveiled ‚Äú<a href="https://www.ai.gov/">America‚Äôs AI Action Plan</a>,‚Äù stating: ‚ÄúWhoever has the largest AI ecosystem will set the global standards and reap broad economic and security benefits.‚Äù The announcement signals an aggressive federal push to expand AI infrastructure, with major implications for fossil fuel energy use, weakened regulatory oversight, and environmental injustice.</p>

<h2><b>Communities on the Frontlines of the Data Center Boom</b></h2>
<p>Residents across the country are raising alarms about the unchecked expansion of data centers. These massive energy- and water-intensive facilities are now being built at unprecedented speed to support artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and cryptocurrency operations.</p>
<p>Data center investments are often <a href="https://triblive.com/local/regional/a-superpower-for-energy-homer-city-power-station-developers-to-present-site-plans/">pitched as economic lifelines</a>, but communities fear they‚Äôll shoulder power disruptions, environmental injustice, and false promises.</p>

<h2>Regulatory loopholes: The story beneath the surface</h2>
<p>As data centers multiply across the U.S., operators may be exploiting regulatory loopholes to avoid oversight.</p>
<p>According to FracTracker‚Äôs research, it appears that industry is reclassifying data center facilities using obscure <a href="https://www.osha.gov/data/sic-search">Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes</a> like 4822 (Telegraph and Other Message Communications) and 8999 (Services, Not Elsewhere Classified), making them harder to detect in air permit databases. Misclassification may even allow operators to avoid triggering certain permit types‚Äîlike a Title V air permit‚Äîor slip through routine inspections. When data centers are hard to identify in the permitting systems, it becomes nearly impossible to assess their cumulative environmental impact, especially in communities already burdened by pollution.</p>
<p>In states like North Carolina and Florida, some operators appear to be intentionally keeping emissions below the 100-tons-per-year threshold that triggers <a href="https://www.eypmcfinc.com/post/data-center-air-quality">major-source air permitting</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, EPA‚Äôs May 2025 clarification now allows backup generators at data centers to run up to <a href="https://www.kirkland.com/publications/kirkland-alert/2025/05/new-epa-guidance-clarifies-when-data-centers-and-other-operators-may-utilize-emergency-backup">50 hours per year</a> in non‚Äëemergency demand‚Äëresponse situations, effectively institutionalizing more diesel engine use with limited oversight.</p>

<h2><b>Case Study: Pennsylvania Data Center Sprawl</b></h2>
<p><em>Updated as of 7/25/25</em></p>
<p>Pennsylvania‚Äîsecond only to Texas in fracked gas production‚Äîis rapidly becoming a hotspot for AI data centers.</p>
<p>In the second-largest fracked gas producing state, Republican lawmakers in the Pennsylvania Senate and House are advancing legislation to entice AI data center developers with tax breaks, regulatory exemptions, and waivers of environmental standards‚Äîdespite the industry already announcing more than <a href="https://paenvironmentdaily.blogspot.com/2025/07/list-of-more-than-90-billion-in-energy.html">$90 billion</a> in new investments in the state. Some provisions would substitute developer-submitted, AI-assisted engineering assurances in place of multi-year DEP reviews. <a href="https://paenvironmentdaily.blogspot.com/2025/07/pa-republican-lawmakers-rush-to.html">Former Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) Secretary David Hess notes</a> that many current permit applications already rely on incomplete or flawed documentation.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania‚Äôs <a href="https://www.pa.gov/agencies/revenue/incentives-credits-and-programs/computer-data-center-equipment-program">Computer Data Center Equipment Exemption Program</a> amounts to a taxpayer-funded subsidy that directly benefits data center operators. Since these facilities purchase billions of dollars‚Äô worth of equipment, the policy effectively costs the state hundreds of millions of dollars in foregone revenue.</p>
<p>In April 2025, Homer City Redevelopment (HCR) <a href="https://www.homercityredevelopment.com/project-overview">announced</a> that they will turn a decommissioned coal power plant into a 3,200-acre campus of fracked gas-powered data centers optimized for AI and high-performance computing. The ‚ÄúHomer City Energy Campus‚Äù will become the largest fracked gas-powered plant in the country, generating up to 4.5 gigawatts (GW) of power to run the AI-driven hyperscale data centers.</p>
<p>At a high-profile Energy and Innovation Summit hosted by Senator Dave McCormick (R ‚Äì PA) at Pittsburgh‚Äôs Carnegie Mellon University, President Donald Trump announced a $92 billion package of investment pledges in Pennsylvania‚Äôs AI and energy sectors. He called it the largest commitment in the state‚Äôs history, including robust funding for AI data centers alongside new power investments‚Äîfrom nuclear to so-called ‚Äú<a href="https://www.publicsource.org/trump-mccormick-visit-cmu-energy-innovation-summit-pittsburgh/">clean, beautiful coal.</a>‚Äù</p>
<p>The summit also featured remarks from PA Democratic Governor Josh Shapiro and attendance by global tech and energy executives. Outside the summit, protests erupted over concerns about environmental impacts, energy strain, and a lack of public input as Pennsylvania positions itself for fossil‚Äëfuel‚Äëdriven AI expansion. Better Path Coalition and No False Climate Solutions PA submitted a <a href="https://4825d078-f0fb-4e80-8fe9-5c576d8cdc6c.usrfiles.com/ugd/4825d0_8e8f19d8110449ea834c1c9d97196058.pdf">letter</a> to Shapiro signed by 27 organizations opposing Shapiro‚Äôs attendance and support of the fossil fuel industry, stating that he has ‚Äúchosen to speed only the permitting of fossil fuel and nuclear projects that will condemn future generations, including those of your own family, to climate chaos they may not be able to endure.‚Äù</p>

<h2><strong>Summary</strong></h2>
<p>The AI and crypto data center surge is reshaping the U.S. energy landscape, largely out of public view. FracTracker‚Äôs National Data Centers Tracker pulls back the curtain, revealing where projects are under way, how they‚Äôre permitted (or not), and who they impact.</p>
<p>This Tracker is part of FracTracker‚Äôs broader effort to ensure environmental transparency, protect community health, and hold industries accountable. AI and proof-of-work cryptocurrency data centers are rapidly growing forms of energy infrastructure‚Äîyet many operate under increasingly deregulated conditions, shifting the burden onto communities already facing environmental injustice, water shortages, and grid stress.</p>
