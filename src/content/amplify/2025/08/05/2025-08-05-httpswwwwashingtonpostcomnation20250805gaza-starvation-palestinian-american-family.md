<p>A U.S. citizen watches from afar as her relatives in a war zone struggle to survive.</p>
<p>National correspondent Danielle Paquette spent an afternoon in Upper Marlboro, Maryland, with a U.S. citizen from Gaza as she spoke by video with her family in the Palestinian enclave.</p>
<p>They used to swap TikTok recipes and photos of mouthwatering spreads: crispy falafel, baked chicken, grilled beef kebabs. Now her aunt in Gaza appeared on a WhatsApp video call with sunken eyes. The proud foodie was down to three cups of lentils and her last sack of flour.</p>
<p>“We can make that stretch,” Aunt Fairouz was saying, “for two more days.”</p>
