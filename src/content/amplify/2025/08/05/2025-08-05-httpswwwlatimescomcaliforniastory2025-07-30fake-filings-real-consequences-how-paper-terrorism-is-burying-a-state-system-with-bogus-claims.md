<p>SACRAMENTO — Texas real estate agent Tara Jarrett opened the online class with a prayer, bowing her head and closing her eyes.</p>
<p>“Dear Heavenly Father,” she began. “I ask that you would just speak to me and through me as I deliver this detailed message tonight.”</p>
<p>What followed was a lesson on revenge.</p>
<p>Jarrett walked the attendees, logged in from California and other states, through the process of filing liens to punish public officials, such as politicians and judges, who they alleged aren’t upholding their oaths of office. Those liens are recorded in state Uniform Commercial Code databases, public filings intended to alert creditors about business debts and financial obligations.</p>
