<p>“We discussed tariffs, economic cooperation, and it served as preparation for his call with Prime Minister Støre. I will not go into further detail about the content of the conversation,” he added.</p>
<p>Trump’s Friday meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska could prove to be the ultimate test for his Nobel Peace Prize case, as any breakthrough or misstep on the Ukraine conflict would likely affect his peacemaking credentials.</p>
<p>While oscillating on who’s to blame for the Russian full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Trump has appeared to harden his rhetorical position on Putin in recent months.</p>
<p>Every year, the Norwegian Nobel Committee selects laureates from hundreds of nominees. Its five members are appointed by Norway’s parliament in line with the instructions of 19th-century Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel. Winners are announced each October in Oslo.</p>
<p>Several countries, including <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/08/trump-nominated-nobel-peace-prize-netanyahu">Israel</a>, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyx5yw8y28o">Pakistan</a> and <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/08/07/world/cambodia-trump-nobel-prize-intl-hnk">Cambodia</a>, have already nominated Trump for brokering peace agreements or ceasefires since he returned to office in January.</p>
<p>Trump <a href="https://www.cnbctv18.com/world/settled-a-war-a-month-says-trump-taking-credit-again-for-ending-india-pakistan-conflict-19647989.htm">has claimed credit</a> for cooling tensions between nuclear-armed India and Pakistan after skirmishes earlier this year, and last week <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/08/07/us-deal-armenia-azerbaijan-00499285">hosted the leaders</a> of Armenia and Azerbaijan in Washington to address ending decades of hostilities.</p>
