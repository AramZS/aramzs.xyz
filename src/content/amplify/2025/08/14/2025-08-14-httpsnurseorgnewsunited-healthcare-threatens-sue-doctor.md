<p><a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/unitedhealth-sick-everyone-complaining-claim-150000816.html">UnitedHealthcare</a> is threatening legal action against Dr. Elisabeth Potter, a plastic surgeon from Austin, Texas, who <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/unitedhealthcare-calls-doctor-mid-surgery-201800124.html">claimed</a> the insurer interrupted her during surgery. In January 2025, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@drelisabethpotter">Potter</a> shared a video on social media describing how she was performing breast reconstruction surgery on a cancer patient when UnitedHealthcare <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/doctor-says-unitedhealthcare-stopped-cancer-surgery-ask-if-necessary-2012069">called</a> the operating room. She had to step out of surgery to <a href="https://clearhealthcosts.com/blog/2025/01/doctor-says-unitedhealthcare-stopped-cancer-surgery-to-ask-if-it-was-necessary/">address</a> the call, only to find that the representative <a href="https://www.nationofchange.org/2025/01/10/unitedhealthcare-interrupts-doctor-mid-surgery-to-question-patients-cancer-care/">lacked</a> full access to the patient's medical records, despite the procedure being pre-approved.</p>
<p>This incident occurs in the context of heightened scrutiny of UnitedHealthcare following the murder of its CEO, Brian Thompson, in December 2024. The company has been facing criticism over its claim denial practices and is taking steps to protect its image. Potter's <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@drelisabethpotter/video/7457293170678762798">video</a>, which remains active with more than 5.5 million views and nearly 850,000 likes, has contributed to the ongoing debate about insurance companies' influence on patient care and medical decisions.</p>

<p>The controversy began when Dr. Elizabeth Potter took to social media to share her experience with UnitedHealthcare. In her posts, she alleged that the insurance company contacted her mid-surgery, demanding information about a patient's diagnosis and justification for an inpatient overnight stay. This <a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/unitedhealthcare-sends-threatening-legal-letter-to-surgeon/">claim</a> was particularly alarming to <a href="https://clearhealthcosts.com/blog/2025/02/wealthy-investor-steps-in-to-defend-doctor-against-unitedhealth/">many</a>, as Dr. Potter stated that the procedure had been pre-approved by UnitedHealthcare.</p>
<blockquote data-video-id="7457293170678762798"> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@drelisabethpotter?refer=embed">@drelisabethpotter</a> <p>Itâ€™s 2025, and navigating insurance has somehow gotten even more out of controlâ€¦ I just performed two bilateral DIEP flap surgeries and two bilateral tissue expander surgeries. During one of the DIEP cases, I was interrupted by a call from United Healthcareâ€”while the patient was already asleep on the operating table. They demanded information about her diagnosis and inpatient stay justification. I had to scrub out mid-surgery to call United, only to find that the person on the line didnâ€™t even have access to the patientâ€™s full medical information, despite the procedure already being pre-approved. Itâ€™s beyond frustrating and, frankly, unacceptable. Patients and providers deserve better than this. We should be focused on care, not bureaucracy. I just have no other words at this point</p> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7457293180162214702?refer=embed">â™¬ original sound - Dr. Elisabeth Potter</a> </blockquote>
<p>The surgeon's account quickly went viral, resonating with many healthcare professionals who have expressed frustration with insurance companies' practices. Dr. Potter's story seemed to epitomize concerns about insurers interfering with medical decisions and potentially compromising patient care.</p>
<h2 data-subhead="subhead-2" data-title="UnitedHealthcare Denies Allegations and Threatens Legal Action">UnitedHealthcare Denies Allegations and Threatens Legal Action</h2>
<p>In response to Dr. Potter's claims, UnitedHealthcare has taken a firm stance, categorically denying the surgeon's account of events. The insurance giant contends that Dr. Potter was never asked to step out of surgery and that the only contact made was to confirm if an overnight stay request had been made in error.</p>
<p>UnitedHealthcare's reaction to Dr. Potter's social media posts has been swift and severe. The company has sent a legal letter to the surgeon, accusing her of knowingly sharing misinformation. In this letter, UnitedHealthcare demands that Dr. Potter remove her videos and issue a public apology. This aggressive legal approach has further fueled the controversy, with many viewing it as an attempt to silence a healthcare provider speaking out about her experiences.</p>
<p>UnitedHealthcare has engaged <a href="https://clarelocke.com/">Clare Locke</a>, a prominent defamation law firm, to pursue its <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/unitedhealthcare-threatens-legal-action-against-170028021.html">case</a> against Potter. The insurer sent a letter to Potter demanding she revise her post, issue an apology, and renounce any implied threats of violence that UnitedHealth attributed to her video. UnitedHealthcare claims that Potter's assertion of being called out of surgery is untrue and that she is spreading misinformation.</p>

<p>In an unexpected turn of events, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Ackman">Bill Ackman</a>, a prominent wealthy investor, has offered to cover Dr. Potter's legal expenses in her defense against UnitedHealthcare's claims. This intervention by a high-profile figure outside the medical community has added another layer of complexity to the situation and drawn even more attention to the dispute.</p>
<p>Ackman's involvement underscores the broader implications of this case, suggesting that the issues at stake extend beyond the medical field and into the realm of corporate accountability and free speech.</p>
<h2 data-subhead="subhead-4" data-title="Doctor Stands Firm Amid Controversy">Doctor Stands Firm Amid Controversy</h2>
<p>Despite the pressure from UnitedHealthcare, Dr. Potter has remained steadfast in her position. She maintains that she told the truth about her experience and refuses to be silenced. Dr. Potter has emphasized the importance of doctor-ordered overnight stays, stating that denying them can be dangerous for patients.</p>

<p>This stance has garnered support from many in the medical community who share concerns about insurance companies overriding medical decisions. Dr. Potter's refusal to back down has transformed her into a symbol of resistance against perceived overreach by insurance providers in healthcare decisions.</p>
<p>This controversy comes at a tumultuous time for UnitedHealthcare, following the recent assassination of its CEO and subsequent market losses. The dispute with Dr. Potter adds to the company's challenges and raises questions about its relationships with healthcare providers, its approach to patient care, and the potential conflicts between financial considerations and patient welfare. It also highlights the power of social media as a platform for healthcare professionals to voice their concerns and experiences.</p>
