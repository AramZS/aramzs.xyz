<p>In hindsight, Friday the 13th was a pretty good day to meet Steve Buscemi. Here was an actor, after all, who has played some of the most star-crossed schmucks ever committed to the screen.</p>
<p>Still, the timing also seemed fortuitous, I suggested, because of the series we were planning to talk about. It was a mild afternoon in June, and we had just met for lunch at a Midtown Manhattan hotel to talk about “Wednesday,” Netflix’s spooky, sardonic and spectacularly popular addition to the Addams Family canon.</p>
<p>Buscemi had been cast in Season 2 as Barry Dort, the new principal of Nevermore Academy, a boarding school for werewolves, vampires and the perpetually gloomy Wednesday Addams (Jenna Ortega). Dort models himself after Edgar Allan Poe and is “a big fan of Nevermore,” Buscemi said, though the principal has “nefarious reasons for being there” — an affable dork with a dark side, which is practically Buscemi’s brand.</p>
<p>For Buscemi, though, our meeting date was auspicious for an additional reason: “I always loved Friday the 13th,” he said, because he was born on one. (December 1957, for any astrologers keeping track.)</p>
<p>Buscemi’s personal connection to the unluckiest of days makes a poetic kind of sense given the roster of hard-luck characters he has brought to life over the decades. It also makes a perverse kind of sense for a guy from humble beginnings who has experienced his own share of tough luck. He has been stabbed, been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/12/nyregion/steve-buscemi-attack.html">punched</a> by a stranger and suffered immense personal tragedy. He has been hit by a car and hit by a bus. He keeps coming back, keeps working.</p>

<p>“He’s attracted the weirdest energy,” said the filmmaker Jim Jarmusch, a close friend and longtime collaborator. “You know, he’s so buoyant, but as a friend I sometimes feel a little protective when I think he needs a little bit of a break from it all.”</p>
<p>For people over a certain age, it is hard to imagine pop culture without Buscemi. His work as a director and writer notwithstanding, he has an acting résumé around 200 credits long. He is the <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/how-do-you-do-fellow-kids">subject of memes</a>, and of effusive news articles when he <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/01/entertainment/steve-buscemi-meme-candy-intl-scli">dresses up</a> as those memes for Halloween. He is the <a href="https://hardtickettohomevideo.com/2013/08/07/top-9-tattoos-of-steve-buscemi/">subject of tattoos</a> and of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qe4fETPSOQ">reality TV</a> about removing tattoos. And yet for such a ubiquitous presence, he is fiercely protective of his private life, a singular figure of American life who in many ways remains as obscure as when he first broke onto the New York independent film scene in the mid-1980s.</p>
<p>“He’s just somebody that you can’t really define — and that’s what makes him beautiful,” said Tim Burton, an executive producer of “Wednesday” who has directed half the episodes of the series. “What’s lacking in the movie industry these days is a certain level of mystery with people. And he still has that quality.”</p>

<p>With Season 2 of “Wednesday,” the first four episodes of which debuted last week, millions of younger viewers may be getting to know him for the first time. Despite having starred in some of the most acclaimed films and TV shows of the past 40 years, including “Reservoir Dogs,” “Fargo” and “The Sopranos,” he might just find his single biggest audience this summer. (According to Netflix, “Wednesday” is the most popular English-language series in the streamer’s history.)</p>
<p>“It’s nice and exciting to be in a show that people actually know about,” Buscemi said with a wry chuckle. Mentions of his most recent regular TV role, in the underappreciated TBS comedy “Miracle Workers,” had elicited mostly blank stares, he said. “As soon as I mention ‘Wednesday,’ it’s like, ‘Ohhh, yes, my kids love that!’”</p>
<p>In the brightly lit dining room of the hotel restaurant, we ordered identically boring lunches of chicken Caesar salad and bread. Early on, our table was one of only two or three that had been seated. But as we spoke, the room filled with people.</p>
<p>I pushed my voice recorder closer. For a guy who often plays explosive, indignant malcontents, he is a surprisingly careful and quiet talker.</p>
<p><strong>SAY THE NAME</strong> in your mind: Steve Buscemi. There’s a good chance you’re saying it wrong.</p>
<p>“Initially, people called him ‘Boo-SHEH-mee,’ and he didn’t correct people,” said the writer Terence Winter, whose period crime drama “Boardwalk Empire” Buscemi led for five seasons on HBO. He first met Buscemi as a writer on “The Sopranos,” which Buscemi starred in for one season in addition to having directed several episodes, including the brilliant two-hander “Pine Barrens.”</p>
<p>Winter suspected early on that he was saying “Buscemi” wrong. Eventually, he just asked.</p>
<p>“I said, ‘Well, people are just going to continue to call you the wrong name!’” Winter recalled. “And he’s like, ‘I really don’t care.’”</p>
<p>For the record, it’s “Boo-SEM-ee.”</p>

<p>It’s hard to think of another actor so widely admired but whose name is so widely mispronounced. But Buscemi’s life and career are replete with paradox. His face and voice are unmistakable, but his talent for transformation has made him one of the best-known character actors. (His young “Wednesday” co-star Emma Myers had a theory: “I think the more distinct you look, the better your roles are.”) A wiry 5-foot-9, he is outwardly no one’s idea of a tough guy. But in the early 1980s, Buscemi, a firefighter at the time, might have run into a burning building to save your life.</p>
<p>“I knew him when he was still a fireman,” said Jarmusch, who first got to know Buscemi when Buscemi was doing stand-up and experimental sketch comedy in the vibrant performing-arts underground of downtown Manhattan in the late 1970s and ’80s. “I used to feel so cool when sometimes the fire truck went by and I waved and Steve waved back.”</p>
<p>Buscemi lived the first eight years of his life in East New York, a working-class neighborhood in Brooklyn, before his parents moved him and his three brothers to the working-class village of Valley Stream, on Long Island. It was “in a lot of ways, a quote-unquote normal upbringing,” he said. But big ambitions weren’t particularly encouraged.</p>
<p>“My dad, you know, used to talk a lot about how he just wanted to get by,” Buscemi recalled later in a phone interview. An early memory was of overhearing his father, a sanitation worker, “talk about his kids as, that maybe we were not college material,” he said. He worried it meant he wasn’t smart. “It definitely affected me.”</p>
<p>He did go to community college, but he dropped out after one semester. He worked at a gas station. He drove an ice cream truck. These were the difficult, anxiety-filled years he drew from later for his quietly tragic film “Trees Lounge” (1996), which he wrote, directed and starred in. In it, he plays a young alcoholic Long Islander who is flailing at that critical moment when there’s still time to break free and avoid a much smaller, sadder fate.</p>

<p>“I had these dreams of wanting to be an actor but not feeling comfortable enough to tell people that that’s what I wanted,” he said, adding, “There was a huge fear of taking that leap.”</p>
<p>He moved to the East Village in the late 1970s, and in the ensuing years, he had to push constantly against that fear. By the mid-80s, he began to pick up acting roles, first with seminal underground filmmakers like Eric Mitchell (“The Way It Is”) and Bill Sherwood (“Parting Glances”), and then with ascendant indie darlings like Jarmusch (“Mystery Train,” “Coffee and Cigarettes”), Alexandre Rockwell (“In the Soup”) and the Coen Brothers (“Miller’s Crossing,” “Barton Fink”).</p>
<p>Around that time, in 1991, he got a script for a talky heist movie from an up-and-coming filmmaker named Quentin Tarantino.</p>
<p>“Reservoir Dogs,” in which Buscemi plays the loudmouth, anti-tipping Mr. Pink, changed everything — including by allowing Buscemi to brush off his agent’s exhortations to move to Hollywood. He could continue to be a New York actor, keeping a foot in the local independent film and theater scenes, as other actors he admired had managed to, like Willem Dafoe and John Turturro.</p>
<p>From the outside, success like Buscemi’s can seem almost inevitable in retrospect; one role seems to lead right into the next. But as most actors know, there’s nothing inevitable about it. “These careers, they’re like you’re in the circus — you don’t know what’s going to happen,” said Turturro, a friend who has appeared with Buscemi in several movies. “When things are going well, you have to be thankful and fortunate. You know, it’s not what it seems.”</p>
<p>You also have to stay grounded; it helps when you’ve had nothing handed to you.</p>
<p>“When you look at all the people that Steve Buscemi’s worked with, he’s worked with some real nut jobs,” said Catherine Zeta-Jones, who plays Morticia Addams in “Wednesday.” But somehow, she said, he has kept an even keel, “and I think that’s the paradox of being very, very rooted to the reality of this world.”</p>
<p><strong>BUSCEMI’S DAILY LIFE </strong>looks notably different today than it did some years ago, when he could be spotted handing out Halloween candy from his Brooklyn stoop, or when an <a href="https://www.brooklynpaper.com/buscemi-wins-sloper-ceases-his-blog-whats-on-buscemis-stoop/">entire blog</a> was dedicated to the stuff that appeared on that stoop. Lucian, his only son, moved to Los Angeles more than a decade ago. The filmmaker and artist <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/16/obituaries/jo-andres-dead.html">Jo Andres</a>, his wife of more than 30 years, died of a rare bowel disease in 2019.</p>
<p>He still owns his Brooklyn brownstone, he said, “but it’s not right for me anymore, you know? It’s just — it’s too big.”</p>
<p>Buscemi carries his grief visibly, speaks about it candidly; his eyes welled with tears as he spoke about Andres. It struck me that only a month after she died, Season 1 of “Miracle Workers” premiered, in which he plays a version of God who is an illiterate idiot.</p>
<p>But “grief is not linear,” as he noted, and it can coexist with happiness on separate planes. Earlier this year, he remarried, very quietly. His wife, Karen Ho, does not work in the industry, and “her tastes are totally different from mine in movies,” Buscemi said. He joined her in Manhattan, where they found a new place together. Then he moved his mother to the area from Staten Island, partly to keep a closer eye on her health.</p>
<p>He misses the Brooklyn stoop culture but doesn’t miss all the schlepping between boroughs. “I’m very happy and grateful,” he said.</p>
<p>At 67, Buscemi has in many ways become a symbol of a vanishing class of misfits, artists and ruffians who made their names in a grittier, more analog version of New York, a New York that existed before the new attention economy made visibility both the end and the means. He often tells young actors not to obsess over getting discovered; just go out and do, he says, and “the work will come to you if you’ve got something really to offer.” He made me hope that this was still true.</p>
<p>The inspiration he provided to his younger colleagues from “Wednesday” was, at least, an encouraging sign. Ortega, 22, described him in fatherly terms: “Without trying to be or in any sort of patronizing ways, he is a great source of wisdom and advice and life lessons,” she said.</p>
<p>And then she went on to compare him to an oak tree.</p>
<p>“You don’t know how it got there, or what its history is,” she said. “It’s seen a lot; it’s done a lot. But it stands there, and it’s beautiful and it’s welcoming.”</p>
