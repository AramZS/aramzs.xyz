  US Attorney Pirro's office admits grand jury refused ICE interference charges
  — twice
---
<p>Federal prosecutors told a judge they had failed twice to secure an indictment against Sydney Lori Reid for allegedly assaulting an FBI agent during an ICE arrest.</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Federal prosecutors twice sought a grand jury indictment against a D.C. woman accused of assaulting an FBI agent during an ICE inmate transfer — and were twice rejected, the U.S. Attorney’s Office admitted in court Thursday.</p>
<p>Magistrate Judge G. Michael Harvey revealed the denials to attorneys for <a href="https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/crime/woman-placed-herself-between-ice-man-during-custody-transfer-charged-struggle-doj-says/65-14b52bd8-422a-4a66-b282-4a8d6933e6f2">Sydney Lori Reid</a> and later granted their request to remove all bond conditions and release her on her own recognizance over prosecutors’ objections. He will resume a preliminary hearing on Friday afternoon to determine whether to dismiss the case entirely.</p>
<p>“Two presentations to the grand jury returned no bill both times,” Harvey said. “Suggesting the evidence is wanting, given the standard for indictment is probable cause. Suggesting the government may never get an indictment.”</p>
<p>Grand juries are tasked with deciding only whether there is a reasonable basis to support charging someone with a crime – a much lower burden for prosecutors than the beyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard of criminal juries – and typically make their decisions after hearing evidence only from the government. At the federal level, grand juries return indictments, or “true bills,” in the vast majority of cases.</p>
<p>Reid, 44, was <a href="https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/crime/woman-placed-herself-between-ice-man-during-custody-transfer-charged-struggle-doj-says/65-14b52bd8-422a-4a66-b282-4a8d6933e6f2">charged last month with an enhanced felony version of an assault charge</a> that requires inflicting bodily injury on a federal officer and carries a maximum sentence of up to eight years in prison. The charge is the same offense filed this week against a former DOJ employee <a href="https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/crime/sandwich-immigration-throw-police-law-enforcement-crime-washington-dc-northwest-u-street/65-40c89003-2317-42a5-a0a3-0f1362d93d20">accused of throwing a sandwich at a U.S. Customs and Border Protection agent</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/pr/woman-who-tried-impede-transfer-alleged-gang-member-ice-custody-charged-assault-fbi">a press release</a> last month, U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro’s office accused Reid of trying to impede the transfer of two alleged members of the 18th Street gang who were being arrested by ICE outside the D.C. Jail prior to transfer to the custody of the FBI.</p>
<p>Federal prosecutors declined to call the injured FBI agent or any of the ICE officers involved in the incident during Thursday’s hearing, however. Instead, they had an investigator with the U.S. Attorney’s Office testify about his review of video of the incident and brief conversations with the officers. The investigator, Special Agent Sean Ricardi, said he’d had no involvement in the case until he was asked to prepare for testimony Thursday morning.</p>
<p>Video played by prosecutors shows Reid approaching the ICE officers while holding up her phone, which she says is for her protection. She is then later seen being held by multiple officers against a wall while she asks, “How do you feel about stealing f***ing people?”</p>
<p>“Mind your own business!” an unidentified ICE agent can be heard responding.</p>
<p>Ricardi said while officers were attempting to control her, Reid’s “flailing arm movements made contact” with the FBI agent. No injury is shown on the videos played in court, although prosecutors submitted photographs of the agent with small abrasions on the back of her hand, which Ricardi said did not appear to be present prior to the incident.</p>
<p>Eugene Ohm, an assistant federal public defender representing Reid, said prosecutors were presenting the court with nothing but “hearsay” from an investigator who wasn’t present. He asked Harvey to review the grand jury testimony himself before ruling on probable cause, although Harvey declined.</p>
<p>“We should be able to get to the bottom of why all the citizens of the District of Columbia seem to think there’s no crime while the government continues to allege one against my client,” Ohm said.</p>
<p>Because Reid is charged with a felony, under federal law, prosecutors must secure an indictment within 30 days of her arrest. That clock was paused temporarily until Thursday’s hearing, but is now running. Following a rejection by a grand jury, prosecutors can attempt again to seek an indictment as many times as they want with Pirro’s permission. Alternatively, they could charge Reid with a lower-level misdemeanor offense that does not require indictment.</p>
<p>Harvey ordered the parties to return to court on Friday afternoon to resume the preliminary hearing. Reid’s attorneys have asked him to decline to find probable cause and dismiss the case against her entirely.</p>
