<p>SALT LAKE CITY (KUTV) — Salt Lake's music community rallied around one of their own who was detained by ICE.</p>
<p>John Shin, a violinist who received Bachelor's and Master's degrees at the University of Utah for violin performance, was detained on Monday. He reportedly only had a 30-second phone call to explain what was going on.</p>
<p>"I don't know anything about the specifics of his case, but I was kind of shocked. John is a husband and a father and has been working not only in the arts but in other jobs as well since he graduated from college," said Robert Baldwin, a former teacher of Shin's at the University of Utah.</p>

<p>Baldwin is also the conductor of both the Salt Lake Symphony and Sinfonia Salt Lake, where Shin plays the violin.</p>
<p>"He's worked really hard to make an impact and be a part of that community and be involved not only with, you know, just playing music but also just engaged with the teaching and with all of the different types of things you can do as an artist bringing music to audiences," Baldwin said. "John is a really unique individual. And I knew that as soon as he showed up as a young freshman and it's continued to develop to this day. He's very serious. He is dedicated and committed, and he also has an awful lot of fun. He definitely enjoys the aspect of making music and just dives into it. I've never seen, or rarely [have] seen people get so excited about doing a particular piece of music," Baldwin said.</p>
<p>He said Shin has also played for the Utah Symphony and is a children's violin teacher.</p>
<p>A Facebook post from Shin's wife detailed how he was detained. In part, it read: "On Monday, at 2:30pm I got a call from John-- 'Honey, I don't have much time. I've been arrested by ICE and they are sending me to a detainment center. I love you and the kids, I will be okay, please call our attorney' and then he was rushed off the phone. I have no more details, no more information than those short 30 seconds."</p>
<p>2News reached out to the ICE detention center in Aurora, Colorado, and got confirmation that a man named John Shin from South Korea was being detained there.</p>
<p>"As musicians, we work very closely together. We get to know each other and very intimately if you will — the idea that we're sharing emotions, we're sharing struggles to present music and bring everything together and knowing John through is student years as well, this really hits hard not only for me but in the entire music community," Baldwin said. "I think that's why you see the outpouring not only of the initial anger and frustration that this has happened, but also the support that people want to give to John and to his family."</p>
<p>The family has set up a GoFundMe to help with Shin's legal fees as they figure this out, and are asking anyone who knew him to help write character letters their lawyer can present to the judge.</p>
<p>KUTV reached out to the family and is waiting to hear back. KUTV also reached out to ICE to ask about Shin's immigration status.</p>
