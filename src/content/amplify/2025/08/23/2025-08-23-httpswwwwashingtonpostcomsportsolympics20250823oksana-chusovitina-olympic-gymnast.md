<p>Oksana Chusovitina made her international debut more than three decades ago for the Soviet Union. She’s still hoping to compete in three years in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>In June, a day after she turned 50, Oksana Chusovitina launched herself eight feet into the air, then flipped backward with a full twist and landed on her feet to <a href="https://www.olympics.com/en/news/50-year-old-oksana-chusovitina-claims-vault-silver-at-home-world-challenge-cup">win a silver medal </a>on vault at a World Challenge Cup event in her home city of Tashkent, Uzbekistan. It wasn’t even the gymnast’s best vault of the year. That came weeks earlier, when an extra half-twist and near-perfect landing <a href="https://www.olympics.com/en/news/ageless-oksana-chusovitina-wins-vault-competition-2025-baku-world-cup">got her the gold</a> at a World Cup event in Baku.</p>
