Photo by Radley Balko)</figcaption></figure>
<p>I first met Paul House in 2011 when I visited he and his mother here in Tennessee for a story I was working on.</p>
<p><a href="https://reason.com/2011/06/07/wrongful-convictions/">Here’s what I wrote</a> after that visit.</p>
<blockquote><p>When Paul House was finally released from prison in 2008, he was a specter of the man who had been sentenced to death more than 22 years earlier. When I visit his home in Crossville, Tennessee, in March, House’s mother Joyce, who has cared for him since his release, points to a photo of House taken the day he was finally allowed to come home. In that photo and others from his last days in prison, House is all of 150 pounds, ashen and drawn, his fragile frame nearly consumed by his wheelchair. In most of the images he looks days away from death, although in one he wears the broad smile of a man finally escaping a long confinement.</p><p>When House’s aunt called to congratulate him on his first day back, his mother handed him her cell phone so he could chat. He inspected the phone, gave her a frustrated look, and asked her to find him one that worked.</p><p>“Paul’s first meal when he got home was chili verde,” Joyce House says. “It’s his favorite. And I had been waiting a long time to make it for him." And apparently quite a few meals after that. House, now 49, has put on 75 pounds since his release. More important, he has been getting proper treatment for his advanced-stage multiple sclerosis, treatment the Tennessee prison system hadn’t given him.</p><p>The years of inadequate care have taken a toll. House can’t walk, and he needs help with such basic tasks as bathing, feeding himself, and maneuvering around in his wheelchair. His once distinctively deep voice (which had allegedly been heard by a witness at the crime scene) is now wispy and high-pitched. He spends his time playing computer games and watching game shows.</p><p>In the hour or so that I visit with House, his mental facilities fade in and out. Communicating with him can be like trying to listen to a baseball game broadcast by a distant radio station. He will give a slurred but lucid answer to one question, then answer the next one with silence, or with the answer to a previous question, or just with a random assortment of words. He frequently falls back on the resigned refrain, “Oh, well,” delivered with a shrug. The gesture and phrasing are identical every time he uses them. It’s what House says to kill the expectation that he will be able to deliver the words others in the room are waiting for. It’s his signal to stop waiting for him and move on.</p></blockquote>
<p>House passed away in April. He was 63. He got to enjoy 16 years of freedom, though those years were hobbled by his MS, which the prison system was both late to diagnose and deficient in treating. House was never compensated for his time in prison, or for the state’s attempt to execute him. Under Tennessee law, a wrongly convicted person can’t be compensated until they are formally exonerated by the governor. That never happened with House. So he lived out his life in a modest home in Crossville, Tennessee, under the care of his devoted mother, Joyce.</p>
<p>Even that took a legal miracle, including a precedent-setting Supreme Court ruling that allowed his innocence petition to proceed, even as it closed the door on many others.</p>
<p>House was the first person to take advantage of the Supreme Court’s <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/2013/05/opinion-analysis-innocence-exception-survives-innocence-claim-does-not/">“innocence gateway,”</a> which allows prisoners who can prove their actual innocence to circumvent the onerous restrictions that prevent federal courts from reviewing most state convictions. Under today’s Supreme Court, House would probably never have been released. And the way Tennessee is executing people these days, he may well have been put to death. His story highlights the courts’ relative indifference to the systemic failures exposed by DNA technology.</p>
<p>House was convicted of killing Carolyn Muncey in 1985 in Luttrell, Tennessee. House was an outsider in the town, having only recently moved into the area. He got into bar fights with locals, particularly after it got out that he had moved to the state after serving five years in a Utah prison for sexual assault. House has said this too was a wrongful accusation, but given the potentially long sentence he faced, he took a plea bargain on the advice of his attorney.</p>
<p>Muncey and her husband were House’s neighbors in Luttrell and, despite his difficulties with others in the town, House considered them friends. He became a suspect in Muncey’s death when a witness claimed to have seen him on an embankment near the couple’s home on the night of the murder.</p>
<p>The state also presented three other core pieces of evidence for House’s guilt. The first was that when the police detained him, House lied about how he got some scratches on his arms. He first claimed they were from his girlfriend’s cats. He then said that he had gotten into a fight that night while out on a walk with some of the same local men who had been harassing him. “I think it was a situation where you're on parole, you’re an outsider, and this woman has just been killed near where you live,” House’s attorney told me in 2011. “It wasn't smart of him to lie to the police. But it was understandable.”</p>
<p>The second piece of evidence was semen found on Muncey’s nightgown. DNA testing wasn’t available at the time, but police claimed the semen was a match to House’s blood type. House had Type A blood — as does about 36 percent of the country. House was also a “secretor,” meaning he produced antigens in other bodily fluids that indicated his blood type. About 80 percent of the population are secretors. In other words, combined, the blood type and secretor evidence indicated that the semen could have come from House — but it also could have come with about 29 percent of the male population.</p>
<p>There was also no evidence that Muncey had been raped, a fact that should have excluded the semen evidence. Perversely, the fact that Muncey <em>wasn’t</em> raped would later be used <em>against</em> House when he challenged his conviction in court.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most compelling evidence against House was that police claimed to have found blood on the jeans House was wearing on the night Muncey was murdered that matched her blood type, but not his. But as we’ll see, this evidence would soon come into question, too.</p>

<p>After House was convicted and sentenced to death, he had difficulty finding an attorney to represent him in his state post-conviction claims. So he filed a <em>pro se</em> post-conviction petition, alleging ineffective of assistance of counsel and challenging the jury instructions at his trial. That claim was rejected. Tennessee courts also rejected his second attempt at a <em>pro se</em> post-conviction petition.</p>
<p>Like most states, Tennessee makes it extremely difficult to get back into court once you’ve lost your post-conviction petition. This is particularly a problem if you don’t have a legal team to review your claims, review your trial attorney’s performance, and investigate your case.</p>
<p>House’s case then moved to the federal courts. Under Supreme Court precedent, and under the 1996 Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA), when a prisoner has defaulted on post-conviction claims in state court — for example, by missing a filing deadline, or by failing to introduce evidence at trial — the federal courts must defer to the state court’s decisions, even if federal judges believe the state courts got it wrong. Federal courts can only overturn state courts if they believe the state court wasn’t just wrong, but so wrong that “no reasonable jurist could reasonably disagree.”</p>
<p>At this point, as with most death row prisoners, House was finally able to get representation. The cruel irony is that this is also when it’s most difficult to get a court to review your case on the merits.</p>
<p>House’s attorneys began investigating, and found compelling evidence of his innocence. They first obtained affidavits from witnesses who said Muncey’s husband was an alcoholic who frequently abused her. Two said he had confessed to killing her. One even went to police to report him, but was brushed aside. Another said Muncey’s husband asked her to lie to support his alibi.</p>
<p>House’s lawyers next obtained DNA testing on the semen found on Muncey’s nightgown. The results showed that it did <em>not</em> come from House.</p>
<p>But the state continued to defend the conviction and death sentence. The state claimed the DNA testing was irrelevant because House was never charged with raping Muncey. This was misleading at best. The blood type and secretor evidence were the reason House became the lead suspect. And while it’s true that House was never charged with rape — because there was no evidence of it — jurors were still told that House’s blood type was the same as the semen in Muncey’s nightgown. It’s preposterous to think it had no influence on them.</p>
<p>Here, for example, is an excerpt from the prosecutor’s closing argument:</p>
<blockquote><p>Now you may have an idea why he did it. The evidence at the scene which seemed to suggest that he was subjecting the lady to some kind of indignity, why would you get a lady out of her house, late at night, in her night clothes, under the trick that her husband has had a wreck down by the creek? Why is it that you want to get her down by the creek? .... [I]t is either to keep her from telling what you have done to her, or it is that you are trying to get her to do something that she nor any mother on that road would want to do with Mr. House .... and you kill her because of her resistance.</p></blockquote>
<p>In response to House’s new evidence, prosecutors hung their case on the blood allegedly found on House’s jeans. Like the semen, the blood evidence had since been tested for DNA — and those tests showed that it was indeed Carolyn Muncey’s blood.</p>
<p>But there was an explanation for that. At a 1999 evidentiary hearing, a Tennessee state medical examiner testified that the chemical composition of the blood on House’s jeans indicated it was blood that had been taken <em>after</em> Muncey had been autopsied. House’s attorneys contended that it must have spilled from the test tube onto House’s jeans at some point in the handling of the evidence — or even that it might have been planted.</p>
<p>That might sound farfetched. But here’s where things get really crazy. House’s attorneys also discovered that the test tube of Muncey's blood had been improperly transported in the same Styrofoam box as House’s jeans. Between the time of Muncey’s autopsy and the time all the evidence arrived at the FBI crime lab for testing, three-fourths of the blood sample taken after Muncey’s autopsy was missing.</p>
<p>Here’s how the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit <a href="https://caselaw.findlaw.com/court/us-6th-circuit/1342248.html">described the blood evidence</a> in 2002:</p>
<blockquote><p>Dr. Blake concluded that the enzymes in the blood on the jeans changed shape and degraded at the same rate as the blood in the sample taken from the victim’s body after her death. Because they degraded at the same rate despite being in two different media, it appears that the enzymes came from the same sample, that is, the blood on the defendant’s jeans came from the one of the vials of blood taken from the victim. The blood on the jeans did not come from the victim at the time that she was assaulted.</p></blockquote>
<p>There was also evidence of tampering. Again from the Sixth Circuit:</p>
<blockquote><p>In addition to the similarity in enzymatic activity, House presented evidence suggesting that the sample in the vials of blood may have been tampered with or spilled onto the blue jeans. As Dr. Blake noted, there was no unbroken chain of custody. Larry Johnson, an expert in crime scene investigation, similarly stated that “the packaging of the materials in the case did not meet professional standards.” House also showed that there was blood missing from the sample taken — one of the four vials was empty and another is only half-full despite Agent Bigbee’s testimony that he used only one-fourth of a vial in performing his tests at the FBI lab. House then introduced the photograph of the styrofoam container clearly showing that blood spilled in the container and that the tape on the container was mysteriously cut and re-taped contrary to standard procedure.</p></blockquote>
<p>The blood stains on House’s jeans were also mixed with mud. The problem is that it hadn’t rained for at least three days prior to the murder, and there was no mud on Muncey’s nightown.</p>
<p>AEDPA requires prisoners to exhaust all of their state claims before a federal court can even consider the case. So the Sixth Circuit sent the case back to the Tennessee Supreme Court, and asked it to consider if this new evidence would allow House to get back into state court.</p>
<p>The state’s high court refused to even consider House’s claims. The justices ruled that House’s two prior post-conviction petitions barred him from a third. Even though this exonerating evidence was new, undiscoverable at the time of trial, and involved DNA — the trifecta of what courts tend to look for in such cases — Tennessee did not permit prisoners to get back into state court once they had failed on a post-conviction petition, even if the new evidence could establish their innocence.</p>
<p>So House then moved to the federal courts. AEDPA and Supreme Court precedent require federal courts to show extreme deference not only to the decisions state courts make on the merits of a case, they must also defer to states’ procedural rules, even when those rules <a href="https://radleybalko.substack.com/p/the-maddening-irrelevance-of-charlie">are unfair and unjust. </a></p>
<p>But the Supreme Court did create one narrow exception. In the 1996 case <em><a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/513/298/">Schlup v. Delo</a></em>, the court ruled that even if a prisoner had exhausted or defaulted on his post-conviction claims in state court, the federal courts could consider a “freestanding” innocence claim if said prisoner had evidence that would establish innocence. But the bar here is incredibly high — so high, in fact, that not a single prisoner had managed to take advantage of the decision between <em>Schlup </em>in 1996 and when the court took up House’s case in 2006.</p>
<p>To get through this innocence gateway, a prisoner must present “new reliable evidence — whether it be exculpatory scientific evidence, trustworthy eyewitness accounts, or critical physical evidence — that was not presented at trial” and “must show that it is more likely than not that no reasonable juror would have convicted him in the light of the new evidence.”</p>

<p>House’s new petition first went to a federal district court judge, who rejected all of his claims. The judge didn’t find the eyewitness accounts of the confessions from Muncey’s husband to be credible, and didn’t find the explanation of how Muncey’s blood got on House’s pants to be persuasive. Instead, the judge relied on the state’s expert on blood spatter analysis — a dubious field of forensics — who said that the blood on House’s jeans suggested he was wearing the pants when the blood was transferred.</p>
<p>The case was then heard against by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. In 2004, that sharply divided court <a href="https://caselaw.findlaw.com/court/us-6th-circuit/1459316.html">ruled 8-7 against House</a>, for largely the same reasons as the district court judge. The U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear the case in 2006 — which was John Roberts’s first term as chief justice.</p>
<p>The court <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/145648/house-v-bell/">ruled 5-3 in favor of House</a>. Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote the majority opinion. After thoroughly reviewing the record, Kennedy concluded that House had presented enough evidence — narrowly — to take advantage of the innocence gateway. But Kennedy also made clear that House had just squeaked by.</p>
<p>Roberts wrote a dissenting opinion, joined by justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas. Roberts’s opinion also included a detailed review of the record, but he came down on the opposite side of Kennedy, concluding, “I do not find it probable that no reasonable juror would vote to convict him.”</p>
<p>Roberts would have kept House on death row, leaving Tennessee free to execute him. His main argument was that federal appellate courts an only overturn the evidentiary findings of federal district court judges when there is “clear error.” Roberts was not convinced that the district court judge had committed an error.</p>
<p>Roberts’s dissent would have made it extremely difficult for the wrongly convicted to get any federal review at all. If a state court rules on the merits of a claim, the federal courts are required to defer to that ruling unless they find the state court’s ruling so wrong that the judge who wrote it is essentially unfit for the bench. If a state court never adjudicates the merits of a claim because the defendant is barred by procedural rules, the federal courts must also defer to those procedural rules.</p>
<p>The only exception to all of this is the innocence gateway. But that requires the wrongly convicted person to essentially prove their innocence beyond a reasonable doubt. And short of DNA testing — and even then — that’s a very difficult thing to do. There’s a presumption of finality and deference to the jury’s verdict.</p>
<p>It’s important to emphasize here that these are all constitutional claims. The founders explicitly made federal judges lifetime appointments because they didn’t believe that constitutional rights should be tainted by political influence and the pressure to win reelection. Yet the Supreme Court has basically outsourced enforcement of the Bill of Rights to state appellate court judges, many of whom are elected (Tennessee justices are appointed, then face retention elections).</p>
<p>The Supreme Court’s ruling in <em>House v. Bell</em> did not immediately free Paul House. Instead, the majority said that the lower courts had to consider the new DNA evidence on the merits. The Sixth Circuit eventually did that, and orverturned House’s conviction in 2006. House was released.</p>
<p>But Paul Phillips, the prosecutor who put House on death row, announced he would try House again. So House was re-arrested and re-incarcerated. More than a year later, an understandably irritated federal district court judge gave Phillips 180 days to either retry House or set him free.</p>
<p>Phillips continued to delay. After the 180 days elapsed, the Sixth Circuit suspended the district court’s deadline, and granted Phillips an extension (a notable contrast to the rigid manner in which federal courts enforce deadlines on prisoners in these cases).</p>

<p>At a bail hearing in May 2008 — a year and-a-half after the Supreme Court ruled that House had satisfied the innocence gateway — Phillips’s office continued to argue that House should remain in jail pending his new trial because he was both a flight risk and a threat to the community.</p>
<p>This wasn’t just cruel, it was laughable. By that time, House relied on a wheelchair that he was unable to maneuver on his own. He was not a flight risk. Prosecutors then argued that because House was still able to feed himself with a fork (with much difficulty), he was still a threat to stab someone with it.</p>
<p>House’s bail was ultimately set at $100,000. In the summer of 2008 a donor paid the bail, and he was finally freed.</p>
<p>Phillips would eventually have two additional pieces of biological evidence tested for DNA: a hair found at the crime scene, and some blood found under Carolyn Muncey’s fingernails. It’s curious that this evidence became available only once the prosecution was on the ropes. House’s defense team had asked for years that any remaining biological evidence be tested. They were told that either there was no such evidence, or that the state had misplaced it.</p>
<p>Philips told the A.P. at the time that if the new tests didn’t implicate House he would, at long last, drop the murder charge. In February 2009 the results came back. They did not implicate House. But they also didn’t implicate Muncey’s husband. They instead pointed to a third, unidentified man. It’s possible that <em>everyone</em> was wrong.</p>
<p>The tests on the material under Muncey’s fingernails also removed the last shoddy plank propping up the state’s case: the scratch marks on House’s arms. This was really the only remaining piece of circumstantial evidence against him. If the scratches had been defensive wounds inflicted by Mancey, at least some of that material should have matched House’s DNA profile. It did not. Phillips finally dropped the charges, though not before stating one last time that he believed House was “involved in some way” in Muncey’s murder.</p>
<p>House’s release was at least some measure of justice. But the prison system’s neglect of his disease meant his remaining years would be difficult. His mother Joyce had suspected her son was ill long before his diagnosis. She finally demanded he be seen by prison medical staff after an incident in the late 1990s.</p>
<p>“I was visiting him, and I brought along some microwave popcorn,” she told me in 2011. “He asked me to heat it up, and I said, ‘No, you heat it up.’ When he got up, he had to prop himself up and drag along the wall to get to the microwave. He couldn’t even stand up straight.”</p>
<p>By the time House was finally diagnosed with M.S. in 2000, his symptoms were severe. Joyce would later learn that other death row prisoners had been <a href="https://theintercept.com/2020/02/16/tennessee-death-row-nicholas-sutton-execution/">carrying him to her visitation sessions with him</a> because he could no longer walk. He had asked them not to tell her because he didn’t want her to worry.</p>
<p>There was ample evidence of House’s innocence at that evidentiary hearing in 1999. It was the recalcitrance of Tennessee officials and the indifference of state and federal courts that kept him incarcerated for another nine years. After he was out, House’s doctors told him that the Tennessee prison system’s failure to diagnose his M.S. earlier, and to treat it properly after it was diagnosed, would likely take years off his life. And of course it also significantly diminished the quality of what life he had left.</p>
<p>In the years since its ruling in <em>House v. Bell</em>, the Roberts court has only made it more difficult for prisoners to get their convictions reviewed in federal court. The “innocence gateway” still technically exists, but only a vanishing few have been able to take advantage of it. Without DNA evidence, it’s nearly impossible. The legal scholar Brandon Garrett has found that most people eventually exonerated by DNA were unable to take advantage of the gateway under <em>Schlup. </em>The court’s stop-gap to catch innocence cases has never done much to actually catch them.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the court has also continued to restrict prisoners’ access to the courts through traditional habeas petitions. Most prisoners can’t get access to exculpatory and exonerating evidence, particularly without a lawyer. Under the court’s current jurisprudence, you essentially need to “prove” your innocence in order to get a federal evidentiary hearing to see the evidence that could prove your innocence — a neat little paradox that laughs in the face of justice.</p>
<p>If that weren’t bad enough, the court then ruled in 2022 — in the infamous <a href="https://theintercept.com/2022/05/28/barry-jones-supreme-court-arizona-shinn-martinez/">“innocence isn’t enough”</a> case — that federal courts are prohibited from considering any exculpatory evidence revealed in those hearings, again mocking any reasonable notion of fairness or justice.</p>
<p>It seems likely that if today’s Supreme Court had been in place when Paul House’s case came before them in 2006, he’d have died on death row — or been executed. The 5-3 majority in his case included justices Anthony Kennedy, who has since been replaced by Neal Gorsuch, and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who has since been replaced by Amy Coney Barrett. (Justice Alito had just been confirmed, and didn’t take part in the decision.)</p>
<p>One might think that Roberts’s opinion auguring for the guilt of a man who turned out to be innocent would be cause for some reflection. But it’s far from the only time the court’s conservative justices have declared the guilt of someone later shown to be innocent. In 1986 <a href="https://www.findlaw.com/legalblogs/supreme-court/dna-sets-man-free-after-scalia-mocked-his-death-penalty-appeal/">Justice Antonin Scalia cited</a> the North Carolina convictions of brothers <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_McCollum_and_Leon_Brown">Henry McCollum and Leon Brown</a> as an example of the sort of heinous crime that compels the continued use of capital punishment. When McCollum’s case later came before the court, Scalia voted not to hear it at all. The brothers were exonerated by DNA testing in 2014.</p>
<p>Perhaps no Supreme Court justice has been on the wrong side of more wrongful convictions than Clarence Thomas. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/06/01/arizona-death-row-supreme-court-shinn-innocence/">It was Thomas</a> who wrote the majority opinion in the infamous “innocence isn’t enough” case in 2022. The prisoner at the heart of that case — Barry Jones — <a href="https://theintercept.com/2023/06/17/barry-jones-released-arizona-death-row/">is now free</a>, thanks in large part to the razor thin margin that elected a Democrat as attorney general in Arizona in 2024.</p>
<p>None of this has chastened Thomas, who has emphatically stated that nothing in the Constitution prevents the execution of an innocent person. Two years ago <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/clarence-thomas-rodney-reed-supreme-court-rcna80978">he railed against</a> the innocence claim of Texas death row prisoner Rodney Reed. He has also belittled the innocence claims of <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/clarence-thomass-astonishing-opinion-on-a-racist-mississippi-prosecutor">Curtis Flowers</a> and <a href="https://www.johntfloyd.com/justice-clarence-thomas-belittles-evidence-of-actual-innocence-of-man-condemned-to-death/">Richard Glossip</a>. In the latter, Thomas <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2024/10/clarence-thomas-kill-richard-glossip-supreme-court-arguments.html">seemed more concerned</a> about the reputations of misbehaving prosecutors <a href="https://theintercept.com/2025/06/20/richard-glossip-bond-hearing-oklahoma-murder/">than the innocence</a> of a man on death row.</p>
<p><a href="https://davisvanguard.org/2025/06/justice-thomas-dissent-capital-punishment/">Earlier this year</a>, Thomas wrote that there is no due process right under the Constitution to post-conviction proceedings at all. He has also written that death row prisoners should be executed more quickly, and has denied compensation to the wrongly convicted. Thomas <a href="https://ballsandstrikes.org/law-politics/supreme-court-gideon-v-wainwright-conservative-legal-movement/">has also suggested</a> repealing <em>Gideon v. Wainwright</em>, the ruling that guarantees indigent defendants the right to counsel.</p>
<p>The enduring lesson of the revolution in DNA technology should have been that we have a badly flawed system in dire need of reform and oversight. The lesson the Roberts court seems to have drawn is that the integrity of our system rests on prioritizing the finality of jury verdicts, on putting our faith in state justice systems that have done little to earn that trust — on not asking too many questions.</p>
<p>Or, as Paul House might have put it, the court’s attitude toward innocence appears to be, “Oh well.”</p>
