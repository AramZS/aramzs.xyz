This is the highest level on record, and the fourth successive year that bosses’ pay has increased.</p><div><p>The level of </p><a href="https://archive.is/o/es4bc/https://www.ft.com/executive-pay" target="_blank">pay</a><p> for S&amp;P 500 executives has drawn scrutiny from groups that question whether it is exacerbating inequality. </p></div><p>The American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations, a national trade union, flagged Niccol’s pay package as an example of the widest pay gap between the top executive and median employee of one of the biggest US companies. </p><p>Niccol’s annual pay was more than 6,666 times greater than the total pay for the median employee, a part-time barista, who earns about $15,000 a year, according to company filings. </p><p>“We just see ever-growing income inequality in this country, and it’s becoming harder and harder for workers to make ends meet,” said Carin Zelenko, director of capital strategies at AFL-CIO.</p><p>Sarah Anderson, global economy project director for the non-profit research group Institute for Policy Studies, said the widening gap between chief executive and worker pay was bad for democracy. </p><p>“This gap between CEO and worker pay is a key driver of rising inequality and concentration of wealth at the top. We’re seeing more and more signs of how ultra-wealthy people have too much influence over our political system,” she said. </p><p>Still, the larger pay ratio between an employee and a chief executive may also reflect a company’s business model. A retail boss is likely to have a wider pay ratio than a technology chief executive who usually hires engineers who are full-time workers.</p><p>Nvidia, the most valuable US company, reported a chief executive to median employee pay ratio of 166 to 1, with its median employee earning $301,233 compared with CEO Jensen Huang’s total pay of $49.9mn in 2024. </p><figure><picture><source height="2500" media="(min-width: 700px)" old-srcset="https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/ftcms%3A63a0da9f-a0f5-4df8-893a-fd35a5e488ca?source=next-article&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=700&amp;dpr=1 1x,https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/ftcms%3A63a0da9f-a0f5-4df8-893a-fd35a5e488ca?source=next-article&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=700&amp;dpr=2 2x,https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/ftcms%3A63a0da9f-a0f5-4df8-893a-fd35a5e488ca?source=next-article&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=700&amp;dpr=3 3x,https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/ftcms%3A63a0da9f-a0f5-4df8-893a-fd35a5e488ca?source=next-article&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=700&amp;dpr=4 4x,https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/ftcms%3A63a0da9f-a0f5-4df8-893a-fd35a5e488ca?source=next-article&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=700&amp;dpr=5 5x" width="3500"/><source height="2000" media="(max-width: 490px)" old-srcset="https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/ftcms%3A3ed8b75a-82f8-4134-8f0a-10499dd0c1c9?source=next-article&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=490&amp;dpr=1 1x,https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/ftcms%3A3ed8b75a-82f8-4134-8f0a-10499dd0c1c9?source=next-article&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=490&amp;dpr=2 2x,https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/ftcms%3A3ed8b75a-82f8-4134-8f0a-10499dd0c1c9?source=next-article&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=490&amp;dpr=3 3x" width="1500"/><img alt="Line chart of Median say on pay support at S&amp;P 500 companies (%) showing Shareholder support for executive pay dips but remains strong" currentsourceurl="https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/ftcms%3A63a0da9f-a0f5-4df8-893a-fd35a5e488ca?source=next-article&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=700&amp;dpr=1" loading="lazy" src="https://d8xwh5vma949bg.archive.is/es4bc/c48de74279005b44a5cf1fa48b87535ac0a95d0b.avif"/></picture></figure><p>Meanwhile, shareholder support for executive pay packages has remained strong.
