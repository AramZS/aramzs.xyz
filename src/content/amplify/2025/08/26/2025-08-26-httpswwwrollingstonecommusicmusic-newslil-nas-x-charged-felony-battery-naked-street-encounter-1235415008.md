<p>Lli Nas X is facing four felony charges after <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/lil-nas-x-arrested-battery-police-officer-1235413724/">allegedly charging at Los Angeles police officers</a> in Studio City last week.</p>
<p>The musician (real name Montero Lamar Hill) was charged with three counts of battery with injury on a police officer and one count of resisting an executive officer, the Los Angeles District Attorney’s Office confirmed to <em>Rolling Stone</em>. Hill is set to be arraigned today, Aug. 25. His reps did not immediately return a request for comment.</p>
<p>Hill was arrested after being found early last Friday morning, around 6 a.m. local time, walking on Ventura Boulevard, a major thoroughfare in Studio City, in his underwear and a pair of white cowboy boots. Video of the incident, shared with TMZ, appeared to show Hill speaking incoherently to the person filming him.</p>
<p>According to the police, when they arrived on the scene, Hill “charged” at the officers when they tried to confront him. Police initially <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/lil-nas-x-hospitalized-possible-overdose-1235413370/">transported Hill to a nearby hospital</a> for a possible overdose. He spent several hours there before being taken to jail, where he spent the weekend.</p>
<p>Prior to his arrest, Hill had sparked concern with a series of bizarre posts on his Instagram page, after deleting all earlier posts two days before. Last Wednesday, he shared unreleased music alongside mirror selfies, his art, and piles of junk in what appeared to be his home.</p>
<p>Hill has also been hospitalized already once this year. Back in April, he posted a video from a hospital bed, saying he had suffered from <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/lil-nas-x-hospitalized-partial-facial-paralysis-1235317882/">partial facial paralysis</a>, though he never shared publicly what caused the incident.</p>
