  Increases in technology use, among youth and adults, are concerning given the
  volume of information produced and disseminated in the modern world.
  Conceptual models have been developed to understand how people manage the
  large volume of information encountered during intentional learning activities
  with technology. What, if anything, do people learn when they happen upon news
  and other information while using technology for purposes other than learning?
  Questions like this highlight the need to understand incidental learning,
  i.e., learning that occurs when people, who are pursuing a goal other than
  learning such as entertainment, encounter information that leads to a change
  in thinking or behavior. In this article, we integrate theory and research
  from multiple scholarly literatures into the Technology Incidental Learning
  Effects (TILE) model, which provides a framework for future research on how
  incidental learning occurs and what factors affect this process. Current
  research on incidental learning can be informed by educational psychology
  scholarship on dual-processing, motivation, interest, source evaluation, and
  knowledge reconstruction. The TILE model points to many promising future
  directions for research with direct implications for modern society, including
  the need to better understand how and why people move from merely noticing to
  engaging with incidentally exposed information as well as how to help people
  successfully manage the large amounts of information they encounter when using
  technology for purposes other than learning.
