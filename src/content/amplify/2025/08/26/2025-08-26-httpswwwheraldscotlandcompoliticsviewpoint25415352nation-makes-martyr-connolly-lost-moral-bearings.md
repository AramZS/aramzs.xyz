<p>BURN them in their hotels, she said. And try to burn them in their hotels they did.</p>
<p>On July 29 last year, Lucy Connolly wrote on the social media platform X: “Mass deportation now. Set fire to all the f****** hotels full of the b*****ds for all I care.”</p>
<p>On August 4 in Rotherham, a far-right mob tried to burn down a hotel housing 200 asylum seekers. Sentencing one of the rioters, a judge said the intention was “to endanger the lives of many people trapped in the hotel”.</p>
<p>Connolly is now deified as a martyr by swathes of the British press and leading politicians.</p>
<p>She pleaded guilty to inciting racial hatred. Sentenced to 31 months, she’s been released after just ten and feted as a “political prisoner”.</p>
<p>In a sane, normal country, Connolly would be treated as a contemptible extremist. Not in Britain. But then this is no longer a sane, normal country.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.heraldscotland.com/topics/nigel-farage/">Nigel Farage</a> wrote on X: “Welcome to freedom, Lucy Connolly.” Tory leader Kemi Badenoch wrote: “Lucy Connolly finally returns home to her family today. At last.”</p>
<p>Now imagine how either of those politicians might react if this was a Muslim or left-wing prisoner, released early after calling for people to be burned. Imagine what the media would say?</p>
<p>Britain has lost its moral bearings. To offer any succour to someone like Connolly is to revile decency, humanity and respect for the law.</p>
<p>But we are a nation unhinged. Connolly was tweeting about something that was a far-right conspiracy. The killer in the Southport attack was British, not an immigrant.</p>

<p>We now see the real world consequences on our streets of years of dangerous political rhetoric, stoked by the media. There’s an atmosphere of intimidation and threat. Immigrants and Britons of colour feel afraid.</p>
<p>Is this the country we’re meant to be? Is that what patriotism is supposed to look like?</p>
<p>It feels as if Britain has gone through the looking glass. Or perhaps it’s better to say that it feels as if those in power, those who rule us, have happily allowed themselves to go through the looking glass and drag the rest of Britain behind them.</p>
<p>They cannot believe that what they’re doing is honourable.</p>
<p>What started with fringe rhetoric from the extremes has now made its way through Reform and into the Conservative and even Labour Party. The press picked up the ball and ran with it; <a href="https://www.heraldscotland.com/topics/television/">TV</a> news followed along behind, most notably the BBC.</p>
<p>This madness, however, flows only from a small sliver of the population. While many voters are concerned about immigration, few take to the streets.</p>
<p>Anti-asylum protests this weekend were given huge coverage but were small. Some estimates claimed that across the entire country there were only a few thousand demonstrators in total. By comparison, last month’s London Pride march had 100,000. Coverage is unbalanced.</p>
<p>Reports said that in some towns demonstrators “could barely muster enough people to cover the pavement”. The Observer noted that “only a few dozen anti-migrant activists showed up for a march through Liverpool … They were outnumbered by at least 300 counter-protestors from Stand Up to Racism”.</p>

<p>In Perth, there were about 150 protestors with signs reading “Get them out”, but 200 anti-racist demonstrators with their owns signs like “no to racism” and “refugees welcome”.</p>
<p>Perth and Kinross deputy council leader Eric Drysdale said he felt that the majority of the anti-asylum protestors “were not from Perth … I think they have been bussed in”.</p>
<p>The storyline that’s been built paints Connolly as an average mum with “legitimate concerns” and protestors simply as “worried citizens”.</p>
<p>I know no mothers, or fathers for that matter, who would call for fellow human beings to be burned in hotels. If I did, I’d happily see them do time as well.</p>
<p>While I’m sure there are some ordinary folk among the protestors, there are also many active members of the far-right using this as an opportunity to further their own dangerous aims.</p>
<p>Haven’t we seen the police attacked repeatedly during these demonstrators? Concerned citizens - patriotic citizens - don’t assault officers.</p>
<p>Connolly will likely make a cosy living out of her phoney martyrdom. There are plenty of journalists and influencers who will be willing to present her as something she’s not.</p>
<p>There’s talk of her meeting with representatives of the Trump administration. Farage has said he is going to bring Connolly up when he testifies before the US House Judiciary Committee in September. The committee is to discuss alleged threats to free speech in the UK.</p>
<p>The notion of the Trump administration as some champion of free speech, when it is doing everything it can to crush citizens’ liberties in America, is as absurd as Farage is craven for running to MAGA to whine about his own country.</p>
<p>It’s another imaginary phantom, like two-tier justice. Ministry of Justice data shows that people of “white British” ethnicity are treated more leniently, particularly when it comes to custodial sentences.</p>
<p>What’s so galling is that this isn’t a Scottish phenomenon. This is imported from the English media and the Westminster political system.</p>
<p>For all of Scotland’s many faults, our media doesn’t wallow in racism and fear-mongering around immigrants, and our politicians - mostly - don’t trade in hate, prejudice and conspiracy.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the contagion has spread to Scotland and we must deal with it. That means our political leaders, particularly the First Minister, relentlessly condemning lies and hate. Words matter. We know that now to our cost.</p>
<p>We wouldn’t be in this situation if multiple Tory leaders and our current Prime Minister had found the courage, integrity and honesty to face down inflammatory behaviour from the likes of Reform. But they didn’t have the guts.</p>
<p>They thought the only way to deal with Reform was to out-Farage Farage. That’s why we are where we are. The Tories have already destroyed themselves doing so, now Starmer is taking Labour the same way.</p>
<p>Is that where the entire country goes next? Down a path of destruction paved by extremists and politicians too scared to stand up to them?</p>
<p>If a country has lost its moral compass, how does it find a way back to decency and normality?</p>
