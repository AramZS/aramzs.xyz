<p>Everyone wants to do more with first-party data (1PD). But realizing that aim – across real channels, budgets, and teams – is where most brands can often get stuck.</p>
<p>Here are five practical steps I’ve seen help brands move from ambition to impact.</p>
<h2><strong>Step 1: Start with the business challenge, not the stack</strong></h2>
<p>“We use XYZ tech. What should we do with it?” The most common pitfall when it comes to 1PD is starting with the tech. It’s often already in place, and you’re left trying to retrofit a role for it. This is never going to be a formula for success.</p>
<p>Start with a business challenge, an objective, something you want to change – ideally a hypothesis that you would like to put to the test.</p>
<p>Don’t avoid tech altogether – just don’t let it set the brief. And don’t underestimate the role of ad tech – it’s often overlooked and many brands barely scratch the surface of its capabilities.</p>
<p>Top tip: Know your objective, then map capabilities to it, not the other way round.</p>
<h2><strong>Step 2: Paid media belongs at the 1PD table</strong></h2>
<p>If you’re not in the conversation, you can’t shape the direction. 1PD is often owned by customer relationship management (CRM) or data teams, but a lack of paid media understanding means those teams frequently overlook valuable opportunities.</p>
<p>Paid media is not CRM. It is an amplifier that translates audience strategy into scalable performance – such as exclusions, high-value lookalikes, and value-based bidding. Bringing media into the conversation early ensures your 1PD strategy doesn’t just exist in theory, but drives performance in practice.</p>
<p>Data decisions need a paid-media lens.</p>
<p>Top tip: As a paid media practitioner, you and your agencies know what’s possible and what’s not when it comes to platforms – this invaluable expertise can save huge amounts of misplaced investment and wasted time.</p>
<h2><strong>Step 3: Keep it simple (and measurable)</strong></h2>
<p>An effective proof of concept (PoC) is essential. It’s not just there to test your data and your tech, but it’s also testing your organization – do you have the right people, with the right focus, pointing in the right direction?</p>
<p>You are going to need to educate stakeholders as you go on this journey. There will be misconceptions and misplaced ambitions – so over-communicate and simplify twice as much as you think you need to. This will help you prevent project drift and misalignment.</p>
<p>Be crystal clear on the objective, the single metric that matters, and the success threshold. Build a roadmap to that success and share it with others, but make sure they know that there will be speed bumps along the way.</p>
<p>Top tip: Prove what’s possible, then scale it. Momentum comes from early results that others can believe in.</p>
<h2><strong>Step 4: Close the loop – 1PD is a measurement power-up</strong></h2>
<p>One of the most powerful but underused benefits of first-party data is its ability to close the loop between marketing activity and real business outcomes. When 1PD is set up and used well, it doesn’t just help you target better; it helps you understand what’s working, why it’s working, and what to do next. It becomes the link between action and insight.</p>
<p>With clean, consented, first-party data, you can trace the customer journey more meaningfully. You can move from ‘we think this worked’ to ‘we know what worked, for whom, and why.’ This is what makes 1PD a growth driver, not just a targeting tool.</p>
<p>This is often the hardest step to get right. You need a combination of technical capability, data availability, and operational alignment. Get this right, though, and 1PD becomes the key that unlocks growth.</p>
<p>Top tip: 1PD can’t prove value if it’s measured in isolation – embed it within your measurement framework.</p>
<h2><strong>Step 5: Build a data partnership</strong></h2>
<p>You will find quick wins, but true success comes through partnership.</p>
<p>Understanding your data, knowing your teams, navigating your systems – businesses are complex, and a partner that goes on that journey with you is invaluable.</p>
<p>Create a small, focused group of experts that shares an objective. Be open to the different approaches and diverse perspectives brought by different parties and do what you can to limit roadblocks, or steer around them when they occur.</p>
<p>Work across two horizons: quick wins and long-term change. Know what’s urgent vs systemic, and split your effort accordingly.</p>
<p>Top tip: Share the big picture with your partners and agencies – bring them in and trust them, work through the challenges together, and importantly, share the successes.</p>
<p>Getting 1PD right isn’t about having the most data or the newest tech – it’s about making focused decisions, working with the right people to have the right conversations, and closing the loop between intention and impact.</p>
