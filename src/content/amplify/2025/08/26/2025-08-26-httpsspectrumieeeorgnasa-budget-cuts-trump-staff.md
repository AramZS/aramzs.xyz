<p>“I worked at <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/nasa">NASA</a> proudly for 36 years,” says <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jenn-mason-8239a52/">Jennifer Mason</a>. “I decided to retire after it became clear that the current administration does not value science or federal employees.”</p>
<p>There are thousands of people like Mason right now, leaving not just the <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/">U.S. space agency</a> but jobs in medical research, environmental protection, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/doe-advanced-nuclear-site-permit">energy</a> and elsewhere across government. Mason worked at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, most recently as a technology manager for <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/nasas-lunar-space-station-is-a-greatterrible-idea">Gateway</a>, the first planned space station in lunar orbit and part of the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/moon-landing-2025">Artemis</a> moon-landing campaign. It was rewarding work, Mason says, but the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/white-house">White House</a> <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/2025/05/the-white-house-office-of-management-and-budget-releases-the-presidents-fiscal-year-2026-skinny-budget/">proposed</a> canceling Gateway and cutting about a quarter of NASA’s budget overall—and unless Congress intervenes, science programs could be cut by half. Mason says she had also been active in a <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/image-article/johnson-space-center-out-allied-employee-resource-group/">NASA-supported group</a> for gay, lesbian, and transgender employees and their loved ones, and such groups were shut down in January by <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/ending-radical-and-wasteful-government-dei-programs-and-preferencing/">White House executive order</a>. Put all those factors together, Mason says, and it was time to wrap up a long career.</p>
<p>In some ways, this year’s government cuts resemble a corporate downsizing, intended to eliminate layers of fat and waste. But government is not a corporation, and NASA’s purpose is sometimes as much symbolic as it is practical. So the administration’s actions have raised major issues. What shape does NASA take now? Can it continue as a driver, and expression, of American leadership? Will it be leaner and more effective, or will it be too hollowed-out to pursue its many missions?</p>
<p>In the often-sterile language of government, NASA is going through a <a href="https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/workforce-restructuring/reductions-in-force-rif/#:~:text=The%20agency%20lists%20the%20name%20of%20each,is%20at%20the%20bottom%20of%20the%20register.">RIF</a>, short for “reduction in force,” and as part of it, many employees were offered a <a href="https://searchpub.nssc.nasa.gov/servlet/sm.web.Fetch/Exploring%20Separation%20Options%20%28Without%20Retiring%29%20DRP%2C%20VSIP%2C%20and%20Your%20Benefits%20.pdf?rhid=1000&amp;did=7062699&amp;type=released">DRP</a>, short for “deferred resignation program.” It puts most signers on paid leave until early January so they can look for new jobs. NASA says about 4,000 people, or one-fifth of its total workforce, have taken DRP offers.</p>
<p>Mason turned the DRP down: “I did not want to be on extended administrative leave and risk my paycheck if I choose to speak out against Trump’s priorities.”</p>
<h2>Where Will NASA Employees Go?</h2>
<p>While debate goes on about American space goals, there is the more immediate issue of what will happen to those roughly 4,000 people. Some will probably find jobs in private-sector aerospace, defense, or university research; some may move into other engineering fields. Many, like Mason, may retire, years before they might otherwise have planned.</p>
<p>Apparently, nobody is quite sure what the breakdown is likely to be, or at least willing to talk publicly about post-NASA employment trends. “Good data is hard to come by,” says a source who, like many others, did not want to be quoted by name. Data from before 2025 show high demand for people in the space sector; companies like <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/blue-origin">Blue Origin</a>, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/spacex">SpaceX</a>, and newer <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/startups">startups</a> have been growing while NASA shrinks. The nonprofit <a href="https://www.spacefoundation.org/2025/04/07/the-space-report-2025-q1-shows-growing-need-for-skilled-labor-in-space-workforce-budget-concerns-for-u-s-space-force-and-highlights-space-pharmaceuticals-investments/">Space Foundation</a> reported in April that over the last decade, employment at space companies increased 27 percent, almost double the 14 percent growth for the private sector overall. The foundation said space industry <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/salaries">salaries</a> were also nearly double the rest of the private sector economy: US $131,000 in 2022, compared to $72,608 nationally.</p>

<p>Engineers who leave NASA are likely to be sought out, not only because of their skills in <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/project-management">project management</a>, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/topic/robotics/">robotics</a>, and other areas, but because so many of their aerospace peers are reaching retirement age. Deloitte, the accounting firm, <a href="https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/aerospace-defense/aerospace-and-defense-industry-outlook.html">wrote in October 2024</a> that “any amount of retirement in the aerospace and defense industry exacerbates existing talent gaps, as retirees take with them a wealth of institutional knowledge.”</p>
<p>“But that doesn’t necessarily translate into these people finding jobs that are aligned with their values,” says <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8m3mRSUAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Colette Delawalla</a>, a doctoral student in <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/psychology">psychology</a> at Emory University who, in February, started an activist group called <a href="https://www.standupforscience.net/">Stand Up for Science</a>. “Where are the positions that allow them to serve the American public?”</p>
<p>NASA management declined an interview request from <em>IEEE Spectrum</em>. “Safety remains a top priority for our agency as we balance the need to become a more streamlined and more efficient organization and work to ensure we remain fully capable of pursuing a Golden Era of exploration and innovation, including to the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/moon">Moon</a> and Mars,” said spokeswoman Cheryl Warner in a statement sent to reporters after the deadline to accept buyout offers passed on 25 July. The White House press office, in response to a request for comment, referred <em>Spectrum</em> back to NASA.</p>
<h2>Cultural Mismatch in Space Careers</h2>
<p>Delawalla says there’s a demographic and philosophical mismatch between private sector space companies and former NASA staff—many of the newer companies are looking for young, aggressive engineers, but many of the people leaving government jobs are the more senior ones. Taking a DRP offer might mean abandoning a space mission to which they’ve devoted years or even decades. “The ambition is not to climb a corporate ladder. The ambition is to learn more,” she says.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethany_Ehlmann">Bethany Ehlmann</a>, a professor of <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/planetary-science">planetary science</a> at the <a href="https://www.gps.caltech.edu/people/bethany-l-ehlmann">California Institute of Technology</a> who is also president of <a href="https://www.planetary.org/profiles/bethany-ehlmann">The Planetary Society</a>, says she knows some Ph.D. students who, having spent years with NASA careers as their goal, are now considering jobs in other countries.</p>
<p>“U.S. leadership in space depends on industry, NASA, and universities that are educating the workforce, all working together,” Ehlmann says. “It’s a delicate ecosystem, and it’s just really hard when there’s a change of this magnitude. It’s not obvious that people can land in the space ecosystem.”</p>

<p>That system has been changing for years, starting in the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/obama">Obama</a> administration and accelerating after <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/president-trump">President Trump</a> first took office. The plan has been for NASA to let companies like SpaceX take over most of its operational work, such as launching <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/astronauts">astronauts</a> or <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/satellites">satellites</a>, sometimes with the government as a paying customer. That, ideally, would leave NASA free to concentrate on exploration, doing research that pushes back the frontiers of knowledge but doesn’t necessarily turn a profit.</p>
<p>Will that model still be viable if the agency loses too many people with the institutional knowledge to see long-term projects through to completion? Many people in the field, at major aerospace companies and industry groups, declined requests for interviews or did not reply. Certainly, others concede, the agency has been weighed down by bureaucracy, but they say this year’s buyout offers were too broad and too scattershot to make NASA truly more efficient.</p>
<p>“From everything I have seen so far, there’s no thought or succession planning going into this,” says one veteran of several planetary research missions who asked to remain anonymous. “I mean, people leave but there is no plan on how their roles and responsibilities will be picked up by others and replaced. It’s left gaping holes across the agency, reducing the integrity of everything NASA does.”</p>
<h2>NASA Workforce Challenges</h2>
<p>Stand Up for Science circulated a letter of dissent to NASA’s acting administrator, <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/people/sean-duffy/">Sean Duffy</a>, saying that “the culture of fear of retaliation cultivated by this administration” was enough to put space missions and even astronauts’ lives at risk. The letter was titled the <a href="https://www.standupforscience.net/nasa-voyager-declaration?utm_source=press1&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=NASAdec">Voyager Declaration</a>, and 183 current or former NASA employees, including several former astronauts, publicly signed it. The group said another 180 signed but didn’t want their names on record.</p>
<p>Jennifer Mason signed the letter and urged current NASA friends to join. “If you don’t feel comfortable speaking up, if it doesn’t feel like a safe place, then you might not bring up a mission safety issue because you don’t want to be the troublemaker.” But some people, she says, were afraid even to sign anonymously, worried that they could be found out and face retribution.</p>
<p>Mason happens to be a second-generation NASA employee—both her parents worked in Houston—and says her son, now in college, would like to be third-generation. His interest is in the use of AI in <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/control-systems">control systems</a>. But she says she’s urged him to apply to graduate school, partly because an advanced degree would be good, partly too in hope that the current tumult will pass.</p>
<p>“He’s reading the writing on the wall,” says Mason. “And right now it’s a stressful time to be starting an aerospace career.”</p>
