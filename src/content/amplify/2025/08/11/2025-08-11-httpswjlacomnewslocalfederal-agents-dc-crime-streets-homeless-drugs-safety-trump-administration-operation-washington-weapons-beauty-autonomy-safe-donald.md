<p>White House officials said Saturday night saw multiple arrests, including those with weapons, larceny, and an immigrant with a final order of removal. Three semi-automatic pistols were taken, and officials said drugs like fentanyl, crack cocaine, and methamphetamine were also confiscated.</p>
<h2>NATIONAL GUARD IN D.C.</h2>
<p>Murmurs around D.C. about the potential activation of the D.C. National Guard (DC NG) are not new, especially since President Trump returned to office; however, a U.S. official confirmed to ABC News Sunday night of preparation work surrounding a possible activation.</p>
<p>However, no final decision has been made yet.</p>
<figure><div class="rw-embed-wrapper"><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V5mPmSh_gXQ?si=Tw8M0FoARwWUjaO7" type="video/mp4"/></div></figure>
<p>The 2,700-member DC NG can only be controlled by the President, with authority delegated to the Defense Secretary and the Army Secretary.</p>
<p>It's unclear if all of the guardsmen would be deployed, and while it's expected that they will serve in support roles for D.C. Police and other authorities, the extent of their duties has not been determined, per ABC News.</p>
