<p>In “Summer of Our Discontent,” the Atlantic staff writer expands his argument that the behavior of progressives on social media and elsewhere has broken political discourse.</p>
<p>Thomas Chatterton Williams and I disagree on practically everything — race, progressive politics, social media, so-called cancel culture, how much one person should be allowed to quote Camus — and even when I ostensibly agree with him (such as our shared belief in <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/06/french-connection-racist-slurs-censorship/674341/">not censoring objectionable ideas from past art</a>), I find that his ideas are often presented without rigor, and his prose often tedious, to the point that I want to disagree with him anyway.</p>
