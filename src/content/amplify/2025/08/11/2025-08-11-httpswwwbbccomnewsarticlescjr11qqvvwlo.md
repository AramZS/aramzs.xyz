<p>Wikipedia has lost a legal challenge to new Online Safety Act rules which it says could threaten the human rights and safety of its volunteer editors.</p>
<p>The Wikimedia Foundation - the non-profit which supports the online encyclopaedia - wanted a judicial review of regulations which could mean Wikipedia has to verify the identities of its users.</p>
<p>But it said despite the loss, <a href="https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Wikimedia-Foundation-and-another-v-Secretary-of-State-for-Science-Innovation-and-Technology.pdf">the judgement</a> "emphasized the responsibility of Ofcom and the UK government to ensure Wikipedia is protected".</p>
<p>The government told the BBC it welcomed the High Court's judgment, "which will help us continue our work implementing the Online Safety Act to create a safer online world for everyone".</p>
<p>Judicial reviews challenge the lawfulness of the way in which a decision has been made by a public body.</p>
<p>In this case the Wikimedia Foundation and a Wikipedia editor tried to challenge the way in which the government decided to make regulations covering which sites should be classed "Category 1" under the Online Safety Act - the strictest rules sites must follow.</p>
<p>It argued the rules were logically flawed and too broad, meaning a policy intended to impose extra rules on large social media companies would instead apply to Wikipedia.</p>
<p>In particular the foundation is concerned the extra duties required - if Wikipedia was classed as Category 1 - would mean it would have to verify the identity of its contributors, undermining their privacy and safety.</p>
<p>The only way it could avoid being classed as Category 1 would be to cut the number of people in the UK who could access the online encyclopaedia by about three-quarters, or disable key functions on the site.</p>
<p>The government's lawyers argued that ministers had considered whether Wikipedia should be exempt from the regulations but had reasonably rejected the idea.</p>
<h2>'Left the door open'</h2>
<p>In the end, the court rejected Wikimedia's arguments.</p>
<p>But Phil Bradley-Schmieg, Lead Counsel at the Wikimedia Foundation, said the judgment did not give Ofcom and the Secretary of State, in Mr Justice Johnson's words, "a green light to implement a regime that would significantly impede Wikipedia's operations".</p>
<p>And the judgement makes it clear other legal challenges could be possible.</p>
<p>Wikimedia could potentially challenge Ofcom's decision making if the regulator did ultimately decide to classify the site as Category 1.</p>
<p>And if the effect of making Wikipedia Category 1 meant it could not continue to operate, then other legal challenges could follow.</p>
<p>"Wikipedia has been caught in the stricter regulations due to its size and user created content even though it argues (convincingly) that it differs significantly from other user-to-user platforms," said Mona Schroedel, data protection litigation specialist at law firm Freeths.</p>
<p>"The court's decision has left the door open for Wikipedia to be exempt from the stricter rules upon review."</p>
<p>The communications regulator Ofcom, which will enforce the act, told the BBC: "We note the court's judgment and will continue to progress our work in relation to categorised services and the associated extra online safety rules for those companies."</p>
