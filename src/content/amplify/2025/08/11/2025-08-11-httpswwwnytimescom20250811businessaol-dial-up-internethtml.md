<p>AOL announced that it will discontinue its dial-up internet service next month, marking the end of a 34-year offering that is synonymous with the early days of the internet.</p>
<p>The service, and its associated software, will be discontinued on Sept. 30, the company said.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://help.aol.com/articles/dial-up-internet-to-be-discontinued">statement</a> on AOL’s website on Friday said: “AOL routinely evaluates its products and services and has decided to discontinue Dial-up internet.”</p>
<p>AOL, which is owned by Yahoo, did not release information about how many people still use its dial-up service.</p>
<p>The service started in 1991, as home computers were becoming popular. AOL’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dudJjUU9Nhs">dial-up tone</a>, sometimes followed by the “You’ve got mail!” announcement, became the soundtrack for many Americans as they were learning how to navigate the internet.</p>
<p>In 2019, <a href="https://data.census.gov/table/ACSDT1Y2019.B28011?q=ACSDT1Y2019.B28011&amp;hidePreview=true">according to the U.S. census</a>, an estimated 265,000 people in the United States were using only dial-up internet. That was about two percent of the number of people surveyed on their household internet subscriptions.</p>
