<p>Big Tech's foray into nuclear power continues as <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" data-rapid_p="14" data-ylk="slk:Google announced;cpos:1;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/sustainability/google-first-advanced-nuclear-reactor-project-with-kairos-power-and-tennessee-valley-authority/">Google announced</a> the site of its first nuclear reactor today, as part of its <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" data-rapid_p="15" data-ylk="slk:2024 deal;cpos:2;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/google-strikes-a-deal-with-a-nuclear-startup-to-power-its-ai-data-centers-201403750.html">2024 deal</a> with startup Kairos Power. Oak Ridge, Tennessee, will be home to the Hermes 2 plant, which will supply Google with 50 megawatts of power under a long-term purchase agreement with the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA).</p>
<p>The Oak Ridge plant is the first in a 500-megawatt deal that comprises multiple small modular reactors (SMRs) to provide power for Google's data centers in Montgomery County, Tennessee, and Jackson County, Alabama. The Hermes 2 is scheduled to begin operations in 2030.</p>
<p>In a <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" data-rapid_p="16" data-ylk="slk:statement;cpos:3;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/sustainability/google-first-advanced-nuclear-reactor-project-with-kairos-power-and-tennessee-valley-authority/">statement</a>, TVA CEO Don Moul said, "Nuclear is the bedrock of the future of energy security. Google stepping in and helping shoulder the burden of the cost and risk for first-of-a-kind nuclear projects not only helps Google get to those solutions, but it keeps us from having to burden our customers with development of that technology."</p>
<p>Google's <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" data-rapid_p="17" data-ylk="slk:deal with Kairos Power;cpos:4;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/sustainability/google-kairos-power-nuclear-energy-agreement/">deal with Kairos Power</a> is expected to reach its full 500 MW potential by 2035 and was the first-ever corporate deal to buy nuclear power from SMRs. The financial specifics of the deal have not been released.</p>
