title: How to comment on the MTAâ€™s 2025 proposed changes to fares and tolls
---
<p>The MTA will hold three hybrid public hearings on the proposed fare changes:</p>
<p>All public hearings will be held in person at New York City Transit Authority, 130 Livingston Street, 1st Floor, Brooklyn, NY 11201</p>
<ul> <li>Subway:  to Jay St-MetroTech ,  to Court St ,  to Borough Hall ,  to Borough Hall ( accessible Manhattan-bound only)</li> <li>Bus: B25, B26, B38, B41, B45, B52, B57, B61, B62, B65, B67, B103</li> </ul>
<p>There will also be a Zoom option for those who prefer to attend virtually, and the hearings will be livestreamed on the MTA website.</p>
