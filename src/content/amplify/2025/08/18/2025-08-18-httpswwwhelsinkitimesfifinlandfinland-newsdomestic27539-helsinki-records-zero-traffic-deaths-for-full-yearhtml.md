title: Helsinki records zero traffic deaths for full year

<div><blockquote itemprop="description">
<p data-end="659" data-start="462"><strong>Helsinki has completed</strong> an entire year without a single traffic-related fatality, according to city and police officials. The last recorded death occurred in early July 2024 in the Kontula district.</p>
<p data-end="801" data-start="661">Authorities described the milestone as exceptional and credited long-term planning, targeted infrastructure changes, and lower speed limits.</p>
<p data-end="976" data-start="803">“A lot of factors contributed to this, but speed limits are one of the most important,” said <strong data-end="914" data-start="896">Roni Utriainen</strong>, traffic engineer with the city’s Urban Environment Division.</p>
</blockquote>
<section itemprop="articleBody">
<p data-end="1272" data-start="978">More than half of Helsinki’s streets now have speed limits of 30 km/h. Fifty years ago, the majority were limited to 50 km/h. In a move to further reduce risk, the city lowered limits around schools to 30 km/h earlier this year. The new restrictions take effect at the start of the school term.</p>
<p data-end="1559" data-start="1274">Alongside speed control, design has played a key role. Street layouts, intersections, and pedestrian crossings have been redesigned to prioritise safety. Cycling and walking infrastructure has been expanded in recent years, helping to separate vulnerable road users from motor traffic.</p>
<p data-end="1745" data-start="1561">Utriainen also highlighted improvements in traffic enforcement. Cooperation between city officials and police has increased, with more automated speed enforcement and targeted patrols.</p>
<p data-end="1869" data-start="1747">“Public transport in Helsinki is excellent, which reduces car use, and with it, the number of serious accidents,” he said.</p>
<p data-end="1977" data-start="1871">Vehicle safety standards have also advanced, contributing to improved outcomes in the event of collisions.</p>
<p data-end="2227" data-start="1979">The improvement is not limited to fatalities. In the past 12 months, Helsinki recorded 277 accidents resulting in injury. This compares to nearly 1,000 such incidents annually during the late 1980s, when the city often saw up to 30 deaths per year.</p>
<p data-end="2497" data-start="2229">Helsinki’s current traffic safety strategy runs from 2022 to 2026 and includes special measures to protect pedestrians, children, and cyclists. Planning has been supported by better data collection, including digital monitoring of traffic flows and incident reporting.</p>
<p data-end="2678" data-start="2499">Utriainen said the city’s efforts are cumulative and span decades. “The direction has been positive for years,” he said. Helsinki also recorded zero pedestrian fatalities in 2019.</p>
<p data-end="2835" data-start="2680">Electric scooters remain a challenge, though the city has responded by adjusting parking rules, restricting speed in certain areas, and improving signage.</p>
<p data-end="2975" data-start="2837">“They became popular around five years ago, somewhat unexpectedly. But since then, many solutions have been put in place,” Utriainen said.</p>
<p data-end="3114" data-start="2977">He credited all road users, motorists, cyclists, and pedestrians, for contributing to the result through their behaviour and awareness.</p>
<p data-end="3299" data-start="3116">The European Union aims to eliminate all traffic fatalities by 2050, an initiative known as Vision Zero. Utriainen said the target serves as a practical framework for decision-making.</p>
<p data-end="3445" data-start="3301">“For us, it’s more about how the goal guides our everyday actions. We aim to assess all our decisions based on their long-term impact,” he said.</p>
