title: 'Some thoughts on Bsky, age verification and mississippi law'
---
<p>Bluesky is banning access to its app for people from Mississippi following a new drastic age verification law:</p>
<p>Some thoughts:</p>
<ul><li><p data-index="3.0">Bluesky PBC is fully onboard now with viewing clients as access points to the network, and as the point where regulation happens. See also their new ToS, which also makes it clear that this is only for their client</p> </li><li><p data-index="3.1">The messaging from PBC is quite different on this case versus how they handled OSA. Their communication on OSA did not mention at all at their gating system could be bypassed. For Mississippi regulation they explicitly explain it however:"This decision applies only to the Bluesky app, which is one service built on the AT Protocol. Other apps and services may choose to respond differently. We believe this flexibility is one of the strengths of decentralized systemsâ€”different providers can make decisions that align with their values and capabilities, especially during periods of regulatory uncertainty. We remain committed to building a protocol that enables openness and choice."</p> </li><li><p data-index="3.2">Having alternate clients that can access the network only matters when people actually use other clients. So far, PBC has given users very little reason to use other clients, as the main client is very well developed by professionals, making it hard for single volunteer devs to keep up. Unclear if or how that dynamic will change moving forward.</p> </li><li><p data-index="3.4">Mastodon is particularly vulnerable, with a ceo who is not interested in complying with regulation. There is this assumption that the fediverse is so decentralised that regulators will somehow ignore fediverse servers.</p> </li><li><p data-index="3.5">My main concern is for mastodon. ceo eugen rochko is pretty <a href="https://mastodon.social/@Gargron/115074631868019158">explicit that he does not care</a>, but he seems not to realise he is actually vulnerable on two points:</p> </li></ul>
