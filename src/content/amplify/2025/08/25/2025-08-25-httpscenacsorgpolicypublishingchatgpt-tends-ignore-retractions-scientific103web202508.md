<p>The large language model–based chatbot ChatGPT fails to highlight the validity concerns with scientific papers that have been retracted or have been the subject of other editorial notices, according to a new study.</p>
<p>The analysis, published by <i>Learned Publishing</i> on Aug. 4, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/leap.2018">examines whether GPT 4o-mini recognizes the problems</a> with 217 scholarly studies that have been either retracted or highlighted for validity concerns by the <a href="https://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx?">Retraction Watch Database</a>.</p>
<p>The study authors asked GPT 4o-mini, a text-oriented version of the popular software, to evaluate the quality of the 217 papers 30 times each, yielding a total of 6,510 reports. They found that the tool didn’t mention in any of the reports that the papers being analyzed had been retracted or had validity issues.</p>
<p>Instead, in 190 cases, GPT 4o-mini described the papers as being world leading, internationally excellent, or close to that. The 27 papers with the lowest scores were mostly accused of being weak; 5, including 1 about hydroxychloroquine as a COVID-19 treatment, were described as controversial, the study found.</p>
<p>In a follow-up analysis, the authors extracted 61 claims from the studies that had been retracted and asked GPT 4o-mini to check if each claim was true 10 times each. They found that two-thirds of the time, the tool either said yes or gave a positive response.</p>
<p>“We were surprised that, at the time, ChatGPT didn’t deal very well with retractions at all, so it didn’t mention them and reported retracted information as true,” says study coauthor Mike Thelwall, who is a metascience researcher at the University of Sheffield. “One of the main ways in which people get information about science nowadays is through large language models.”</p>
<p>If researchers use ChatGPT to help with a literature review, for instance, they can easily gather retracted articles, Thelwall notes. He recommends that the algorithms behind artificial intelligence chatbots like ChatGPT be tweaked to make them take retractions seriously.</p>
<p>Debora Weber-Wulff, a computer scientist at the HTW Berlin University of Applied Sciences, says in an email that she isn’t surprised by the paper’s conclusions. “People are relying too much on these text-extruding machines, and that will corrupt the scientific record,” she warns.</p>
<p>But Weber-Wulff isn’t convinced by the study’s methods. She points out that the study doesn’t run GPT 4o-mini on a set of nonretracted papers, which would help identify any difference in its approach to the two kinds of papers.</p>
<p>Weber-Wulff says retractions are often not well marked in the literature and not linked to the original studies, making them difficult to identify. “They are only using the title and the abstract for the evaluations and are assuming that there is some sort of method to determine if a paper is retracted that ChatGPT can apply,” she adds.</p>
<p>“The problem is that HUMANS have a very difficult time determining if a paper or a dissertation has been retracted because of the reluctance of journals and universities to properly mark them!”</p>
