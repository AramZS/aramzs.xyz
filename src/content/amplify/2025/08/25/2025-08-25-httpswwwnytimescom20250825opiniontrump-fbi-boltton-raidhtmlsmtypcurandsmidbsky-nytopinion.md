<p><strong>To the Editor:</strong></p>
<p>Re “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/22/us/politics/john-bolton-trump-home-fbi.html">F.B.I. Agents Search Bolton’s Home</a>” (front page, Aug. 23) and “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/22/opinion/trump-john-bolton-raid.html">Trump’s Revenge Campaign, Live on TV</a>” (editorial, Aug. 23):</p>
<p>The chilling front-page photo of F.B.I. agents about to invade John R. Bolton’s house should fill every American, regardless of political or ideological stance, with fear.</p>
<p>This isn’t about Mr. Bolton — a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, a former national security adviser, a Republican and a Fox News commentator — leaking classified information to the press or mishandling government documents, as President Trump and his morally supple sycophants are alleging.</p>
<p>Mr. Bolton has not held government office in six years, while the raid on his residence came within 24 hours after he appeared on CNN criticizing Mr. Trump’s Alaska summit with President Vladimir of Russia, saying, “Trump didn’t lose, but Putin clearly won.”</p>
<p>Mr. Trump’s version of justice is a threat to everyone, including members of his own party who somehow delude themselves into thinking they have safe refuge. If they dare utter a syllable of criticism, they don’t.</p>

<p>President Trump is not using the justice system to uphold the law, but to punish his critics and intimidate potential dissenters.</p>
<p>The F.B.I. raids and investigations aimed at John Bolton, the Attorney General of New York Letitia James, Senator Adam Schiff, Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook and even former President Barack Obama are about retribution, not justice. Even if no charges emerge, the process itself is destructive: reputations are tarnished, resources drained, and a chilling message is sent that opposition to the president carries personal risk.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump insists he is only doing to others what was once done to him. That is false. His indictments followed evidence of wrongdoing; his opponents are facing politically engineered accusations with little substance.</p>
<p>When law enforcement becomes a political weapon for taking revenge on perceived adversaries, the rule of law ceases to be law at all — it becomes just another tool of tyranny.</p>

<p><strong>To the Editor:</strong></p>
<p>President Trump’s F.B.I. director Kash Patel posted on social media during the raid of John Bolton’s home that “NO ONE is above the law.”</p>
<p>If Mr. Trump really believed nobody was above the law, he would have punished the cabinet officials who invited a reporter into their Signal chat and shared military secrets on that chat. And Mr. Trump himself would have taken responsibility for mishandling sensitive documents by leaving them in a Mar-a-Lago bathroom.</p>
<p>The Trump administration runs on the principle that he and his friends are above the law, while the law is a tool to punish his enemies. America deserves better.</p>

<p><strong>To the Editor:</strong></p>
<p>Re “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/12/opinion/trump-manhattan-project.html">The White House Is Undoing 80 Years of American Greatness</a>,” by Garrett M. Graff (Opinion guest essay, Aug. 17):</p>
<p>Mr. Graff’s guest essay eloquently and alarmingly underscores the Trump administration’s atavistic aversion to government’s critical role in supporting intellectual and scientific inquiry.</p>
<p>Our nation possesses vast resources available to address the most consequential issues confronting humankind, including disease prevention, climate change and the development of cost-effective, viable alternative energy sources. But the administration’s anti-intellectual posture is squandering them, undermining the realization of untold opportunities to optimize the health, prosperity and safety of the American people.</p>

<p><strong>To the Editor:</strong></p>
<p>I wholeheartedly agree with Mr. Graff’s assessment of the gutting of scientific and biomedical research. But I am surprised at his comment that “it is all the more puzzling that the attack on universities and government-supported research has come from the Trump administration,” which led the effort to develop a Covid vaccine.</p>
<p>For this foreign-born scientist, it is not puzzling at all. President Trump wants to destroy universities and their scientific enterprise for a very simple reason: We generate knowledge, and knowledge is power. And it is this power that threatens Mr. Trump and his agenda.</p>
<p>Universities have always stood in the way of authoritarians, and Mr. Trump is keenly aware of this. He is simply taking a page out of the playbook of current authoritarians such as Viktor Orban of Hungary, Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, President Vladimir Putin of Russia and others.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump’s propaganda does not pass muster with many academics who know exactly what he is doing — consolidating power and actively chipping away at democracy.</p>
