<p>DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Four journalists were among at least eight people killed on Monday in a strike on a hospital in southern Gaza, including a freelancer who worked for the Associated Press.</p>
<p>Mariam Dagga, 33 freelanced for the AP since the Gaza war began, as well as other news outlets.</p>
<p>Dagga <a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/palestinians-gaza-children-starvation-israel-netanyahu-0549e843c24fe7f20f1e7ce085502450">reported on Nasser Hospital doctors</a> struggling to save children with no prior health issues who were wasting away from starvation.</p>
<p>Al Jazeera confirmed that its journalist Mohammed Salam was among those who were killed in the Nasser hospital strike. Reuters reported that its contractor cameraman Hussam al-Masri was also killed in the strike. Photographer Hatem Khaled, who was also a Reuters contractor, was wounded, the news agency reported.</p>
<p>The Israel-Hamas has been one of the bloodiest conflicts for media workers, with a total of 192 journalists killed in Gaza in the 22-month conflict, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. Comparatively, 18 journalists have been killed so far in the Russia-Ukraine war, according to the CPJ.</p>
<p>The Israeli Prime Minister’s Office and Israeli military refused to comment on the incident.</p>
