I don't see that complying with laws that force users to identify themselves is an option, even if I knew technically how to do it. The only way I see of keeping the site going that <i>might</i> work is to delete all the old content, rename the site, and begin again as a Tor hidden service. Obviously, that would be devastating for all of us as users, and the number of people who are using the site would likely drop by 80%, which would very likely mean the end of the site. That approach would also make it impossible to block web-scraping robots and protect the site from spammers. In other words, it would very likely just kill the site. I don't know of any alternative network to the Web that would allow Blue Dwarf to continue in its present form. The fate I outlined for Tor would, I think, occur with any of them.<br/><br/>Another option I have considered is keeping Blue Dwarf basically as it is but moving it to a rented server in another country, maybe Iceland. I am not sure of the operations security required to run it in such a way that the US government could not eventually find me and force me to shut it down. Also, this seems to be a world-wide push by some group of people we don't know to end online free speech everywhere in the world at once, so I doubt any country would remain a haven for online free speech for long.<br/><br/>Even if I had the technical ability to take Bluesky's approach of blocking any US state that makes anonymity impossible for its residents, I don't see that approach working for long. Since the goal of governments is ultimately to prevent free speech, they will very likely just keep passing more and more restrictive laws until 99.9% of people cannot visit any social media site anonymously. And governments don't need to care about 0.1% of people, because they aren't enough to pressure them into doing anything.<br/><br/>So, I am out of ideas. Does anyone else have any? <br/><br/> <p>post# 6051 </p> </td> </tr> </tbody></table>
