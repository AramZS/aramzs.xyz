<p>In January 2024, <a data-component="link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/umg:na">Universal Music Group</a> Chief Executive Officer Lucian Grainge declared the <a data-component="link" href="https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/sir-lucian-grainge-after-artist-centric-royalties-umgs-next-focus-is-superfan-experiences-and-products/">era of the superfan</a>. Grainge is the head of the biggest music company in the world, and his annual missives to start the year double as an effort to set an agenda for the industry.</p>
