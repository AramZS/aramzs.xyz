  Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at CUNY Launches Free “Journalism
  for All” High School Curriculum
---
<p>NEW YORK, NY, August 25, 2025 – The Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at CUNY today announced the launch of the Journalism for All curriculum — a free, year-long high school journalism curriculum designed to expand access to media education at a time of growing misinformation and mistrust.</p>
<p>The curriculum—set to be taught in 30 New York City public high schools beginning next week —will give students the tools to think critically, evaluate information, and tell the stories that matter to their communities. Newmark’s <a href="https://www.journalism.cuny.edu/j-plus/">J+ program</a> trained <a href="https://www.journalism.cuny.edu/2025/01/30-nyc-high-school-teachers-start-journalism-training-with-the-journalism-for-all-program/">30 New York City public high school teachers</a> to teach the curriculum, making them pioneering members of a citywide community of practice.</p>
<p>“We’re confident this curriculum will mark a major step toward ensuring access to journalism opportunities in high schools across the city,” said Graciela Mochkofsky, dean of the Craig Newmark J-School. “This effort speaks to key aspects of our mission: cultivating future generations of journalists from every community.”</p>
<p>High school journalism faces a critical decline: Just 27% of New York City public high schools have a student news publication, down from 50% a decade ago. Among the 100 schools with the highest poverty rates, only seven have student publications, according to <a href="https://blogs.baruch.cuny.edu/hsjournalism/haves-and-have-nots/">Baruch College research</a>. This decline threatens the pipeline of future journalists—and the public’s ability to stay informed.</p>
<p>To address this crisis, the curriculum was developed by editor and journalism educator Katina Paron as part of Journalism for All—a $3 million public-private effort led by the <a href="https://www.youthjournalismnyc.org/">Youth Journalism Coalition</a> to build sustainable journalism programs in underserved public high schools. The initiative tackles a key barrier identified by educators: the lack of a high-quality, ready-to-use journalism curriculum. Paron trained the 30 educators to teach the curriculum during a series of sessions that stretched from January to August.</p>

<p>More than 2,250 students across 30 New York City public high schools will participate in the program’s first three years, with opportunities to publish their work, join paid summer internships at local news outlets, and develop essential skills in critical thinking, ethical decision-making, and storytelling. Many participating schools serve communities where more than 80% of students face economic hardship.</p>
<p>“Launching a journalism program can feel overwhelming, but this curriculum makes it doable and adaptable to our school,” said Noreen Fitzgerald-Makar, Journalism Adviser at Thomas A. Edison CTE High School in Jamaica, NY. “Journalism can’t be done passively. This program gives kids the tools and confidence to tell the stories that matter to them.”</p>
<p>The curriculum, designed for schools in New York and beyond, is built to help students:</p>
<ul> <li>Evaluate news and information for reliability and bias</li> <li>Understand the role of a free press in a democracy</li> <li>Represent community voices accurately and ethically</li> <li>Produce original reporting that highlights issues often overlooked</li> </ul>
<p>The Journalism for All curriculum and related teacher training are funded by the Charles H. Revson Foundation.</p>
