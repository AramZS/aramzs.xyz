title: Taking another look at social networks and RSS
---
<p>Today, Dave Winer <a href="http://scripting.com/2025/08/18.html#a132442">wrote </a>“What if you made a social network out of RSS?”. He then basically described a feed reader interface, and used examples from <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/08/18/timelinesnapshot.png">Bluesky </a>and <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/08/18/timelinetwitter.png">Twitter</a>. However, I think that an important point of what people think of as “social networks” was overlooked or omitted. If you look at the Bluesky/Twitter examples, you can see that someone posts, and then replies are shown. I do not think that the “timeline viewer” that Dave Winer is “<a href="http://scripting.com/2025/08/17.html#a143233">teasing</a>” in recent posts is going to show or allow replies. The development of <a href="https://wordland.social/">WordLand </a>and its <a href="https://github.com/scotthansonde/wordlandBaseline">Baseline </a>theme does not support comments or replies.</p>
<p>During the development of <a href="https://github.com/andysylvester/MyStatusTool">MyStatusTool</a>, my collaborator Colin Walker <a href="https://github.com/colin-walker/mst-namespace">proposed a namespace</a> to allow replies via RSS. Perhaps this could be a stepping stone to supporting replies, and therefore conversations, via RSS. Just having a feed reader isn’t having a conversation, and isn’t particularly social. For other tools in this space, see my site <a href="https://feednetwork.social/">The Feed Network</a>.</p>
