<p>Two big assumptions underlie President Donald Trump’s attack on diversity, equity and inclusion policies. The first is that discrimination against people of color is <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/01/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-protects-civil-rights-and-merit-based-opportunity-by-ending-illegal-dei">a thing of the past</a>. The second is that DEI policies and practices discriminate against white people – <a href="https://theweek.com/politics/trump-second-term-anti-white-racism-civil-rights-stephen-miller">especially white men</a> – in what’s sometimes called “reverse discrimination.”</p>
<p>I’m <a href="https://fredlpincus.com/">a sociologist</a> who’s spent decades <a href="https://www.rienner.com/title/Reverse_Discrimination_Dismantling_the_Myth">studying race and inequality</a>, and when I read the documents and statements coming out of the Trump White House, these assumptions jump out at me again and again – usually implicitly, but always there.</p>
<p>The problem is that the evidence doesn’t back these assumptions up.</p>
<p>For one thing, if discrimination against white Americans were widespread, you might expect large numbers to report being treated unfairly. But polling data shows otherwise. A <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2025/05/20/views-of-how-much-discrimination-racial-and-ethnic-groups-in-the-u-s-face">2025 Pew survey</a> found that 70% of white Americans think Black people face “some” or “a lot” of discrimination in general, and roughly two-thirds say the same of Asian and Hispanic people. Meanwhile, only 45% of white Americans believe that white people in general experience that degree of discrimination.</p>
<p>In other words, white Americans believe that people of color, as a group, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2025/05/20/views-of-how-much-discrimination-racial-and-ethnic-groups-in-the-u-s-face/">face more discrimination than white people do</a>. People of color agree – and so do Americans overall.</p>
<p>In a second national study, using data collected in 2023, Americans were asked if they had <a href="https://www.kff.org/racial-equity-and-health-policy/poll-finding/survey-on-racism-discrimination-and-health/">personally experienced discrimination</a> within the past year. Thirty-eight percent of white people said they had, compared to 54% of Black Americans, 50% of Latinos and 42% of Asian Americans. In other words, white Americans are much less likely to say that they’ve been discriminated against than people of color.</p>
<h2>The ‘hard’ numbers show persistent privilege</h2>
<p>These statistics are sometimes called “soft” data because they reflect people’s perceptions rather than verified incidents. To broaden the picture, it’s worth looking at “hard” data on measures like income, education and employment outcomes. These indicators also suggest that white Americans as a group are advantaged relative to people of color.</p>
<p>For example, federal agencies have documented racial disparities in income for decades, with white Americans, as a group, <a href="https://www.census.gov/search-results.html?searchType=web&amp;cssp=SERP&amp;q=annual%20income%20by%20Race%20and%20Ethnicity">generally outearning Black and Latino Americans</a>. This is true even when you <a href="https://edsource.org/updates/what-survey-shows-about-americans-with-bachelors-degrees">control for education</a>. When the Census Bureau looked at median annual earnings for Americans between 25 and 64 with at least a bachelor’s degree, it found that Black Americans received only 81% of what comparably educated white Americans earned, while Latinos earned only 80%. Asian Americans, on the other hand, earned 119% of what white people earned.</p>
<p>These gaps persist even when you hold college major constant. In the highest-paying major, electrical engineering, Black Americans earned only 71% of what white people did, while Latinos earned just 73%. Asian Americans, in contrast, earned 104% of what white people earned. In the lowest-paid major, family and consumer sciences, African Americans earned 97% of what white people did, and Latinos earned 94%. Asian Americans earned 117% of what white people earned. The same general pattern of white income advantage existed in all majors with two exceptions: Black people earned more in elementary education and nursing.</p>
<p>Remember, this is comparing individuals with a bachelor’s degree or higher to people with the same college major. Again, white Americans are still advantaged in most career paths over Black Americans and Latinos.</p>
<h2>Disparities persist in the job market</h2>
<p>Unemployment data show similar patterns. The <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/archives/empsit_08012025.pdf">July 2025</a> figures for workers at all education levels show that Black people were 1.9 times more likely to be unemployed than white Americans. Latinos were 1.4 times more likely to be unemployed, and Asian Americans, 1.1 times.</p>
<p>This same white advantage still occurs when looking only at workers who have earned a bachelor’s degree or more. Black Americans who have earned bachelor’s degrees or higher were <a href="https://cew.georgetown.edu/cew-reports/jobtracker/#unemployment-tracking">1.3 times more likely to be unemployed</a> than similarly educated white Americans as of 2021, the last year for which data is available. Latinos with college degrees were 1.4 times more likely to be unemployed than similar white Americans. The white advantage was even higher for those with only a high school degree or less. Unfortunately, data for Asian Americans weren’t available.</p>
<p>In another study, researchers sent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/08/upshot/employment-discrimination-fake-resumes.html">80,000 fake resumes</a> in response to 10,000 job listings posted by 97 of the largest employers in the country. The credentials on the resumes were essentially the same, but the names signaled race: Some had Black-sounding names, like Lakisha or Leroy, while others had more “white-sounding” names like Todd or Allison. This method is known as an “audit study.”</p>
<p>This research, which was conducted between 2019 and 2021, found that employers were 9.5% more likely to contact the Todds and Allisons than the Lakishas and Leroys within 30 days of receiving a resume. Of the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1706255114">28 audit studies that have been conducted since 1989</a>, each one showed that applicants with Black- or Latino-sounding names were less likely to be contacted that those with white-sounding or racially neutral names.</p>
<p>Finally, a 2025 study <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/admissions/traditional-age/2025/07/09/college-counselors-write-shorter-letters-students-color">analyzed 600,000 letters of recommendation</a> for college-bound students who used the Common App form during the 2018-19 and 2019-20 academic years. Only students who applied to at least one selective college were included. The study found that letters for Black and Latino students were shorter and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s11162-025-09847-5">said less about their intellectual promise</a>.</p>
<p>Similarly, letters in support of first-generation students – that is, whose parents hadn’t graduated from a four-year college, and who are disproportionately likely to be Black and Latino – had fewer sentences dedicated to their scientific, athletic and artistic abilities, or their overall academic potential.</p>
<p>These and other studies don’t provide evidence of massive anti-white discrimination. Although scattered cases of white people being discriminated against undoubtedly exist, the data suggest that white people are still advantaged relative to non-Asian people of color. White Americans may be less advantaged than they were, but they’re still advantaged.</p>
<p>While it’s true that many working-class white Americans are having a tough time in the current economy, it’s not because of their race. It’s <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/what-policymakers-need-to-know-about-todays-working-class">because of their class</a>. It’s because of automation and overseas outsourcing taking away good jobs. It’s because of <a href="https://theconversation.com/us-health-care-is-rife-with-high-costs-and-deep-inequities-and-thats-no-accident-a-public-health-historian-explains-how-the-system-was-shaped-to-serve-profit-and-politicians-256393">high health care costs</a> and <a href="https://theconversation.com/us-safety-net-helps-protect-children-from-abuse-and-neglect-and-some-of-those-programs-are-threatened-by-proposed-budget-cuts-255763">cuts in the safety nets</a>.</p>
<p>In other words, while many working-class white people are struggling now, there’s little evidence race is the problem.</p>
