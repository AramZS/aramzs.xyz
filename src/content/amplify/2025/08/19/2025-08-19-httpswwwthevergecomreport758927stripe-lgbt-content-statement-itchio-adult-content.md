<p>Stripe, a financial services company that acts as a payment processor for millions of businesses including itch.io, has issued an apology following reports that members of its support team told callers the business does not support the sale of LGBTQ content.</p>
<p>“We apologize: the information given by our support team was totally wrong,” said Stripe spokesperson Casey Becker in an email to<em> The Verge</em>. “Stripe has no prohibitions on the sale of LGBTQ+ content or goods.”</p>
<p>Angry customers <a href="https://aftermath.site/steam-itch-porn-censorship-collective-shout-visa-mastercard-paypal">have been calling payment processors</a> on behalf of the creators who have had <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/712890/itch-removes-adult-nsfw-games-steam-payment-providers">their adult content deindexed</a> — or removed from search queries — by itch.io. Stripe’s terms and conditions does <a href="https://support.stripe.com/questions/prohibited-and-restricted-businesses-list-faqs">prohibit the sale of any kind of adult content</a>, but on social media, some callers have reported Stripe customer support reps have said “No,” when directly asked if Stripe permits the sale of legal, non-adult, LGBT content.</p>
<p>“Twice today, when pressured, Stripe operators have said, plainly, that I cannot use Stripe for the purchase of LGBTQ content,” <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dieselbrain.bsky.social/post/3lwa2ig3o4s2g">wrote Dieselbrain</a>, a monsterkink artist on Bluesky. “Not just adult content, but explicitly LGBTQ.”</p>
<p>Others <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/madycast.com/post/3lwciacse6s2h">have shared recordings</a> of calls where Stripe representatives say that it prohibits LGBTQ content. <em>The Verge </em>has reviewed one recording where a caller asks for clarification on whether Stripe allows LGBTQ content. The Stripe representative then says, “As far as we know, no. We restricted all that content three weeks ago.”</p>
<p>According to Becker, this is a mistake. “We’re looking into this and making sure future inquiries are answered correctly,” Becker said.</p>
