<p>A culmination of five years of on-the-ground and behind-the-scenes research, <em>State Fairs: Growing American Craft</em> is the first exhibition dedicated to artists’ contributions to the great U.S. tradition of state fairs with more than 240 artworks on view, dating from the mid-nineteenth century to the present.</p>
<p>Each gallery in this exhibition considers personal stories of craft found in different areas of the fairgrounds, from the art exhibits and heritage villages to the parades, dairy barns, and rodeos. Ribbon-winning artworks and engaging craft demonstrations illuminate the lives of the artists—their families, memories, honors, and struggles. It offers a perspective on the social power of fairgrounds across the United States and dispels stereotypes about rural communities. Artists and 4-H clubs from 43 states and tribal nations are represented, with all 50 states represented in a photo gallery.</p>
<p>Visitors will enjoy show-stopping spectacles like the iconic size 96 boots of Big Tex® from the State Fair of Texas®, a life-size butter cow created on-site by the Iowa State Fair’s official butter sculptor Sarah Pratt, and a display featuring a pyramid of 700 glass jars of preserved fruits and vegetables by canning superstar Rod Zeitler. Justin Favela’s new site-specific installation <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="33791c0a-6285-40ff-8d5d-00992dae9d4e" href="https://americanart.si.edu/node/68256"><em>Capilla de Maiz (Maize Chapel)</em></a> debuts in the Rubenstein Grand Salon to coincide with the opening of <em>State Fairs</em>.</p>
<p>A beautifully illustrated catalogue, published in association with Smithsonian Books, will be available for purchase in the museum’s store and online.</p>
<p><em>State Fairs: Growing American Craft</em> is curated by Mary Savig, the Fleur and Charles Bresler Curator-in-Charge for the Renwick Gallery, with contributing curators Amber-Dawn Bear Robe, Elana Hain, Jon Kay, and Sara Morris with curatorial support from Elizabeth Routhier.</p>
