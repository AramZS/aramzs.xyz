<p>Every day we make choices about how we spend our money. Most people want to make buying decisions that have a positive impact on their community and the planet. Likewise, many businesses want to showcase how their sourcing and employment principles have this same positive impact.</p>

<h2 data-kb-block="kb-adv-heading10261_4ea234-8e">Economic Nutrition is a new way to encourage businesses and consumers to invest in the future of local economies.</h2>
<p>Information about “where the money goes” is rarely available at the point of purchase. Due to the complexity of modern supply networks and ownership structures, it can be difficult to define your dollar’s impact along the input chain.</p>
<p>Nutrition labels for food were introduced in 1973. Burkey Belser’s accessible, transparent design revolutionized the way people eat and understand their agency as consumers of food products. The Economic Nutrition Certification Mark is modeled after food nutrition labels as an illustrative tool to show the financial information behind any product or service, equipping consumers with the knowledge they need to understand how their purchase impacts the economic health of communities.</p>
<p>The Certification Mark shows any consumer what their money pays for by displaying the percentage of every dollar spent by an organization to produce the certified product. Expenses like labour, materials, or marketing – even the geographic distribution of every dollar spent, is made visible by the Economic Nutrition Certification Mark.</p>
<p>Enabling businesses with tools to show financial information beyond the price provides customers with the knowledge they need to make informed decisions. Economic Nutrition empowers consumers to choose products and businesses that support local economies so that every purchase becomes a meaningful investment.</p>

<p>The information along the top of the label includes the business name and type of business structure, giving a frame of reference for the information being shared. The labels are derived from a business’s total operations costs for a fiscal year.</p>
<p>This section identifies where the money used to source inputs lands geographically across four categories: local, regional, national, and international. “Local” represents a Municipal area (city, town, or community) with “Regional” representing the respective Province of source (for Canadian users). “National” represents the respective Country and all costs beyond this level are grouped as “International.”</p>
<p>This section breaks down the percentage of the organization’s costs by operating category. The category descriptions (such as salaries &amp; wages, property costs, ingredients, etc.) are designed to be easily understood by a wide range of readers referencing multiple industries, products, and services for consistency when referencing.</p>

<p>Economic Nutrition emerged on Fogo Island as a transparency tool for Shorefast’s community enterprises. As an initiative of the <a href="https://shorefast.org/work/the-shorefast-institute/">Shorefast Institute for Place-Based Economies</a>, Economic Nutrition is one of many programs re-shaping the economy around place.</p>

<p>Economic Nutrition<sup>CM</sup> is a concept that has been developed by Shorefast and is modeled after the practice of food nutrition labeling.</p>
<p>Nutrition is defined as the branch of science that deals with nutrients, particularly its impact on humans. To make the detailed science of food nutrition relatable when people were making food purchases, simple labels were developed to standardize the communication process. Food nutrition labels identify the ingredients in our food and how the related nutrients impact our individual health when consumed, making us better informed about our food choices.</p>
<p>Shorefast’s Economic Nutrition<sup>CM</sup> follows the same logic, with the intent of making the economy more relatable so individuals are better informed about the economic impact they can make when purchasing products and services. To simplify the detailed accounting and complex money flows that together represent the economic impact, Shorefast developed clear and simple labels to standardize the communication process.</p>
<p>Economic Nutrition<sup>CM</sup> labels clearly demonstrate where the money goes to source inputs for products and services with the goal of making consumers better informed about their purchasing decisions and the impact their purchase has on the health of their local community.</p>
