title: Journalism's future lies in relationships

You have to build a direct relationship with your core readers, said GQ's editorial director in an interview recently. If you ask me, that is the last lifeline journalism has if we were to survive tech disruption 2.0.
 </p>
<h3>
Because, let's say it out loud...
 </h3>
<p>
Journalism was never about the making of articles. Journalism's core function "<a data-test-app-aware-link="" href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/death-article-again-david-cohn-0ytec?trackingId=bT9SAxx4hkbktjYfNhaqWg%3D%3D&amp;lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base%3BEOElAgqFTVW1ihbYhnojuw%3D%3D" tabindex="0" target="_self">is the process of collecting, filtering, and distributing information</a><span> </span>with layers of rigor: accuracy, ethics, verification, and service to the public." Much needed reminder, thank you<span> </span><a data-test-app-aware-link="" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidjcohn?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_miniProfile%3AACoAAABtk0oBEn_NeLRZx0oMqrvAOEmhKz9ofTk" tabindex="0" target="_self"><strong>David Cohn</strong></a>.<span> </span>
</p>
<p>
As AI becomes capable of generating endless (and gradually even verified) content;<span> </span><a data-test-app-aware-link="" href="https://knightlab.northwestern.edu/2025/07/21/jr3-workshop-recap/index.html" tabindex="0" target="_self">will the world still need journalism?</a><span> </span>Yes, if we embrace that journalism's real value has shifted from production to process. From what we create to how we gather, verify, and contextualize information. And there's something even more fundamental at stake: the relationships that make this process trustworthy and meaningful.
 </p>
<blockquote>
The world doesn't need journalism. The world needs relationships with journalists.
 </blockquote>
<h3>
The relationship deficit in media
 </h3>
<p>
We got too busy keeping up with algorithms that optimize for engagement and AI tools that enable content creation at scale. So much so, we unconsciously moved away from the very thing that defined our information gathering process: genuine human connection with the communities we reported for and about.
 </p>
<p>
We became extraordinarily good at asking questions but not so good at demonstrating we've actually heard the answers. We mastered the art of broadcasting but forgot how to have intimate conversations. We built sophisticated content management systems while neglecting relationship management entirely.
 </p>
<p>
<a data-test-app-aware-link="" href="https://www.vivekmurthy.com/partingprescription" tabindex="0" target="_self">US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy's parting prescription</a><span> </span>for America's loneliness epidemic provides an unexpected roadmap for journalism's transformation. Community is where we know each other, help each other, and find purpose in contributing to each other's lives. Watching community serve as a powerful source of life satisfaction and life expectancy in India; I couldn't agree more.
 </p>
<p>
Community requires an explicit commitment to be a part of each other's lives and to make those lives better. It is built on three pillars, he stated:<span> </span><strong>relationships, service, and purpose</strong>. Now journalism had purpose and service (well atleast the intent) baked in right from the beginning. But we failed at<span> </span><strong>relationships (</strong>and how). We chose to sit on a mighty horse of righteousness and othered ourselves from the very communities we signed up to serve.
 </p>
<blockquote>
The relationship pillar, this quintessential human advantage is our strongest and only armour in the AI-generated information abundance era with dwindling trust.
 </blockquote>
<p>
People need less information and more relationships with humans who help them make sense of that information. They need journalists who belong to their communities, not just report on them. Our highest value now increasingly lies in how we relate, not what we produce.<span> </span>
</p>
<h3>
Journalism as social infrastructure
 </h3>
<p>
But what does that really look like? Think journalism goes from content delivery to community facilitation. Journalism becomes the space where communities process complex challenges together, maintain democratic discourse, and find shared understanding. Yes, this would mean we rethink everything.<span> </span>
</p>
<p>
Calling for a shift from viewing our audience as metrics to treating them as relationships to nurture....
 </p>
<p>
<strong>from wider reach to deeper impact:<span> </span></strong>Stop counting pageviews. Start tracking whether people actually feel connected to your work. Are readers commenting thoughtfully? Are they sharing your stories in their own communities? Are they coming back not just for information, but because they feel part of something larger?
 </p>
<p>
<strong>from social media management to relationship management:<span> </span></strong>Newsrooms are finally hiring "community managers," but most still think this means someone who managed social media and responds to comments. That's missing the point entirely. A real community manager is like a customer relationship manager at a bank.
 </p>
<p>
<strong>from broadcast journalism to dialogue journalism:<span> </span></strong>Real journalism begins after you hit publish. An investigation should spark discussions in coffee shops and community centers. A feature story should give people language to talk about complex issues with their neighbors. Reporting should help diverse community members understand each other better, not just consume information in isolation.
 </p>
<blockquote>
In a world spewing AI generated content managed by algorithms at scale, journalism has an opportunity to optimize for something entirely different: CARE.
 </blockquote>
<p>
In practice that would look like
 </p>
<p>
</p><ul><li><strong>Knowing our community</strong><span> </span>like local shop owners know their customers, their concerns, celebrations, and challenges</li><li><strong>Showing up consistently</strong><span> </span>during crises as both information source and emotional anchor</li><li><strong>Creating gathering spaces</strong><span> </span>where diverse voices engage constructively around shared concerns</li><li><strong>Facilitate difficult conversations</strong><span> </span>that help communities work through disagreement</li><li><strong>Celebrate collective wins</strong><span> </span>and acknowledge shared struggles</li></ul>
<p>
This means training journalists in emotional intelligence to go beyond content creation and become effective community facilitators. Journalists need to develop deep listening skills that go beyond extracting quotes to genuinely understanding what communities are wrestling with.<span> </span>
</p>
<p>
We need cultural competency that serves authentically rather than extractively, study conflict resolution abilities that help communities process disagreement constructively. Most importantly, we need long-term relationship thinking that prioritizes building trust over years, not driving traffic over hours.<span> </span>
</p>
<h3>
The economics of connection
 </h3>
<p>
<a data-test-app-aware-link="" href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7333075541958230018?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_feedUpdate%3A%28V2%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7333075541958230018%29&amp;lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base%3Bw7bkh1qGSIqJvefwEh8lYw%3D%3D" tabindex="0" target="_self">There is a strong business case too.</a><span> </span>Independent journalists and media creators are already proving this relationship-first model works economically. They're building direct connections with audiences, creating intimate communities, and driving real change; through deep engagement.
 </p>
<p>
Newsletter creators know their subscribers personally. Podcasters build relationships that feel authentically reciprocal. Local journalists become trusted community members. These creators understand what traditional newsrooms have forgotten: in an AI-saturated world, power lies not in the content itself, but in the relationship behind it.
 </p>
<p>
<strong>The choice is ours</strong>
</p>
<p>
We can either try to compete with machines on their terms, or double down on what makes us irreplaceably human. My money is on intimacy and connection, on our ability to see and to be seen.<span> </span>
</p>
<p>
"We are at our best not when we fear but when we love, not when we turn away but when we turn toward one another," wrote Murthy. For journalism, turning toward one anotherâ€”toward our communities, our readers, our neighbors is the only way we should aspire to be remembered.<span> </span>
