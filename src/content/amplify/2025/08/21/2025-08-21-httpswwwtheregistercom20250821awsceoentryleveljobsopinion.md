title: AWS CEO says AI replacing junior staff is 'dumbest idea'
---
<div><div>
<p>Amazon Web Services CEO Matt Garman has suggested firing junior workers because AI can do their jobs is "the dumbest thing I've ever heard."</p>
<p>Garman made that remark in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfocTxMzOP4" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">conversation</a> with AI investor Matthew Berman, during which he talked up AWS’s <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/18/aws_updated_kiro_pricing/" target="_blank">Kiro AI-assisted coding tool</a> and said he's encountered business leaders who think AI tools "can replace all of our junior people in our company."</p>
<p>That notion led to the “dumbest thing I've ever heard” quote, followed by a justification that junior staff are “probably the least expensive employees you have” and also the most engaged with AI tools.</p>
<p>“How's that going to work when ten years in the future you have no one that has learned anything,” he asked. “My view is you absolutely want to keep hiring kids out of college and teaching them the right ways to go build software and decompose problems and think about it, just as much as you ever have.”</p>
<p>Naturally he thinks AI – and Kiro, natch – can help with that education.</p>
<p>Garman is also not keen on another idea about AI – measuring its value by what percentage of code it contributes at an organization.</p>
<p>“It’s a silly metric,” he said, because while organizations can use AI to write “infinitely more lines of code” it could be bad code.</p>
<p>“Often times fewer lines of code is way better than more lines of code,” he observed. “So I'm never really sure why that's the exciting metric that people like to brag about.”</p>
<p>That said, he’s seen data that suggests over 80 percent of AWS’s developers use AI in some way.</p>
<p>“Sometimes it's writing unit tests, sometimes it's helping write documentation, sometimes it's writing code, sometimes it's kind of an agentic workflow” in which developers collaborate with AI agents.</p>
<p>Garman said usage of AI tools by AWS developers increases every week.</p>
<p>The CEO also offered some career advice for the AI age, suggesting that kids these days need to learn how to learn – and not just learn specific skills.</p>
<p>“I think the skills that should be emphasized are how do you think for yourself? How do you develop critical reasoning for solving problems? How do you develop creativity? How do you develop a learning mindset that you're going to go learn to do the next thing?”</p>
<p>Garman thinks that approach is necessary because technological development is now so rapid it’s no longer sensible to expect that studying narrow skills can sustain a career for 30 years. He wants educators to instead teach “how do you think and how do you decompose problems”, and thinks kids who acquire those skills will thrive. ®</p>
