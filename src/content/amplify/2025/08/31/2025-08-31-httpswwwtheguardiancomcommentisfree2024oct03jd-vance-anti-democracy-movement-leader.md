<h2 data-gu-name="standfirst">Rightwing tech lords are betting that Vance will be the Republican presidential pick in 2028. They’re probably right</h2>
<p>JD Vance, the Republican candidate for vice-president, will almost certainly be the Republican presidential candidate in 2028, regardless of whether <a data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> wins in November.</p>
<p>But who is <a data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jd-vance">JD Vance</a>, really? An opportunist chameleon who once viewed Donald Trump as “Hitler” and is now his pit bull?</p>
<p>Or does Vance have an agenda over and above mere political ambition?</p>
<p>In one of the most important exchanges of Tuesday’s vice-presidential debate, Vance refused to say that the former president lost the 2020 election, and he downplayed the violent events of January 6. Vance also declined to rule out challenging the outcome of the upcoming election even if votes were certified by every state leader as legitimate.</p>
<p>Trump picked Vance as his running mate because Vance publicly stated he’d do what Mike Pence refused to do – overturn democracy and place the US under Maga control.</p>
<p>In response to a question ABC’s George Stephanopoulos asked Vance last February – “Had you been vice-president on January 6th, would you have certified the election results?” – Vance <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/week-transcript-2-4-24-white-house-national/story?id=106926540">said</a>: “If I had been vice-president, I would have told the states, like Pennsylvania, Georgia, and so many others, that we needed to have multiple slates of electors, and I think the US Congress should have fought over it from there.”</p>
<p>In 2020, Vance alleged that the 2020 election was stolen and that Biden’s immigration policy <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2022/apr/08/jd-vance/jd-vances-ad-about-open-border-and-immigrant-voter/">meant</a> “more Democrat voters pouring into this country”. In 2022, he suggested that Democrats were attempting to “transform the electorate” amid an immigrant “invasion”.</p>
<p>Echoing the so-called “great replacement theory”, Vance <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/16/buffalo-massacre-great-replacement-theory-republicans">told</a> voters, “You’re talking about a shift in the democratic makeup of this country that would mean we never win, meaning Republicans would never win a national election in this country ever again.”</p>
<p>In contrast to Trump, who has no ideology except accumulating power and wealth for himself and taking revenge on those who would deny these to him, Vance <em>does</em> have an ideology. He’s the emerging leader of the anti-democracy movement in the US.</p>
<p>Vance would never have become a senator from Ohio in 2022 were it not for the billionaire tech financier <a data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/peter-thiel">Peter Thiel</a>, who staked $15m on Vance’s election – a major portion of all the funds that went into Vance’s race.</p>
<p>Thiel knew what he was buying. Vance had worked for Thiel’s California venture capital firm before running for the Senate and was part of Thiel’s libertarian community of rich crypto bros, tech executives, back-to-the-landers and disaffected far-right intellectuals.</p>
<p>Because Thiel had been a major funder of Trump’s 2016 presidential run, he had significant influence with Trump when urging him to pick Vance for his vice-president.</p>
<p>Why has Thiel been such a strong sponsor of Vance? Because Thiel sees in his protege a future leader of a political movement to turn the US away from democracy. “For Peter,” <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/07/28/jd-vance-peter-thiel-donors-big-tech-trump-vp/">said</a> one of the people familiar with his thinking, “Vance is a generational bet.”</p>
<p>Thiel is a self-styled libertarian who once <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.cato-unbound.org/2009/04/13/peter-thiel/education-libertarian/">wrote</a>: “I no longer believe that freedom and democracy are compatible.”</p>
<p>Hello? Freedom is incompatible with democracy only if you view democracy as a potential constraint on your wealth and power.</p>
<figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement"><a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/oct/03/jd-vance-anti-democracy-movement-leader#EmailSignup-skip-link-16"><p>skip past newsletter promotion</p></a></figure>
<p>That’s the point. Thiel and Vance – along with Elon Musk, Steve Bannon, Blake Masters, tech entrepreneur David Sacks, Palantir co-founder Joe Lonsdale, Palantir adviser Jacob Helberg, Sequoia Capital’s Doug Leone, blogger Curtis Yarvin, and others in the anti-democracy movement – believe that the only way true libertarians can win in the US is for a Caesar-like figure to wrest power from the US establishment and install a monarchical regime, run like a startup.</p>
<p>Yarvin comes as close as anyone as being the intellectual godfather of the anti-democracy movement. He <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://academic.oup.com/book/25370/chapter-abstract/192453833?redirectedFrom=fulltext">has written</a> that real political power in the United States is held by a liberal amalgam of universities and the mainstream press, whose commitment to equality and justice is eroding social order.</p>
<p>In Yarvin’s view, democratic governments are inefficient and wasteful; they should be replaced with sovereign joint-stock corporations whose major “shareholders” select an executive with total power, who serves at their pleasure. Yarvin refers to the city-state of Singapore as an example of a successful authoritarian regime.</p>
<p>How to achieve Yarvin’s vision? The first step, as Vance <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2022/04/inside-the-new-right-where-peter-thiel-is-placing-his-biggest-bets">offered</a> in a 2021 podcast, is to replace “every single midlevel bureaucrat, every civil servant in the administrative state … with our people. And when the courts stop you, stand before the country, and say” – as did Andrew Jackson – that “the chief justice has made his ruling. Now let him enforce it.”</p>
<p>Vance has been anointed by Thiel and the rest of the anti-democracy movement as the post-Trump president, tasked with replacing the US establishment with an authoritarian regime.</p>
<p>Make no mistake: the foundation for the US’s first anti-democracy president is being laid right now.</p>
