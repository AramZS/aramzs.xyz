<p>Kansas City police Officer Matt Masters first used a Taser in the early 2000s. He said it worked well for taking people down; it was safe and effective.</p>
<p>“At the end of the day, if you have to put your hands on somebody, you got to scuffle with somebody, why risk that?” he said. “You can just shoot them with a Taser.”</p>
<p>Masters believed in that until his son Bryce was pulled over by an officer and shocked for more than 20 seconds. The 17-year-old went into cardiac arrest, which doctors later attributed to the Taser. Masters’ training had led him to believe something like that could never happen.</p>
<p>This week on <em>Reveal</em>, we partner with Lava for Good’s podcast <em>Absolute: Taser Incorporated</em> and its host, Nick Berardini, to learn what the company that makes the Taser knew about the dangers of its weapon and didn’t say.</p>
