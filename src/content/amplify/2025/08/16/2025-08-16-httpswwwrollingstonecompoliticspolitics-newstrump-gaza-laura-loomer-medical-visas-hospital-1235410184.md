<p><a data-tag="donald-trump" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/donald-trump/">Donald Trump</a>’s administration stopped all visitor visas from <a data-tag="gaza" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/gaza/">Gaza</a> — including those for humanitarian and medical aid — on Saturday after far-right provocateur and Trump friend <a data-tag="laura-loomer" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/laura-loomer/">Laura Loomer</a> posted about several Palestinian children being allowed into the U.S. for medical care amid <a data-tag="israel" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/israel/">Israel</a>’s relentless siege and blockade.</p>
<p>The <a data-tag="state-department" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/state-department/">State Department</a> said it will “conduct a full and thorough review of the process and procedures used to issue a small number of temporary medical-humanitarian visas in recent days,” in a <a href="https://x.com/StateDept/status/1956717342693458359">post on X</a>.</p>
<p>“It’s amazing how fast we can get results from the Trump administration,” Loomer <a href="https://x.com/LauraLoomer/status/195672317731869948">wrote on X</a>, adding an applause emoji.”</p>
<p>Loomer <a href="https://x.com/LauraLoomer/status/1956447870175121475">posted a video</a> Friday showing children from Gaza arriving in San Francisco for treatment, greeted by a cheering crowd. Loomer called the video an “exclusive,” posting it to X with her watermark on it, despite it being posted on August 6 by the nonprofit HEAL Palestine, which provides medical care to <a data-tag="palestinians" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/palestinians/">Palestinians</a>.</p>
<p>“How did Palestinians get Visas under the Trump administration to get into the United States? Did <a href="https://x.com/StateDept">@StateDept</a> approve this? How did they get out of Gaza? Is <a href="https://x.com/SecRubio">@SecRubio</a> aware of this?” she <a href="https://x.com/LauraLoomer/status/1956447870175121475">asked Friday</a>.</p>
<p>The caption of the August 6 video reads, “Leyan, Ghazal, and their siblings will [begin] medical treatment and school as soon as possible under the care of HEAL.”</p>
<p>Loomer messages <em>Rolling Stone </em>on Saturday afternoon: “The MAGA base didn’t vote for more Islamic immigration into the United States. I applaud Secretary of State <a data-tag="marco-rubio" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/marco-rubio/">Marco Rubio</a> for halting the Visas of Gazans from a HAMAS hot zone and look forward to seeing the State Department’s review of the rogue State Department employees who signed off on visas for Gazans who have shown a disrespect for American life as Hamas continues to hold hostages.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/injured-children-gaza-bay-area-treatment/3929935/">According to</a> NBC Bay Area, Leyan is a 14-year-old who was burned and injured by shrapnel in an explosion at her school. Ghazal, 6, was also hurt in an explosion. Another child who arrived, 8-year-old Anas, was hurt in an explosion that killed his entire family. There were 11 children in total evacuated, the <a href="https://www.healpalestine.org/impact-story/11-wounded-children-from-gaza-arrive-in-the-u-s-in-largest-medical-evacuation-to-date/">largest medical evacuation</a> of injured children from Gaza to the U.S.</p>
<p>“The logistics of getting them out is also a nightmare,” Talha Baquar of HEAL Palestine <a href="https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/injured-children-gaza-bay-area-treatment/3929935/">told NBC Bay Area</a>. “The Israeli government has to approve of their release. One of the children who’s coming today, he’s been on a waitlist to get out. He’s had his medical visa since November of last year.”</p>
<p>“These children could not wait,” Dr. Zeena Salman, pediatric oncologist and co-founder of HEAL Palestine, <a href="https://www.healpalestine.org/impact-story/11-wounded-children-from-gaza-arrive-in-the-u-s-in-largest-medical-evacuation-to-date/">said in a statement</a>. “Their lives are at stake, and this mission is about giving them a future.”</p>
<p>After the children receive medical care, they will go to Egypt, where HEAL will continue to support them, <a href="https://www.healpalestine.org/impact-story/11-wounded-children-from-gaza-arrive-in-the-u-s-in-largest-medical-evacuation-to-date/">the organization said</a>. HEAL has evacuated 63 injured children and 148 people total as of August 4, <a href="https://www.healpalestine.org/impact-story/11-wounded-children-from-gaza-arrive-in-the-u-s-in-largest-medical-evacuation-to-date/">according to its website</a>.</p>
<p>Andrew Miller, former U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Israeli-Palestinian Affairs, <a href="https://x.com/andrwpmiller/status/1956781853328712090?s=46">posted on X</a> that the State Department’s move reflected “prejudice.”</p>
<p>“I dealt with such cases during the Biden admin. No one leaves Gaza w/o Israel’s approval &amp; everyone’s vetted through U.S. databases. Any security risk is negligible. This is rank ethnic/religious prejudice. Denying sick people critical medical care is cowardly &amp; depraved.”</p>
<p>Loomer declared victory after the State Department announced it would stop visas from Gaza.</p>
<p>“This is fantastic news,” she <a href="https://x.com/LauraLoomer/status/1956718717762699444">posted on X</a>. “Hopefully all GAZANS will be added to President Trump’s travel ban. There are doctors in other countries. The U.S. is not the world’s <a data-tag="hospital" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/hospital/">hospital</a>!”</p>
<p>“Thank you for bringing attention to this matter, @LauraLoomer,” Jan. 6 rally organizer Caroline Wren <a href="https://x.com/CarolineWren/status/1956730792358404572">wrote on X</a>.</p>
<p>Islamophobic Rep. Randy Fine (R-Fla.) applauded Loomer for posting the video. “Massive credit needs to be given to @LauraLoomer for uncovering this and making me and other officials aware. Well done, Laura,” he <a href="https://x.com/RepFine/status/1956722183473864986">posted on X</a>.</p>
<p>The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) said in a <a href="https://www.cair.com/press_releases/cair-says-state-dept-ban-on-gaza-visas-shows-trump-admins-complicity-with-genocide-intentional-cruelty/">statement</a> that the State Department’s move seemed “intentionally cruel.”</p>
<p>“Blocking Palestinian children injured by American weapons from coming to America for medical treatment is the latest sign that the intentional cruelty of President Trump’s ‘Israel First’ administration knows no bounds,” said CAIR National Executive Director Nihad Awad.</p>
<p>Israel has led a brutal onslaught and near-total blockade in Gaza since October 7, 2023, following the Hamas-led terrorist attacks in Israel. More than 60,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since October 7, Gaza’s Health Ministry <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/over-60000-palestinians-have-died-in-the-israel-hamas-war-gazas-health-ministry-says">said</a> at the end of July. More than 50,000 children in Gaza have been killed or injured during this period, according to UNICEF, and more than one child has been killed per hour, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/interactive/2025/israel-gaza-war-children-death-toll">according to</a> <em>The Washington Post.</em> In April, an Israeli <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjr7l123zy5o">airstrike destroyed</a> part of the last fully functional hospital in Gaza. Israel has tightly restricted food and humanitarian aid allowed into Gaza, creating <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/israel-gaza-aid.html">widespread famine</a> throughout the strip.</p>
<p>Trump previously <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/laura-loomer-trump-administration-job-maga-blowback-1235101932/">called Loomer a “free spirit”</a> when the two traveled together last September, and she continues to privately advise him and others in the administration.</p>
<p>After Trump won in November, various Gazan families and immigration attorneys — who were already largely sickened by the Biden administration’s actions during this conflict — were in panic mode, fearing the worst for how any slivers of relief and options they were offered under the Democratic presidency would evaporate under a second Trump government.</p>
<p>Those fears are being realized, and then some.</p>
<p>“I’ve visited with some of the children in Houston, [Texas], who have been brought here from Gaza for medical treatment,” human rights lawyer Maria Kari <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/trump-gaza-immigration-families-kids-1235240250/">told</a> <em>Rolling Stone</em> in January. “I’m a mother and I don’t know how many diapers you’ve changed. But until this war, I had never seen someone have to change a diaper on a baby — who was just under two years old — who had third-degree burns on the diaper-change area. The sound the baby makes is horrifying. It’s seared into your brain. It haunts you forever. I’ve sat and ate with a girl who had to hold her jaw while we ate because there’s a hole in her jaw and food was falling out while she ate. I’ve sat and painted ceramic dinosaurs with these children — the same things I do with my children — and they’re so beautiful, they’re so cute and resilient. One of them had just buried her baby sister just before she got on a plane to come here.”</p>
<p>This is whom Republicans and their allies are working hard to shun, banish, and deny relief.</p>
