  Mastodon is becoming a nonprofit to ensure it is not controlled by a single
  billionaire. The platform is asking for $5 million in donations to support its
  growth and maintain user control. This change aims to create a safer, ad-free
  space for users frustrated with policies on other social networks.

<figure></figure><figure></figure><p>Mastodon <a href="https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2025/01/the-people-should-own-the-town-square/">announced</a> Monday that it's shifting its structure over the next six months to become wholly owned by a European nonprofit organization—"affirming the intent that Mastodon should not be owned or controlled by a single individual."</p>
<p>This takes control of the social network away from its previous "ultimate decision-maker," Eugen Rochko. As founder, Rochko initially took the reins to ensure the decentralized platform would never be for sale and "would be free of the control of a single wealthy individual." His grand vision remains to leave Mastodon users in control of the social network, making their own decisions about what content is allowed or what appears in their timelines.</p>
<p>The news comes after leaders of other social networks, like Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk, have sparked backlash over sudden changes to popular apps like Facebook, Instagram, and X (formerly Twitter). For years, Musk has drawn criticism for changing Twitter's hate speech policies through his X rebranding. And more recently, Zuckerberg this month <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/meta-kills-diversity-programs-claiming-dei-has-become-too-charged/">defended Meta's decision to relax hate speech policies</a> (permitting women to be called "property" and gay people to be called "mentally ill") by calling bans on such speech "out of touch with mainstream discourse."</p>
<p>Mastodon is hoping to provide an alternative social network for users who are potentially frustrated with their lack of control over their timelines and content on other networks.</p>
<p>But to achieve the "envisioned independence" for all users, Mastodon's structure needed to "evolve," the blog said, "as the community grew" to about <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/reports/Mastodon%20Annual%20Report%202023.pdf">1.5 million monthly active users</a> in 2023. Remaining headquartered in Europe primarily, Mastodon's day-to-day operations will be managed by the new European not-for-profit entity, "establishing a new legal home for Mastodon."</p>
<p>The user experience on Mastodon won't be affected much by the transition to a nonprofit owner, Mastodon said. But "changes are definitely in the pipeline."</p>
<p>Mastodon appears to be betting that even more users will seek alternative social networks in the future as popular apps enact unpopular policies. The blog discussed progress on a "privacy-respecting search tool" that could be used to explore the entire Fediverse, a collection of independent social media networks that Mastodon connects to. That could make it possible to discover more content without depending on a "For You" algorithm mining user data.</p>
<p>And perhaps in a nod to Meta's recent changes, Mastodon also vowed to "invest deeply in trust and safety" and ensure "everyone, especially marginalized communities," feels "safe" on the platform.</p>
<p>To become a more user-focused paradise of "resilient, governable, open and safe digital spaces," Mastodon is going to need a lot more funding. The blog called for donations to help fund an annual operating budget of $5.1 million (5 million euros) in 2025. That's a massive leap from the $152,476 (149,400 euros) total operating expenses Mastodon reported in 2023.</p>
<h2>Other social networks wary of EU regulations</h2>
<p>Mastodon has decided to continue basing its operations in Europe, while still maintaining a separate US-based nonprofit entity as a "fundraising hub," the blog said.</p>
<p>It will take time, Mastodon said, to "select the appropriate jurisdiction and structure in Europe" before Mastodon can then "determine which other (subsidiary) legal structures are needed to support operations and sustainability."</p>
<p>While Mastodon is carefully getting re-settled as a nonprofit in Europe, Zuckerberg this week went on Joe Rogan's podcast to call on Donald Trump to help US tech companies fight European Union fines, Politico <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/zuckerberg-urges-trump-to-stop-eu-from-screwing-with-fining-us-tech-companies/">reported</a>.</p>
<p>Some critics suggest the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/meta-kills-diversity-programs-claiming-dei-has-become-too-charged/">recent policy changes</a> on Meta platforms were intended to win Trump's favor, partly to get Trump on Meta's side in the fight against the EU's strict digital laws. According <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20250108-us-tech-titans-ramp-up-pressure-on-eu">to France24</a>, Musk's recent combativeness with EU officials suggests Musk might team up with Zuckerberg in that fight (unlike that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/08/zuck-musk-cage-match-canceled-tech-billionaires-blame-each-other/">cage fight pitting the wealthy tech titans against each other that never happened</a>).</p>
<p>Experts <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20250108-can-eu-stand-up-to-belligerent-big-tech-in-new-trump-era">told France24</a> that EU officials may "perhaps wrongly" already be fearful about ruffling Trump's feathers by targeting his tech allies and would likely need to use the "full legal arsenal" of EU digital laws to "stand up to Big Tech" once Trump's next term starts.</p>
<p>As Big Tech prepares to continue battling EU regulators, Mastodon appears to be taking a different route, laying roots in Europe and "establishing the appropriate governance and leadership frameworks that reflect the nature and purpose of Mastodon as a whole" and "responsibly serve the community," its blog said.</p>
<p>"Our core mission remains the same: to create the tools and digital spaces where people can build authentic, constructive online communities free from ads, data exploitation, manipulative algorithms, or corporate monopolies," Mastodon's blog said.</p>
