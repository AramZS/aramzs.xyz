  The attack on trans rights under Trump's presidency threatens the rights of
  all marginalized groups. Discrimination against trans people can set a
  dangerous precedent for other communities. Once legal protections begin to
  erode for one group, they are at risk for everyone.

This is why, just a few short days into his presidency, Donald Trump <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://19thnews.org/2025/01/trump-transgender-executive-order/">is already making good</a> on his promise to persecute trans people zealously. On Monday, Trump issued an executive order purging trans service members <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/prioritizing-military-excellence-and-readiness/">from the military on the grounds</a> that “expressing a false ‘gender identity’ divergent from an individual’s sex cannot satisfy the rigorous standards necessary for military service,” a statement belied by the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7906232/#:~:text=It%20is%20estimated%2C%20however%2C%20that,reduce%20willingness%20to%20seek%20gender%2D">thousands serving honorably</a> until they were singled out for discrimination by their commander in chief. A day later, Trump issued a second executive order that could make g<a data-event-element="inline link" data-sk="tooltip_parent" data-stringify-link="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/01/donald-trump-new-executive-order-gender-affirming-care-trans-youth-children-teenagers/" delay="150" href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/01/donald-trump-new-executive-order-gender-affirming-care-trans-youth-children-teenagers/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ender-affirming care for young people</a> unavailable in most of the country.</p><p>The damage wrought by legitimizing this form of discrimination will not be limited to the trans community. Laws and legal rulings that undermine trans rights may soon be used to restrict the rights of other, less marginal groups. Anyone naive enough to think that the government can deny fundamental rights to one group without putting another’s at risk is in for some nasty surprises. That much became clear during oral arguments at the Supreme Court in December over Tennessee’s ban on gender-affirming care for minors.</p><p>At issue in the case, <i>United States v. Skrmetti</i>, is whether <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://casetext.com/statute/tennessee-code/title-68-health-safety-and-environmental-protection/health/chapter-33-health-and-welfare-of-minors/section-68-33-103-prohibitions">Tennessee’s ban on medical treatments</a> for gender dysphoria—the medical diagnosis for someone who believes their gender does not match their biological sex—unconstitutionally discriminates on the basis of sex. The <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://legiscan.com/TN/text/SB0001/id/2755783">Tennessee bill</a> declares that “this state has a legitimate, substantial, and compelling interest in encouraging minors to appreciate their sex,” and therefore in preventing medical treatments that “encourage minors to become disdainful of their sex.” Implicit in this is the belief that if you don’t “appreciate your sex,” then the state should force you to. Beyond the legal jargon and pretext, the underlying conflict here is between conservatives who have concluded that trans identity is a social contagion to be eradicated and that using state power for this cause is legitimate, and their opponents, who believe that trans people are entitled to equal protection under the law.</p><p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/12/why-supreme-court-puberty-blockers/680998/">Read: The push for puberty blockers got ahead of the research</a></p><p>Crucially, the law bans treatments—such as hormones and puberty blockers—only for the purpose of a minor’s gender transition; they remain legal to prescribe for any other reason. The law bans treatments that enable “a minor to identify with, or live as, a purported identity inconsistent with the minor’s sex.” Because those same medications are available as long as they are not used for gender-affirming care, lawyers for the Biden administration argued that the ban constitutes discrimination on the basis of sex. The Biden administration’s position was that this kind of care can be regulated—then–Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar cited as a legitimate example a West Virginia law that requires two physicians to sign off—but that the regulation cannot be discriminatory. Not all measures that distinguish on the basis of sex are unconstitutional—see, for instance, sex-specific bathrooms—but they are subject to greater legal scrutiny; Tennessee is denying that it is engaging in discrimination, and thus not subject to that level of scrutiny.</p><p>One might question why this case matters if you are not yourself trans or do not have a loved one who is. The number of trans people is objectively small—less than a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/publications/trans-adults-united-states/">fraction of 1 percent</a> of the population. A recent <i>JAMA Pediatrics</i> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://apnews.com/article/transgender-hormones-puberty-blockers-youth-562cba3c3ae43e88d5144f7adb4efd7c">study</a> found that fewer than 0.1 percent of young people with private insurance received hormone treatments or puberty blockers during a five-year period—a limited number of patients overall, but one for whom <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2022/01/mental-health-hormone-treatment-transgender-people.html">the stakes are very high</a>. The outcome of this case has much broader implications than it might appear, because if a state can, as Prelogar put it, force people to “look and live like boys and girls,” subject to the government’s definition of what that means, then a lot more people might be affected. As Justice Sonia Sotomayor pointed out during oral argument, for many years, some states prevented women from becoming butchers or lawyers. Women could not have their own <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.npr.org/2024/10/28/nx-s1-5163432/smithsonians-new-series-is-tied-to-50th-anniversary-of-equal-credit-opportunity-act">credit cards or bank accounts</a> until the 1970s. If it’s not unconstitutional sex discrimination for the government to say that people cannot behave “inconsistent with their sex,” well now you’re <i>really</i> talking about a lot of people—a lot more people than the rather tiny population included in the category of “they/them” that the Trump campaign was hoping you feel disgust and contempt for.</p><p>Much depends on the nature of the justices’ ultimate decision and how far-reaching it is. The conservative movement’s mobilization against trans rights, however, is just one step in a wider rolling-back of other antidiscrimination protections. Conservatives have consciously targeted a diminutive, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/16/us/politics/transgender-conservative-campaign.html">politically powerless segment</a> of the population, trying to strip them of their constitutional rights, and then used those legal precedents to undermine laws that prevent discrimination on the basis of race, religion, sexual orientation, and other characteristics. The trick was making Americans think that only the rights of trans people are on the chopping block, that “they/them” could be persecuted without consequences for “you.” As <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.loc.gov/resource/mss11879.21039/?sp=35&amp;st=image">Frederick Douglass once said</a>, “Slavery lives in this country not because of any paper Constitution, but in the moral blindness of the American people, who persuade themselves that they are safe, though the rights of others may be struck down.”</p><p>“One of the things that’s worth emphasizing is that for the people who brought the case, the movement that’s behind this litigation, there have long been anxieties about sex-discrimination jurisprudence, period,” Mary Ziegler, a professor at UC Davis School of Law, told me. “So if that’s the agenda that’s driving the litigation, and the Court is embracing the arguments behind that agenda, you have to wonder if this isn’t the end of the road.”</p><p>The harm to antidiscrimination law more broadly could be immense. Many of the rationales offered by the conservative justices during oral argument echo the reasoning of those opposed to bans on racial discrimination. If they regain legitimacy, they could later be used to weaken other laws that protect Americans from bigotry.</p><p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/05/a-scalia-decision-sets-the-precedent-for-why-hb2-is-illegal/481569/">Read: Anti-trans discrimination is sex discrimination</a></p><p>For example, defenders of Tennessee’s ban have said that it does not discriminate based on sex, because it prohibits gender-affirming care to both boys and girls—a point Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett raised during oral argument. Similar assertions were made in defense of interracial-marriage bans, which prevented both Black and white people from marrying their chosen spouses. “If we’re reinstating the equal-application theory … that was a theory that was used historically to uphold and justify race-based distinctions,” Melissa Murray, a law professor at NYU, told me. “I don’t know how you can wall off sex discrimination from race discrimination if you’re reviving this equal-treatment claim.”</p><p>Kavanaugh suggested that because the case involved medical science, the Court should just leave it to the “democratic process,” an approach that Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson pointedly observed would have prevented the Court from striking down bans on interracial marriage, because at the time, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/388/1/">Virginia had argued</a> that the “science” regarding interracial marriage “was substantially in doubt,” and therefore banning it should be up to the voters. The point of equal protection is to prevent fundamental rights from being subject to mere popularity contests—especially when, as Justice Sotomayor pointed out, the population at risk is so few as to be politically powerless.</p><p>The Trump administration’s early actions make clear that exploiting voters’ fears about trans people was part of a larger plan to undermine antidiscrimination protections for many other people, even as they intend to make the lives of millions of others—including many of Trump’s own supporters—much worse. Among the first actions taken by the administration was the repeal of the Lyndon B. Johnson–era directive <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.axios.com/2025/01/22/trump-dei-lbj-rollback">ordering federal contractors</a> to avoid discriminating on the basis of race, as well as subsequent orders barring discrimination on the basis of gender. The administration has also frozen all new <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/01/22/justice-civil-rights-freeze-shutdown/">cases in the civil-rights division of the Justice Department</a>. Trump has also <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/22/us/politics/trump-dei-diversity-officials-orders.html">ended all federal-government diversity efforts</a> and intends to fire employees involved in them. The administration’s <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-place-federal-dei-staff-paid-leave-starting-wednesday-2025-01-22/">executive order on DEI also threatens to sue companies</a> for having diversity programs, a threat that will encourage companies to resegregate to avoid being accused of anti-white discrimination. Trump has shut down the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-white-house-spanish-language-website-62224890c5b05c8ce0878358ba4a5266">White House’s Spanish-language website</a>, ended refugee- and humanitarian-parole programs, and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/01/trump-executive-order-citizenship/681404/">unconstitutionally attempted to nullify birthright citizenship</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2025/01/trump-targets-his-own-government/681413/">Read: Trump targets his own government</a></p><p>Even before Trump took office, Republican-controlled states passed laws that <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/08/freedom-speech-mississippi-abortion-rights/671202/">curtail women’s rights to free speech</a>, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2024/11/texas-red-state-surveillance-book-bans-abortion/679950/">privacy, and movement</a> on the grounds that those restrictions are necessary to ban abortion—something that, as Justice Samuel Alito took pains to reiterate during oral argument in <i>Skrmetti</i>, neither he nor his colleagues in the conservative movement regard as sex-based discrimination.</p><p>This agenda has, by the Republicans’ own account, been partly enabled by their success at demonizing transgender people in the November election. Trans people are a group few in number and marginalized enough that there is little political cost at the moment to persecuting them as Republicans have, or blaming them for their political misfortunes and abandoning them as Democrats have following their electoral loss. One transgender congressional representative was enough for Republicans to demand that all of the Capitol’s bathrooms be restricted by “biological sex.” The tiny <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://apnews.com/article/transgender-hormones-puberty-blockers-youth-562cba3c3ae43e88d5144f7adb4efd7c">percentage of trans children receiving care</a> is justification to ban them from accessing treatment they seek. A defense-funding bill passed with limited Democratic support and signed by President Joe Biden will ban gender-affirming care <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.hrc.org/press-releases/president-biden-signs-defense-bill-blocking-health-care-for-trans-military-children-first-anti-lgbtq-federal-law-enacted-since-defense-of-marriage-act">for the children of service members</a>—for those with trans children, their reward for serving their country is that their children will be discriminated against. If they are stationed in states like Texas, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://gov.texas.gov/organization/military/installations">which has no less than 15</a> military installations, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.texastribune.org/2023/06/02/texas-gender-affirming-care-ban/">they will have few options, if any</a>, for care outside the military system.</p><p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2024/11/democrats-dishonest-gender-conversation-2024-election/680604/">Read: The Democrats need an honest conversation on gender identity</a></p><p>This is shameless bullying, but then, the president is himself a bully of the highest order, and presidents are moral exemplars, for better and worse. It is not necessary for one to approve of gender-affirming care in order to respect people’s right to make their own decisions about what medical care is best for them and their families, or to oppose this kind of outright, ideologically motivated state persecution.</p><p>Over the past century, many groups have successfully sought to have their rights recognized, winning, at least on paper, the same rights as white, Christian, heterosexual men. The right-wing project today, which Trumpist justices support, is to reestablish by state force the hierarchies of race, gender, and religion they deem moral and foundational. Whether that’s <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.npr.org/2022/10/21/1130297123/national-dont-say-gay-stop-children-sexualization-bill">forcing LGBTQ people back into the closet</a>, compelling women to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://apnews.com/article/divorce-nofault-repeal-republican-states-40d6c51bd26b7d8c6a2d4969b21d4b53">remain in loveless marriages</a>, or confining Black and Hispanic people to the drudgery of—as Trump once put it—“<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/04/business/black-job-employment-data/index.html">Black jobs</a>” and “Hispanic jobs” in which they are meant to toil, the purpose of this ideological project is the same: to put the broader mass of people back in their “proper places.” To those who see the world this way, freedom means the freedom of the majority to oppress the minority. Attacking trans people first was simply their plan for getting the American people on board with taking many other freedoms away.</p></body></html>
