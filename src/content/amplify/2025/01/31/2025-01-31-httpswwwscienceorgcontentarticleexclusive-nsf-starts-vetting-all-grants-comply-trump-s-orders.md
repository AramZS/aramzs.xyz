  The National Science Foundation (NSF) is reviewing all its grant projects to
  comply with President Trump's directives, causing a funding freeze that
  disrupts academic research. Many scientists worry about the impact on their
  work, especially projects focused on diversity and environmental issues. NSF
  has also stopped accepting proposals for some long-standing programs that may
  conflict with these new orders.

<h2>Grantee accounts remain frozen, while union accuses NSF of ignoring rules governing peer review</h2>

<p>In a radical break with tradition, the National Science Foundation (NSF) this week began to search through billions of dollars of grants the agency has already awarded for anything touching on topics that President Donald Trump has criticized. And NSF has blocked grantees and trainees from accessing funds while the review is underway, wreaking havoc across the academic research community.</p>
<p>The funding freeze and vetting of research and training projects that NSF previously decided were worthy of support is a response to a slew of presidential directives since 20 January that ban all federal funding for what Trump considers to be “woke gender ideology;” diversity, equity, and inclusion; foreign aid; the green new deal; and support for nongovernmental organizations that undermine the national interest. For academic scientists, the list of banned activities could include efforts to increase diversity in the scientific workforce, collaborations with foreign scientists, and research on more environmentally friendly technologies.</p>
<p>Agencies have taken different routes to comply with those orders. NASA, for example, which runs a tiny handful of affected programs compared with NSF, sent out a memo last week telling all NASA contractors and awardees to “immediately cease and desist all DEIA [diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility] activities required of their contracts or grants.” In contrast, the Department of Energy’s $8 billion Office of Science decided this week to drop its requirement that scientists submit a Promoting Inclusive and Equitable Research (PIER) plan as part of their application. It also said PIER plans in research proposals already under review would be ignored.</p>
<p>At NSF, Science has learned that officials have temporarily blocked institutions and scientific organizations from getting access to money they have been promised while vetting projects. The agency has provided no indication of how long that review will take. That has left investigators wondering how to meet payrolls and buy and maintain essential equipment and supplies.</p>
<p>“We’re in a holding pattern,” says Maria Miriti, an ecologist at Ohio State University with a $500,000 NSF grant to build an undergraduate network to increase diversity in the field. “The network exists,” says Miriti, who also has an NSF grant to study plant-soil interactions in arid regions. “But if NSF says no, will we have to return some of the money?”</p>
<p>The reviews have also roiled the NSF workforce. Program officers—typically Ph.D. scientists who are either permanent federal employees or on leave from their college or university—have been asked to examine the projects they manage for any offending language and then go over their findings with their supervisor. But they haven’t received any written guidance on what criteria to use in deciding whether a grant violates a presidential directive and should be terminated.</p>
<p>NSF staff are now at risk of having to ignore both statute and long-standing NSF policies on how the agency makes awards, warns the head of the union chapter that represents NSF employees. And that could put them in legal jeopardy.</p>
<p>“Is NSF asking federal scientists to behave unethically?” asks Jesus Soriano, president of Local 3403 of the American Federation of Government Employees. “And if they violate the merit review process, will they be liable for recommending that an award be canceled because of the political review criteria that NSF is asking them to follow?”</p>
<p>“The union realizes that NSF is between a rock and a hard place in complying with the executive orders,” adds Soriano, a program officer within NSF’s engineering directorate. The merit review process “does not include words such as woke or green new deal or gender ideology. Those words aren’t in the grant, and I don’t even know what they mean.”</p>
<p>A <a href="https://new.nsf.gov/executive-orders">29 January notice on NSF’s website</a> appears to put the burden on institutions to identify and then halt any NSF-funded research that clashes with the executive orders. “All NSF grantees must comply with these executive orders, and any other relevant executive orders issued, by ceasing all noncompliant grant and award activities,” it states, reinforcing the existing requirement that grant recipients must abide by all the “terms and conditions” of the grant. NSF declined a request from <em>Science</em> to explain how its vetting relates to what it expects grantees to do and whether projects that have been flagged will be canceled and their unspent balances returned to the government.</p>
<p>In addition to vetting its portfolio of 40,000 individual grants, NSF has taken the preemptive step of ending an unknown number of programs supporting work that might be seen as violating the new directives. Its decision to “archive” those programs, some of which have run for decades, means the NSF is no longer accepting proposals on those topics.</p>
<p>NSF declined to comment on the number of archived programs, how they were selected, or what will happen to the funds that had been allocated to those programs.</p>
