<p>Barely a few months after <a href="https://www.status.news/p/jay-penske-pmc-return-to-office">imposing</a> a new return-to-office mandate—a move seen internally as an effort to thin the ranks—<strong>Jay Penske</strong> has quietly moved to initiate another round of cuts within his <strong>Hollywood</strong> media empire, <em>Status</em> has learned. On Monday, <strong>Rolling Stone</strong> laid off at least two writers, including <strong>Andre Gee</strong> and <strong>Brittany Spanos</strong>. According to Gee, his layoff was unexpected, and the outlet’s “recent merger with <strong>VIBE</strong> eliminated the need” for his position.</p>
<p>"This termination leaves me in immediate peril,” Gee wrote on a <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/offering-support-after-rolling-stone-layoff">GoFundMe page</a> seeking donations in the wake of his exit. “My salary was not commensurate with New York’s tremendous cost of living, so I haven’t been able to amass the savings needed to weather this period."</p>
<p>Staffers at Rolling Stone weren’t alone. Last week, at least three employees at the <strong>Penske Media Corporation</strong>-owned <strong>Variety</strong> were also quietly let go, including…</p>

<p><strong><em>Trump's CNN Ultimatum: </em></strong><strong>Donald Trump</strong>, taking a page straight from the autocratic playbook, declared on Wednesday that any transaction involving <strong>Warner Bros. Discovery’s </strong>assets <em>must</em> include <strong>CNN</strong>. “I think it’s imperative that CNN be sold,” Trump fumed, inserting himself directly into the <strong>Netflix</strong>-vs-<strong>Paramount</strong> bidding war over the future of the <strong>David Zaslav</strong>–led conglomerate. He then unloaded on the network, accusing it of “spreading poison” and calling it a “disgrace,” while smearing the people “running CNN” as “either corrupt or incompetent.” (Apparently <strong>Mark Thompson’s</strong> recent<strong> White House </strong>visit didn’t buy much goodwill.)</p>
<p><em>🔍 Zooming in: </em>Of course, while outrageous, it's not surprising Trump is fixated on CNN's future in the WBD auction. He has long villainized the news organization and sought to break its back. What is cause for concern is that Trump's remarks aren't happening in a vacuum.
