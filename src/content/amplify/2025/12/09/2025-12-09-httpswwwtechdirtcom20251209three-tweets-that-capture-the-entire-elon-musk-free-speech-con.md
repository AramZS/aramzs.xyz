<h3>from the <i>a-story-in-three-acts</i> dept</h3>
<p>We’ve spent <em>years</em> <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2024/08/16/can-we-finally-stop-pretending-elon-musk-is-a-free-speech-absolutist-hes-not/">calling out</a> what <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2024/12/30/free-speech-absolutist-elon-musk-suspends-critics-on-extwitter-asks-people-to-be-nicer/">a hypocrite</a> Elon Musk is <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2024/01/16/free-speech-experts-realizing-just-how-big-a-free-speech-hypocrite-elon-is/">on free speech</a>. But sometimes the universe Elon hands you a gift: three tweets in the span of a little over a week that demonstrate the entire con more clearly than any deep dive ever could. Let’s start with this one:</p>
<figure><img alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" src="https://i0.wp.com/lex-img-p.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/img/aa877c10-5242-45aa-b4d3-fd86de3da70a-RackMultipart20251208-185-u4gvsw.png?ssl=1"/></figure>
<p>That’s Elon announcing that:</p>
<blockquote> <p><em>Falsely labeling non-violent people as “fascist” or “Nazi” should be treated as incitement to murder</em></p> </blockquote>
<p>Which is, to be clear, an extreme anti-free speech position. It’s an extremely censorial stance.</p>
<p>Yes, free speech allows you to refer to someone as a Nazi. As the ACLU has written: <a href="https://www.aclu.org/news/free-speech/theres-no-such-thing-right-not-be-called-nazi">there’s no such thing as a right not to be called a Nazi</a>. There are plenty of legal cases where this has been made clear by judges. Here’s <a href="https://reason.com/volokh/2024/02/12/no-libel-or-emotional-distress-discovery-for-being-called-a-nazi/">just one</a>:</p>
<blockquote> <p><em>Statements indicating a political opponent is a Nazi or coward are “odious and repugnant” and far too common in today’s political discourse. But they are not actionable defamation “because of the tremendous imprecision of the meaning and usage of such terms in the realm of political debate.” In other words, being called a Nazi or coward are not verifiable statements of fact that would support a defamation claim</em></p> </blockquote>
<p>So, already, we see that Elon is taking an anti-free speech stance with that tweet. Political hyperbole, even of the Nazi-calling variety, is protected speech. Always has been.</p>
<p>Now keep that tweet in mind as we head into the next one.</p>
<p>Because over the weekend… Elon Musk pretty clearly falsely called the EU Commission (which just fined him)… Nazis.</p>
<figure><img alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" src="https://i0.wp.com/lex-img-p.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/img/e8780354-2af1-4baf-85ff-cd2196826fd6-RackMultipart20251208-214-brw9xx.png?ssl=1"/></figure>
<p>If you can’t see that, it’s Elon retweeting someone who posted an image of the EU flag being pulled back to reveal a Nazi flag. The original poster says “The Fourth Reich” and Elon’s quote tweet says: “Pretty much.”</p>
<p>So, let’s recap: falsely calling non-violent people Nazis is, according to Elon, “incitement to murder” and yet here he is… falsely calling non-violent people Nazis. Just a week after that original statement.</p>
<p>And then there’s the third act that ties it all together. I know he’s said this one before in similar forms, but this weekend he also claimed that the “Surefire way to figure out who the bad guys are is by looking who wants to restrict freedom of speech.”</p>
<figure><img alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" src="https://i0.wp.com/lex-img-p.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/img/68e8307d-4bea-42bb-89e5-9ad73a73b7f9-RackMultipart20251208-231-aabxhr.png?ssl=1"/></figure>
<p>So, uh, yeah. Just a week after Elon says that labeling a non-violent person a Nazi should be considered “incitement to murder” (an inherent attempt to suppress speech of critics), he claims that the easiest way to figure out who are “the bad guys” is to see who wants to suppress speech.</p>
<p>According to Elon’s own standard: he is the bad guy. He is saying that we should suppress speech of those who call him a Nazi. And therefore, he is a bad guy. By his own logic.</p>
<p>The pattern is obvious. Elon’s entire incoherent “free speech” framework collapses into a single, coherent principle: <strong>speech I like is protected, speech I don’t like should be punished</strong>. He wants the freedom to call the EU Commission Nazis. He wants to criminalize anyone who calls him one. He proclaims that those who restrict speech are “the bad guys” while simultaneously arguing that calling him a Nazi should be treated as incitement to murder—a severe restriction on speech. And when he or his allies do <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/21/the-gesture-speaks-for-itself-germans-divided-over-musks-apparent-nazi-salute">actual Nazi-like things</a>? Well, you better not mention it, or you’re inciting violence.</p>
<p>This is what happens when someone who has never understood the actual principles of free speech tries to cosplay as a free speech absolutist. The mask doesn’t just slip—it falls off entirely, and all that’s left is the naked self-interest underneath.</p>
