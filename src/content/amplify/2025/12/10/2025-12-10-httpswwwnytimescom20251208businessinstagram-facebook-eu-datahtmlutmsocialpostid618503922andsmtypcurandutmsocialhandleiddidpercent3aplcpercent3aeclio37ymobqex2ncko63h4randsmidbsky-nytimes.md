<p>Instagram and Facebook users in the European Union will soon be able to share less personal data with Meta, the social media giant that owns both services, in exchange for receiving ads that are less personalized.</p>
<p>Europeans will be the first users globally with the ability to opt out of the robust data collection system that powers Meta’s advertising network without paying a subscription fee, the European Commission, the executive branch of the 27-nation bloc, <a href="https://digital-markets-act.ec.europa.eu/meta-commits-give-eu-users-choice-personalised-ads-under-dma-2025-12-08_en">announced</a> on Monday.</p>
<p>The option, available next month, aims to resolve a regulatory dispute. In April, Meta was fined 200 million euros for imposing what authorities called a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/23/technology/apple-meta-eu-fines-competition-law.html">“consent or pay”</a> system that forced users to either allow personal data to be used for targeting ads or pay for ad-free versions of Facebook and Instagram.</p>
<p>“Users in the E.U. must have full and effective choice,” the commission said in a statement.</p>
<p>Meta downplayed Monday’s announcement, saying it was making changes to the wording, design and transparency of existing policy.</p>
<p>“We acknowledge the European Commission’s statement,” the company said in a statement, adding that “personalized ads are vital for Europe’s economy.”</p>
<p>Meta is facing more regulatory scrutiny in Brussels. Last week, authorities started an antitrust investigation into a new policy that may prevent certain providers of artificial intelligence tools from offering services through the company’s WhatsApp messaging platform, potentially giving Meta’s A.I. products a leg up on rivals.</p>
<p>Amazon, Google and Microsoft are also facing probes related to allegations over potentially anticompetitive business practices. Last week, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/05/technology/eu-elon-musk-x-140-million-fine.html">regulators fined X</a>, the social media company owned by Elon Musk, $140 million for violating one of the bloc’s major tech laws.</p>
<p>The E.U. is scrutinizing the tech industry even as leaders have proposed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/17/technology/europe-big-tech.html">dialing back certain tech regulations</a> in a bid to boost growth and encourage A.I. development.</p>
<p>The bloc is also facing pressure from the Trump administration, which has said tech regulation is unfairly targeting American companies.</p>
