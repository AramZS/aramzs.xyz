<p>The 401(k) millionaire club is growing.</p>
<p>Steady saving by many Americans and a third consecutive year of big gains for U.S. stocks have swollen account balances. As 2025 comes to a close, many individual investors are finding holiday cheer in statements showing they have crossed the $1 million milestone.</p>
<div>As of the third quarter, there were 654,000 401(k) millionaires at the brokerage Fidelity, the highest level in records going back to the early 2000s. Around 3.2% of more than three million accounts tracked by benefits provider   <a data-type="company" href="https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/ALIT">Alight</a> had balances above $1 million as of the third quarter, double the figure at the end of 2022. At   <a data-type="company" href="https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/TROW">T. Rowe Price</a>, roughly 2.6% of participants had balances above $1 million, up from 1.3% at the end of 2022. </div><p></p>
<div>For the first time, half of private-sector workers are saving in 401(k)s, which allow workers to invest money directly from their paychecks without subtracting income taxes upfront. Many of those accounts are also more tied to the stock market than ever before, with workers in their late 30s   <a data-type="link" href="https://www.wsj.com/personal-finance/retirement/us-401k-retirement-stock-market-84cfe48d?mod=article_inline">allocating roughly 88% to equities</a> last year, up from 82% a decade earlier, according to a Vanguard Group examination of the millions of plans it administers. </div><p></p>
<p>While about 40% of U.S. households are still at risk of being unable to maintain their standard of living in retirement, according to the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College, many of those using 401(k)s are doing better than ever.</p>

<p>“It’s a very sweet place to be,” said John Ward, an 82-year-old retiree in Rye, N.Y., of his rising retirement balance. Around 86% of those with seven-figure balances are 50 years of age or older, typically baby boomers or Gen Xers, according to Fidelity.</p>
<p>Ward considers himself a Boglehead, or a disciple of John Bogle, the Vanguard founder who preached holding index funds and seldom making changes. About half of Ward’s nest egg is invested in the stock market, and the gains have outpaced inflation over the past couple of years. Though he worries about rising healthcare costs and education costs for his grandchildren, affordability hasn’t been a top concern for him.</p>
<p>That approach is increasingly common, with investors stashing money away through inflation, tariff turmoil and economic worries, said Michael Shamrell, vice president of workplace thought leadership at Fidelity. It marks a contrast to some prior moments of economic anxiety, when workers have pulled back from saving. In 2022, for example, the saving rate ticked lower during the market slide that dragged the S&amp;P 500 down 19%.</p>
<p>Even outside of retirement accounts, many everyday Americans have pounced on stock downturns this year to buy the dip.</p>
<p>“They’re a lot less likely to pull back on that match in times of economic uncertainty,” Shamrell said. “A lot of workers understand market ups and downs are part of the deal.”</p>
<p>At Vanguard, the average deferral rate, or percentage of income that participants chose to contribute to their retirement plan, rose to 7.7% in 2024, a record. Almost half of participants increased this payroll deferral rate, in part because of automatic increases, leading to a higher savings rate.</p>
<p>“I was in a review meeting with a plan sponsor the other day where everyone in the room did a double take when we saw the plan balance,” said Mark Hayes, a financial adviser and founder of Infinitive Wealth Advisory in Fishers, Ind.</p>
<div>Still, some of those crossing the milestone find that achieving the million mark might be more of a psychological milestone than a measure of extravagant spending power. Many 401(k) millionaires are part of a growing group that   <a data-type="company" href="https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/UBS">UBS</a> Global Wealth Management dubs the “moderate millionaires,” with assets ranging from $1 million to $5 million. </div><p></p>
<p>UBS estimates that the number of such millionaires around the world has quadrupled since 2000 to 52 million this year. There were around a thousand of these moderate millionaires added every single day in the U.S. last year.</p>
<p>“Popular culture still thinks of millionaires in terms of Scrooge McDuck or the top-hatted icon of Monopoly,” wrote Paul Donovan, chief economist at UBS’s wealth-management practice, in a note to clients this year. “The new dollar millionaires have broken a psychological wealth threshold, but their income and spending is that of middle class households.”</p>
<p>Spending like a “stereotypical millionaire” probably requires at least $5 million, he said.</p>
<p>Carlos Valdivia, 51, said he had aspired to become a millionaire since he earned his M.B.A. degree from Stanford University decades ago. He contributed as much as he could to his retirement accounts.</p>
<p>During times of volatility, he often debated trying elaborate strategies to hedge his exposure to stocks. For the most part, he did nothing.</p>
<p>When he first hit the milestone, he celebrated. “I was like, this is awesome,” said Valdivia, who works in real estate. “I can’t believe we’ve done this.”</p>
<p>Valdivia and his wife love splurging on vacations and Tai Chi classes, but they often still find themselves pinching pennies. For example, he might opt to pick up groceries ordered through the app Instacart to save on fees and tipping a deliveryman. He said he doesn’t feel rich.</p>
<p>“We’re coupon clippers,” he said.</p>
<p>Still, joining the club remains a goal for many, said Angie O’Leary, head of wealth strategies and solutions at RBC Wealth Management. She has noticed more of her clients joining the millionaire club this year.</p>
<p>“Whenever I speak to young kids, I say ‘You can be a millionaire by the time you’re 60 or 65,’ ” O’Leary said.</p>
