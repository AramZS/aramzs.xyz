<p>Across Europe and the United States, the far right is marching as one party. Instead of a collection of isolated movements, they are now acting as a de facto party operating across the West. Their reaction to Charlie Kirk’s recent murder did not create this reality, but it shines a bright light on what was already there.</p>
<p>Long before the attack, the far right had been moving in transnational lockstep. Narratives like the “great replacement”, hostility toward multilateral institutions, and culture-war rhetoric about gender and family roles circulated seamlessly from the US to Europe. Campaign tactics from Hungary, Italy, or the US were quickly localised. Funding networks and US-driven culture-war diplomacy already connected them across borders. Each electoral victory abroad was seized upon as proof of momentum at home. The party without borders was already functioning; Kirk’s death only made it impossible to ignore.</p>
<p>In the days that followed, leaders from Madrid to Budapest to The Hague spoke with striking uniformity. Vox in Spain cast Kirk’s death as proof that conservatives are under siege. Geert Wilders in the Netherlands echoed Kirk’s anti-Islam rhetoric while blaming “leftist tolerance”. Viktor Orbán linked the killing to other alleged attacks on right-wing figures, suggesting a broader campaign of violence against conservatives. Giorgia Meloni’s allies in Italy cast the tragedy as proof that free speech is endangered.</p>
<p>Even in the European Parliament, where emotion is often dampened by procedure, far-right groups moved in concert. They demanded a minute of silence for Kirk. When the <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/news/charlie-kirk-murder-divides-european-parliament/">request was denied</a>, they erupted in protest and transformed the refusal into a rallying cry about institutional bias. What might have been a procedural matter became a symbolic confirmation of their narrative: Liberal institutions refuse to recognise conservative suffering.</p>
<p>This uniformity of reaction is not new behaviour. It is how the far right has been operating for years, absorbing events wherever they occur and reframing them to fit their transnational narrative. Kirk’s killing was simply the latest spark, one that showed how quickly networks mobilise around a storyline of victimhood and persecution.</p>
<p>Some analysts have begun to call this loose but potent network the “Fascintern.” The term recalls the Communist International, which once spread revolutionary ideology across borders. But today’s far-right version has no headquarters in Moscow or anywhere else. Its centre is everywhere and nowhere: in Washington rallies, Brussels corridors, Budapest ministries, Madrid protests, and online echo chambers. Yet one fact cannot be ignored: Vladimir Putin has become its most eager backer.</p>
<p>Through disinformation campaigns, financing streams, and US diplomatic backing, Moscow and Washington have poured fuel on the fire. Russian outlets elevate far-right voices in Europe and North America; Russian proxies channel money into sympathetic parties; Russian diplomats echo their talking points at the UN. Russia is not the architect of the Fascintern, but it is the accelerant.</p>
<p>To be sure, divisions remain. AfD’s flirtation with Moscow clashes with Poland’s suspicion of Russia. Secular ethnonationalists do not always sit comfortably with Catholic traditionalists. Some leaders lean toward protectionism, others toward free-market libertarianism. But these are tactical seams, not ideological chasms. On the fundamentals – identity, immigration, cultural purity, disdain for supranational institutions – the convergence is clear.</p>
<p>That is why continuing to analyse these groups piecemeal obscures more than it reveals. AfD is not just Germany’s problem, Vox is not just Spain’s, and MAGA is not just America’s. They are expressions of a single political current, localised for context but feeding into the same transnational authoritarian project.</p>
<p>The danger is that democrats still respond nationally while the far right already thinks and acts transnationally. Liberal institutions tend to treat each surge of populism as a domestic challenge to be managed within national elections or courts. Meanwhile, the far right amplifies each other’s victories, recycles each other’s talking points, and spreads disinformation through shared channels.</p>
<p>Recognising this shift does not mean exaggerating their unity. It means acknowledging that, in practice, they already function as a party without borders. If they see themselves as part of one struggle, defenders of democracy must do the same. That requires more than technical cooperation. It calls for a strategy of narrative solidarity: coordinated messaging, shared defences against manipulation, and countering US-promoted culture-war exports.</p>
<p>The lesson is clear: The far right’s Fascintern is already here. It has no single leader and no central office, but it moves in unison across continents, fueled by grievance and often amplified by Moscow and Big Tech. Unless liberal democracies learn to coordinate with equal clarity of purpose, they will remain one step behind.</p>
