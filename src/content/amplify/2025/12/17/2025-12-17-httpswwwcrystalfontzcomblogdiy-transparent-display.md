<h2>DIY Transparent Display</h2>
<p> The transparent display we offer for sale (<a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.crystalfontz.com/product/cfal12856a00151b-128x56-transparent-oled-screen" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">CFAL12856A0-0151</a>) is an <a href="https://www.crystalfontz.com/blog/glossary/oled/" target="_self" title="OLED stands for Organic Light Emitting Diode. OLEDs are used to make OLED Displays, which can either be PMOLED (Passive Matrix OLED) or AMOLED (Active Matrix OLED). Crystalfontz carries a full line of OLED modules. Detailed Definition What makes OLEDs useful for display construction is that they can be fabricated in bulk. For instance, to…">OLED</a> (Organic Light Emitting Diode) display. OLED displays produce images by emitting light in the corresponding color. To produce black in a normal OLED, the pixels are simply turned off. With the transparent display, if the pixels are turned off, the display is transparent rather than black.</p>
<p><br/> We’ve heard from a few customers requests for transparent displays with black graphics as well as requests for larger transparent displays. This guide will walk you through creating a transparent display out of a graphic <a href="https://www.crystalfontz.com/blog/glossary/lcd/" target="_self" title="LCD stands for Liquid Crystal Display. An LCD is composed of two pieces of glass with a thin layer of liquid crystals between the glass layers. When a voltage is applied to the glass, the orientation of the crystals can be changed. This change in the crystal's orientation (called polarization) will make either a dark…">LCD</a>. </p>

<p> A few caveats before we get much farther. First, doing this will definitely void your warranty on the display. Second, the display we’ll create is significantly less transparent than a <a href="https://www.crystalfontz.com/product/cfal12856a00151b-128x56-transparent-oled-screen">transparent OLED display</a><a aria-label="  (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.crystalfontz.com/product/cfal12856a00151b-128x56-transparent-oled-screen" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"> </a>as you can see in the above image with the hacked transparent display on the left and the transparent OLED on the right.</p>
<p>If these aren’t deal breakers for you, here’s how to make a DIY transparent display.</p>
