<p>The stars are lighting up again.</p>
<p>“Need a cigarette to make me feel better,” crooned pop star Addison Rae on her 2025 single “Headphones On,” while Lorde sang “this is the best cigarette of my life” in her own 2025 release, “What Was That.” Sabrina Carpenter was recently photographed <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DOHVVgjiRAi/">wearing a corset</a> made of Marlboro Gold packages, and sells shirts with song names emblazoned on mock-ups of cigarette boxes and lighters.</p>
<p>On the silver screen, about half of all movies that made their debut last year included appearances of cigarettes, cigars and other tobacco products, up 10 percentage points from the previous year, according to a new report from public health nonprofit Truth Initiative and research organization NORC at the University of Chicago.</p>
<p>With more actors, pop stars and other celebrities spotted unapologetically smoking, the cultural taboo against it shows signs of ebbing. That worries antismoking advocates, who fear a reversal of the yearslong decline in U.S. smoking rates.</p>
