<p><a data-tag="riley-gaines" href="https://www.sportico.com/t/riley-gaines/">Riley Gaines</a>, the former collegiate swimmer turned right-wing media figure, received $474,313 in compensation last year from the Leadership Institute, according to the conservative organization’s most recent tax filing.</p>
<p>The payout made the 25-year-old Gaines the organization’s highest-paid employee for the year, surpassing its 86-year-old founder and president, Morton Blackwell, by nearly $129,000. The <a data-tag="nonprofit" href="https://www.sportico.com/t/nonprofit/">nonprofit</a>’s second-highest paid employee was John Davis, vice president for growth and development, who earned $409,089.</p>
<p>What stands out most, however, is not the size of Gaines’ compensation package, but how it was structured.</p>
<p>According to the 2024 return, Gaines received just $54,158 in base pay to serve as director of the 501(c)(3) organization’s “Riley Gaines Center,” with a staggering $420,155 (89%) classified as bonus or incentive compensation. By comparison, Davis, as the nonprofit’s chief development officer, received a bonus of a mere $25,131 during the same cycle. Gaines’ incentive compensation was roughly four times larger than any bonus previously disclosed by the Leadership Institute, which no longer appears to have any affiliation with her.</p>
<p>Typically, bonuses in the nonprofit sector are smaller than in the for-profit world. The IRS theoretically scrutinizes federal charities for providing golden parachutes that confer an unreasonable “private benefit.” That said, there are no strict IRS rules governing how large a bonus can be relative to an individual employee’s overall compensation.</p>
<p>Representatives for the Leadership Institute and Gaines did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment from <em>Sportico</em>.</p>
<p>Gaines’ windfall coincided with a banner fundraising year for the Leadership Institute, which Blackwell founded in 1979 to serve as a training ground for conservatives aspiring to top roles in politics, government and the media. Last year, the organization reported a record $49.4 million in contributions and $52 million in total revenue—up from $45 million the year before, when Gaines joined.</p>
<p>The institute officially unveiled the Riley Gaines Center in August 2023, and paid its namesake $126,523 that year. According to a press announcement, the center sought to “advocate for girls, women, and parents at a time when women are under attack, stripped of opportunities to fairly compete in sports, denied access to sex-based scholarships and academic opportunities.” Among its offerings was a free, two-hour Title IX online training course that challenged the Biden administration’s interpretation of and approach to enforcing federal gender equity laws. That effort was echoed in Gaines’ “Speak Louder” campus tour, during which she visited a number of universities last year in her Leadership Institute capacity, promoting her views on trans athletes and <a href="https://secure.leadershipinstitute.org/338c2874-7448-41d5-8472-1d6f85427c83?source_code=EHFAPR2025C2&amp;j=54875&amp;sfmc_sub=11789955&amp;l=1274_HTML&amp;u=520106&amp;mid=546009249&amp;jb=4">soliciting</a> donations for the organization.</p>
<p>Gaines was removed from the organization’s online staff directory in May, according to internet archives, and the webpage for the Riley Gaines Center has also been defunct since that time. Her X <a href="https://x.com/Riley_Gaines_">bio</a> makes no reference to the institute, instead listing her current affiliation with another major conservative organization, Turning Point USA (TPUSA).</p>
<p>This past weekend, Gaines joined the roster of prominent conservative speakers at TPUSA’s AmericaFest Conference.</p>
<p>Upon taking the stage, Gaines acknowledged the enthusiastic ovation from the crowd, stating, “Do you realize who you are giving a standing ovation to and for what? You’re giving a standing ovation to a girl for merely saying that there are two sexes.”</p>
<p>A former All-American swimmer at Kentucky, Gaines rose to national prominence for her opposition to trans athletes participating in women’s sports, a stance shaped by her experience tying for fifth place at the 2022 NCAA swimming championships with Penn swimmer Lia Thomas, who is transgender. In April, the state of Georgia enacted a law, colloquially referred to as the Riley Gaines Act, that bars trans athletes from competing in sports that differ from their biological sex.</p>
<p>In 2024, Gaines and 18 other former college athletes filed a federal lawsuit against the NCAA, alleging that the association’s previous policy allowing trans athletes to compete in certain sports violated Title IX, the equal protection clause, and the plaintiffs’ right to bodily privacy. The lawsuit also named the University of Georgia as a defendant. In September, a U.S. District Court judge <a href="https://www.sportico.com/law/analysis/2025/riley-gaines-lawsuit-transgender-ncaa-court-order-1234872154/">partially dismissed</a> the case but allowed the Title IX claims to proceed.</p>
<p>In the last two years, Gaines has expanded her portfolio of political and sports punditry as a podcast host for Fox News Media’s <em><a data-tag="outkick" href="https://www.sportico.com/t/outkick/">OutKick</a></em>. Last week, Fox News announced it had signed Gaines to a new multiyear deal to relaunch <em>OutKick’s</em> <em>Gaines for Girls</em> and <em>The Riley Gaines Show</em>. (Financial terms of that deal were not disclosed.) Apart from her work for the Leadership Institute, Gaines has become a fixture on the conservative speaking circuit, commanding fees as high as <a href="https://docquery.fec.gov/pdf/080/202507189763647080/202507189763647080.pdf">$25,000</a> per speech.</p>
<p>Last month, Gaines’ pecuniary gains were at the center of an 80-minute <a href="https://www.pablo.show/p/what-is-riley-gaines-hiding">episode</a> of the investigative sports podcast, <em>Pablo Torre Finds Out</em>, which cast her as a profiteer posing as a crusader for women. The episode also highlighted the contrast between Gaines’ outspoken criticism of trans athletes competing in women’s sports and her relative silence on the allegations against her former Kentucky swim coach, Lars Jorgensen, who resigned in 2024 amid widespread sexual misconduct accusations and was declared permanently ineligible by the U.S. Center for SafeSport in October.</p>
<p>Gaines <a href="https://x.com/Riley_Gaines_/status/1991889112744263886?s=20">dismissed</a> the episode as a “hit piece,” mocking what she deemed the investigation’s “ground-breaking discovery” that “I have a job that pays me.”</p>
