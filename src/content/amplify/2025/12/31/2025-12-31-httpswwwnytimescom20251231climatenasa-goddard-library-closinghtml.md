<p><i><p><i>By </i><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/eric-niiler">Eric Niiler</a></p></i></p>
<p>The Trump administration is closing NASA’s largest research library on Friday, a facility that houses tens of thousands of books, documents and journals — many of them not digitized or available anywhere else.</p>
<p>Jacob Richmond, a NASA spokesman, said the agency would review the library holdings over the next 60 days and some material would be stored in a government warehouse while the rest would be tossed away.</p>
<p>“This process is an established method that is used by federal agencies to properly dispose of federally owned property,” Mr. Richmond said.</p>
<p>The shutdown of the library at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., is part of a larger reorganization under the Trump administration that includes the closure of 13 buildings and more than 100 science and engineering laboratories on the 1,270-acre campus by March 2026.</p>
<p>“This is a consolidation not a closure,” said NASA spokeswoman Bethany Stevens. The changes were part of a long-planned reorganization that began before the Trump administration took office, she said.</p>
<p>Goddard is the nation’s premiere spaceflight complex. Its website calls it “the largest organization of scientists, engineers, and technologists who build spacecraft, instruments, and new technology to study Earth, the Sun, our solar system, and the universe.”</p>
<p>Budget cuts, buyouts and early retirements that were part of the administration’s DOGE efforts earlier this year have shrunk the number of both federal workers and private contractors at Goddard to 6,600 from more than 10,000.</p>
<p>The library closure on Friday follows the shutdown of seven other NASA libraries around the country since 2022, and included three libraries this year. As of next week, only three — at the Glenn Research Center in Cleveland, the Ames Research Center in Mountain View, Calif., and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. — will remain open.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/gsfc_master_plan_digest_feb2022_lo_res_website.pdf">2022 master plan</a> called for some consolidation and demolition of facilities at Goddard as well as the construction of new buildings. Ms. Stevens, the NASA spokeswoman, said buildings are being closed because they are outdated or are in an unsafe condition.</p>
<p>Goddard employees, their union and Democratic lawmakers from Maryland have said that the Trump administration sped up the closures in a haphazard manner during the recent federal shutdown, when few people were around the Maryland campus, and that there are no plans for new buildings.</p>
<p>Specialized equipment and electronics designed to test spacecraft have been removed and thrown out, according to a <a href="https://www.gesta-goddard.org/uploads/4/0/5/6/40565251/gestaifptegoddardbuildingclosuresbrief11_14_25.pdf">statement posted on the website</a> of the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Goddard+Engineers%2C+Scientists+and+Technicians+Association&amp;mstk=AUtExfAkLfSOQPQ7_dnUz5on6kpAbC7DR46pqRK3otx6xlAGtlhbXSRUCM6Fc8D7Oqqx_AEwfFHk084J27EMzXFqxzu20MuoqvF7DFu_DzUVa_d38zRaj4g48lSgisVjgg8oLRjnOvNaL1qaHi10230F5Fw7SVRLng0q0n6O83NDI8vcq7s&amp;csui=3&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjQiNXgk-iRAxWmTTABHbGMLywQgK4QegQIARAC">Goddard Engineers, Scientists and Technicians Association</a>, the union that represents Goddard employees.</p>
<p>“The Trump Administration has spent the last year attacking NASA Goddard and its work force and threatening our efforts to explore space, deepen our understanding of Earth, and spur technological advancements that make our economy stronger and nation safer,” said Senator Chris Van Hollen, Democrat of Maryland. “These reports of closures at Goddard are deeply concerning — I will continue to push back on any actions that impact Goddard’s critical mission.”</p>
<p>After Friday, employees who need research help can use a digital “Ask a Librarian” service, or use an inter-library loan service to check out books from other federal-agency libraries, Mr. Richmond said.</p>
<p>Dave Williams, a planetary scientist who left Goddard this year under an early retirement program, said the library was a resource for engineers planning missions to the moon and beyond. Outside researchers not employed at Goddard were also able to use the library and access its holdings.</p>
<p>They included books from Soviet rocket scientists describing missions during the 1960s and 1970s, as well as information about experiments on NASA missions during the heyday of human space exploration.</p>
<p>For more than three decades, Dr. Williams curated information that could be found only at the library and uploaded it to the online archive. By spending hours perusing old articles in The Journal of Spacecraft and Rockets, for example, he was able to understand raw data from experiments on Apollo missions.</p>
<p>“You can’t just get these things online,” said Dr. Williams, the former director of NASA’s Space Science Data Coordinated Archive. Older material hasn’t been converted to a digital format, while many recent scientific and engineering journals and texts are behind a digital paywall and will be harder to access from outside the library, he said.</p>
<p>Among the library’s frequent users has been Santiago Gassó, an atmospheric scientist. When he wanted to learn about chaos theory, he went to the Goddard library, plucked old textbooks and sat down to read. Dr. Gassó, said liked the library’s quiet spaces and floor-to-ceiling windows.</p>
<p>“I get very creative when I go there,” he said. “There’s nothing like going to the bookshelf, picking out a book, and then seeing the one next to it. You start to browse.”</p>

<p>The Space Science Data Coordinated Archive has been offline for several months. With it inaccessible and the library closing, NASA is losing both history and vital information for future space missions, according to Dr. Williams and other scientists.</p>
<p>“It’s not like we’re so much smarter now than we were in the past,” Dr. Williams said. “It’s the same people, and they make the same kind of human errors. If you lose that history, you are going to make the same mistakes again.”</p>
<p>The union representing Goddard employees said researchers have been unable to access online journals that they rely on to do their work.</p>
<p>Building 21 on the Greenbelt campus, which includes the library, a cafeteria and offices, will be closed permanently on Friday. So along with the research material, agency employees are losing a meeting place where engineers, scientists and technicians often gathered to collaborate outside of their labs.</p>
<p>Founded in 1959, the Goddard Space Flight Center has a storied history. The Hubble and James Webb space telescopes were designed and built inside enormous contamination-free “clean rooms” at the Greenbelt campus. Also built there recently was the $4 billion next-generation Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, which is scheduled to launch in 2027, although the Trump administration’s proposed budget would eliminate funding for the project.</p>
<p>Scientists and engineers at Goddard have designed and built probes to explore the sun, an asteroid and the atmosphere of Mars. They have also developed a system of satellites that record changes in the Earth’s atmosphere, ice cover, oceans and land surface — data that is useful for scientific research and disaster response. Future missions taking shape at Goddard include spacecraft to explore Venus and Jupiter’s moon Titan, and a new telescope to search for planets that might hold life in deep space.</p>
<p>In its budget request to Congress in June, the Trump administration proposed slashing NASA’s budget by almost 25 percent, prompting a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/21/science/nasa-formal-dissent-letter-trump.html">public letter of protest</a> signed by several hundred NASA employees. NASA’s science arm, which includes climate and earth science, solar-system missions and astrophysics, would face a cut of 47 percent, to $3.9 billion from $7.3 billion.</p>
<p>Nineteen currently operating science missions, including the Chandra X-ray Observatory, the Juno mission at Jupiter and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/05/climate/trump-climate-satellites.html">the two Orbiting Carbon Observatories</a>, which measure atmospheric distribution of planet-warming carbon dioxide, would be turned off under the plan.</p>
