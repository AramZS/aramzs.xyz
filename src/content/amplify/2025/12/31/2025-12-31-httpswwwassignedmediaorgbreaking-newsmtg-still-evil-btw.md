title: 'Quick Reminder, Marjorie Taylor Greene is Evil'

<div><div data-sqsp-text-block-content="">
<p>by Aly Gibbs</p><p>Marjorie Taylor Greene is a Republican politician, the U.S. representative for Georgia's 14th congressional district since 2021, and an antisemitic fascist conspiracy theorist lunatic. Some folks seem to be forgetting just who she is lately, because she’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/29/magazine/marjorie-taylor-greene-trump-maga-split.html?unlocked_article_code=1.AlA.lW2o.7q-iWAA6xrR7&amp;smid=url-share"><span>walked back some of her crazy</span></a> using the tried and true white woman tears method in an attempt to get out from under the shadow of Donald Trump.</p><p>It ain’t gonna work on me, sister. I’ve got your number. Let’s go over the laundry list together, shall we?</p><p>Greene <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/08/12/901628541/qanon-supporter-who-made-bigoted-videos-wins-ga-primary-likely-heading-to-congre"><span>is a racist</span></a> who believes (or believed) in <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/53498434"><span>the QAnon conspiracy theory</span></a>. She has said that Muslims don’t belong in the American government, September 11th was an inside job, school shootings are staged, Democratic party leaders <a href="https://minndakjcrc.org/news/jcrc-stands-with-georgias-jewish-community-against-antisemitism-and-endorsement-of-political-violence/"><span>should be executed</span></a>, and <a href="https://archive.ph/636tf"><span>Jewish people start forest fires using space lasers</span></a>. She <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-57478728"><span>likened masking and social distancing protocols to the Holocaust</span></a> on the same day that <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-covid-19-deaths-cross-painful-600000-milestone-country-reopens-2021-06-14/"><span>deaths to COVID-19 surpassed 600,000 in the United States</span></a>. She <a href="https://georgiarecorder.com/2022/03/01/marjorie-taylor-greene-spoke-at-an-event-led-by-a-white-nationalist-and-has-no-regrets/"><span>shared a stage</span></a> at AFPAC with <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/resources/extremist-files/nick-fuentes/"><span>white nationalist Nick Fuentes</span></a>, who was a key figure in organizing the January 6th insurrection. She <a href="https://schneider.house.gov/media/press-releases/schneider-colleagues-introduce-resolution-censure-rep-marjorie-taylor-greene"><span>compared Joe Biden to Adolf Hitler</span></a>. She believes <em>they</em> can <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/07/marjorie-taylor-greene-hurricane-helene"><span>control the weather</span></a>, and you know <em>exactly</em> who she meant.</p><p>That’s not everything. I don’t have the time, space or energy to expound upon Marjorie Taylor Greene’s many, many, <em>many</em> sins… but I think it’s important that we remember exactly who she is, even as spineless moderates rush to embrace her as “one of the good ones.”</p><p>Robert Draper’s <em>New York Times</em> piece on Greene’s supposed “break with Trump” is, in a word, laughable. He quotes Greene as saying she was “so naive,” but the obvious truth is that anybody who believes a word Greene says is a rube. She is a professional liar who contorts herself into whatever shape she believes will earn her the most praise and success, and she’s been doing it for years. In an interview with Draper, she says Republicans have been “trained by Donald Trump to never apologize and to never admit when you’re wrong,” but passing the buck to the big orange grease stain is so fucking passé it makes me retch.</p><p>Greene enjoys using her faith not as a shield to protect herself with, but as a foxhole to duck into if you’re even <em>thinking</em> about pointing out that she’s a miserable bigoted bully. She praises opportunistic grifter Erika Kirk as a true Christian for forgiving her husband’s murderer (an act of mercy performed in front of millions chiefly for political clout), and says they are alike in their spiritual goodness. “After Charlie died, I realized that I’m part of this toxic culture. I really started looking at my faith. I wanted to be more like Christ,” she tells Draper.</p><p>Let’s say I’m skeptical.</p><p>Draper trots out defenses of Greene that, in my humble opinion, simply do not hold water when weighed against her mountain of indiscretions over the years. He says she’s broken rank with the Republican party by correctly naming Israel’s war against Palestine a genocide, critiquing Trump’s disastrous tariffs, and by demanding the release of the Epstein investigatory files.</p><p>Well… so fucking what? These aren’t acts of revolution, and Greene has never issued any particularly convincing apologies for her noxious behavior. According to Draper, she still has a sign up in front of her congressional office proclaiming that there are only “TWO genders: MALE &amp; FEMALE.”</p><p>Meanwhile, influential morons are falling all over themselves to <a href="https://archive.ph/RddFo" target="_blank"><span>extend Greene as much grace as they possibly can</span></a>. I have to ask: why? To what end, man? Greene isn’t “pro-democracy,” she’s buddies with one of the Neo Nazis who tried to topple ours just a few years ago. If Greene is part of an “anti-Trump coalition,” it is only because she has a strong enough sense of self-preservation to see the writing on the wall, to understand the truth that people like Trump and Stephen Miller and Pam Bondi refuse to acknowledge:</p><p>This era of scorched earth fascism can’t last, and sooner or later, many of the bit players involved are going to pay a very high price for their participation. Let’s not forget that Marjorie Taylor Greene was and is an agent of this white supremacist Fourth Reich, and should be held to account for it.</p>
