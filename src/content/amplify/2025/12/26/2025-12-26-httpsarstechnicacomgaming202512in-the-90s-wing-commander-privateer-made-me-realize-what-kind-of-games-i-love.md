<p>Most things <em>Privateer</em> did have been done better, but it’s still a classic.</p>

<figure></figure><p>Ever since 1993, I think I’ve unconsciously judged almost every game by how well it can capture how <a data-ml="true" data-ml-id="3" data-orig-url="https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-8984087-15232592?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fwing_commander_privateer" data-xid="fr1766756307965aga" href="https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-8984087-15232592?sid=xid-fr1766756307965aga&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fwing_commander_privateer"><em>Wing Commander: Privateer</em></a> made me feel.</p>
<p>Steam and PlayStation (the two platforms I use the most) have been doing a year-in-review summary akin to the wildly popular Spotify Wrapped for the past few years. Based on these, I can report that my most-played games in 2025 were, from most hours down:</p>
<ol> <li><em>No Man’s Sky</em></li> <li><em>Civilization VII</em></li> <li><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em></li> <li><em>The Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion Remastered</em></li> <li><em>The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria</em></li> <li><em>The Elder Scrolls III Morrowind</em></li> <li><em>World of Warcraft</em></li> <li><em>Meridian 59</em></li> <li><em>Tainted Grail: Fall of Avalon</em></li> <li><em>Unreal Tournament</em></li> </ol>
<p>With the exceptions of <em>Civilization VII</em> and <em>Unreal Tournament</em>, every one of those games is some kind of open-world experience that’s all about immersing you in a far-flung land (or galaxy).</p>
<p>I like what I like, and my knowing that’s what I like began in the early 1990s with <em>Wing Commander: Privateer</em>.</p>
<p><em>Privateer</em> taught me that I love games that are spaces for living out whatever fictional life I create for myself much more than I love games that are guiding me through an authored story and a series of carefully designed challenges.</p>
<p>Yes, it has a story and story missions, but they’re hardly the point, partly because they’re not really that good. What’s exciting about this game is exploring new systems, seeing the beautiful CG artwork for their settlements, learning about your ships’ capabilities and upgrading them slowly over time, and attaining mastery of the pseudo-simulated economy.</p>

<p>The story that matters in <em>Privateer</em> is the story I am telling myself in my head. To this day, the games I most love offer at least a taste of that experience.</p>
<h2><em>Privateer</em>‘s far-reaching (and drama-laden) legacy</h2>
<p>To say this game was influential on later titles would be an understatement, but we, of course, have to acknowledge that this formula was originally popularized by 1984’s <em>Elite.</em> <em>Privateer</em> just married that formula with <em>Wing Commander</em>‘s universe and flight mechanics, with a far more hand-crafted setting. That setting is key, though. I like the original <em>Elite</em>, and this certainly wasn’t the case back in the mid-’80s, but today, it plays like a tech demo for what’s to come.</p>
<p><em>Privateer</em> was the full package. Later, we got the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_(video_game_series)">X series</a>, <em>EVE Online</em>, <em>Elite Dangerous</em>, <em>Starfield</em>, and even <em>No Man’s Sky</em>, a game I love so much I’m literally <a href="https://bossfightbooks.com/">writing the book on it</a>.</p>
<p>None of those games was made by <em>Privateer</em> lead Chris Roberts, of course. He would go on to work on <em>Freelancer</em>, probably the most accessible space trading/pirating game ever made, and an underappreciated gem, even if it didn’t live up to the hype that surrounded it. (Roberts left the project mid-way, and it was finished by others who dropped many of his impossibly ambitious ideas for it.)</p>
<p>Now we have <em>Star Citizen</em>. We here at Ars have covered that game as much as anybody, and it’s fair to say a lot of the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/06/star-citizen-still-hasnt-launched-but-its-already-banning-cheaters/">coverage has not been positive</a>. I won’t retread all that drama here; if you know, you know, and if you don’t, it’s easy to dig up.</p>
<p>But all that is to say that there are few space games today that aren’t directly inspired by <em>Wing Commander: Privateer</em>, and <em>Privateer</em> inspired me too: it inspired me to love sandbox and open-world games.</p>
<figure><p> </p><img alt="A cockpit view in combat" sizes="auto, (max-width: 710px) 100vw, 710px" src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/privateer-combat.jpg" srcset="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/privateer-combat.jpg 710w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/privateer-combat-640x399.jpg 640w"/><p> </p><figcaption>A cockpit view in combat</figcaption></figure>
<p>It’s odd that a game that was so heavily inspired by a title almost a decade its senior (<em>Elite</em>) still managed to be ahead of its time, and maybe that says as much for <em>Elite</em> as it does for <em>Privateer</em></p>
<p><em>Privateer</em> was re-released with Windows support via GOG in 2011, but it took me until recently to revisit it for the first time since the 1990s. Yes, it has ancient graphics now, but they’re endemic to a particular era of PC game graphics that I find extremely nostalgic, so they work for me.</p>
<p>In terms of mechanics and systems, everything <em>Privateer</em> does is done far better and to greater depths by at least one later space game. And to boot, it has more friction and frustrations, and while the game is ultimately pretty easy once you get the hang of it, it’s hard to learn.</p>
<p>But like <em>Freelancer</em> after it, it hits a sweet spot balancing all these aspects that makes it still stand out. <em>Elite Dangerous</em> is the best at the simulation and economy aspects, <em>Star Citizen</em> has more impressively realized ships and settlements, and <em>No Man’s Sky</em> is more accessible while still delivering on the fantasy (and it offers a much wider range of activities).</p>
<p>I don’t know if it’s just nostalgia for that aforementioned 1990s DOS game aesthetic speaking, though, but I’m of the opinion that none of <em>Privateer</em>‘s spiritual successors have matched the character and draw of its setting. Seeing this side of the <em>Wing Commander</em> universe is a treat, and I feel that not even modern games that were entirely about having that same sense of culture and place (like <em>Starfield</em>, for example) don’t quite get there.</p>
<p>I’d be curious how it reads to people who never played it back in the day, though. Like I said, this is a pantheon game for me. If someone who plays <em>Elite Dangerous</em>, <em>Starfield</em>, <em>Star Citizen</em>, or <em>No Man’s Sky</em> today goes back and <a data-ml="true" data-ml-id="6" data-orig-url="https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-8984087-15232592?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fwing_commander_privateer" data-xid="fr1766756307965acc" href="https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-8984087-15232592?sid=xid-fr1766756307965acc&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fwing_commander_privateer">tries <em>Wing Commander: Privateer</em> out</a>, does it hold up for them, too?</p>
<p>If that describes you and you give it a shot, let me know.</p>
