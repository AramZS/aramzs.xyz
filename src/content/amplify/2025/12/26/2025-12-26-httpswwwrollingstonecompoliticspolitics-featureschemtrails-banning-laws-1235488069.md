<p>Banning chemtrails is “like banning unicorns or banning Bigfoot,” says one weather expert</p>
<p>he first week of September, Michael Lewis Arthur Meyer, a self-proclaimed independent journalist and the founder of <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/resources/extremist-files/veterans-patrol/">Veterans on Patrol</a>, which the Southern Poverty Law Center describes as a right-wing militia, appeared at a <a href="https://www.sweetwaternow.com/alt-right-militia-founder-approaches-local-government-officials/">meeting</a> of the Sweetwater County Board of County Commissioners in Wyoming.</p>
<p>Meyer, who is in his late forties with an unkempt reddish bread, wore a safari-style shirt and brimmed hat with sunglasses perched on top. He claimed to be in town to assist with disaster preparedness. But he was not talking about <a data-tag="climate-change" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/climate-change/">climate change</a>. He argued that the people of Wyoming faced an existential crisis due to “<a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/10/30/1126467/weather-control-conspiracy-theory-cloud-seeding-floods/">weather weapons</a>” — a shadowy conspiracy of untested technologies that supposedly alter the Earth’s atmosphere — which, according to Meyer, also caused Hurricane Helene, which had recently devastated western North Carolina.</p>
<p>The “weather weapons,” he warned, came from the U.S. military, which was “playing God with the weather,” spreading dangerous chemicals and other unknown biological materials throughout the atmosphere. These “stratospheric aerosol injections,” commonly called “chemtrails,” came from, he claimed, the <a href="https://www.darpa.mil/about">Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency</a>, or DARPA, a division of the Department of Defense that conducts research. “Our goal here is to set up evacuation routes,” Meyer concluded. “I would ask you guys to take this very seriously because [in Asheville] we have seen the bodies that were put in trailers.… Rescue workers have pulled limbs out of debris piles.”</p>
<p>Wyoming State <a href="https://www.wyoleg.gov/Legislators/2025/H/2143">Representative Marlene Brady</a> was in the back of the room and agreed with Meyer. “I just want to let you know that is 100 percent correct,” she said, referring to the existence of chemtrails and weather weapons. “Our plants are dying, our animals are being affected, we’re being affected.”</p>
<p>When people talk about chemtrails, they’re referring to the white streaks you’ll sometimes see in the sky, which believers think are a dangerous stream of chemicals. To be clear, chemtrails are <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/10/weather/hurricanes-chemtrail-conspiracy-theory-trump">not real</a><a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/11/8/084011">, and banning them,</a> according to Dr. Andrew Dressler, a professor at Texas A&amp;M and the director of the Texas Center for Extreme Weather, is “like banning unicorns or banning Bigfoot.” The trail of clouds behind airplanes in the sky are known as contrails — mere water condensation created by hot exhaust meeting cold air.</p>
<p>Meyer’s group broadcasts conspiracy-laden messages on his Telegram channel, called Sojourner News Network, alongside vague threats to military bases that harbor “weather weapons.” One of his recent projects was nicknamed “<a href="https://sites.google.com/view/operationmorningdew/home">Operation Morning D.E.W.</a>,” with the acronym standing for “Direct Energy Weapons.” At one point, a website, which is now offline, described a “brigade” of “over 3,000 military veterans and civilians” planning an unspecified “counteroffensive against the U.S. military in order to stop chemical agents, biological agents, and directed energy weapons.” The targets include “5G cellular towers,” “<a href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/radar/next-generation-weather-radar">NEXRADS</a>,” which are <a href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/radar/next-generation-weather-radar">Doppler weather radars</a> operated by federal agencies, and “noncommercial aircraft.” The website included a photo of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth with the word “traitor” superimposed. Meyer has accused Hegseth repeatedly of “treason” for the Department of Defense’s involvement in <a href="https://www.war.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/4333326/hegseth-darpa-at-heart-of-americas-strategic-advantage/">DARPA</a>.</p>
<p>While Meyer’s posts often cite a wide panoply of supposed threats — “chemical agents, biological agents, directed energy weapons, bioweapons, nano-tech, and weather weapons” — most of his recent theories have centered around the existence of “chemtrails,” which Meyer believes are poisoning us. When I spoke to Meyer this fall, he described the threat to me very seriously, even angrily. “Are you OK being sprayed like a bug? Are you OK with the military saying we’re going to control the weather? Because that’s not theirs to control. That’s God’s to control.”</p>
<p>Meyer has for years spread QAnon-style conspiracies about secret sex-trafficking rings. In 2018, he claimed that he found a secret pedophile hideout near a cement plant in <a href="https://www.kold.com/story/38322543/veterans-on-patrol-abandoned-camp-tucson/">Tucson, Arizona</a>. While Meyer’s story <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/arizona-veterans-group-finds-homeless-camp-fuels-new-pizzagate-style-n880956">wasn’t true</a>, it generated a flurry of media speculation, and Arizona law enforcement even sent investigators to the site. Meyer was <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/resources/extremist-files/veterans-patrol/">arrested for trespassing</a>. Around the same time, he was also reportedly vandalizing water stations maintained by Humane Borders for immigrants crossing the southern border. <a href="https://www.kold.com/2019/08/06/founder-homeless-veterans-camp-michael-lewis-arthur-meyer-arrested/">He was charged for that, too</a>.</p>
<p>But these ideas about chemtrails no longer live on the fringes of social media. The idea that the skies are poisoning us has gained more traction in recent years, and the mysterious chemicals have been blamed for everything from mind control to weather disasters. In April of this year, Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. appeared onstage with TV personality Dr. Phil McGraw for a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08RfaITutKk">town-hall-style meeting</a> in which Kennedy addressed chemtrails by, like Meyer, blaming DARPA. <a href="https://salatainstitute.harvard.edu/understanding-and-addressing-chemtrails/">At least 30 states</a> — including places as diverse as <a href="https://www.billtrack50.com/billdetail/1771216">Kentucky</a>, <a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/bills/94/2025/0/SF/2462/versions/0/">Minnesota</a>, <a href="https://sdlegislature.gov/Session/Bill/25038/264055">South Dakota</a>, <a href="https://azmirror.com/2025/01/28/chemtrail-believers-sway-gop-lawmakers-to-support-geoengineering-ban/">Arizona</a>, and <a href="https://www.billtrack50.com/billdetail/1823196">Texas</a> — have recently proposed legislation that purports to regulate chemtrails in some way.</p>
<p>In most cases, the bills refer to weather-modification tactics, some of which are in use and some of which are still theoretical. One is <a href="https://www.epa.gov/geoengineering/about-geoengineering">solar geoengineering</a>, also called “solar radiation modification,” a <a href="https://www.ucs.org/resources/what-solar-geoengineering">theoretical </a><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-lede/a-startups-bid-to-dim-the-sun">method</a> to alter the atmosphere by reducing solar radiation through spraying particles in the air that is being <a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/25762/reflecting-sunlight-recommendations-for-solar-geoengineering-research-and-research-governance?ref=compactmag.com">explored by scientists</a> as a way to mitigate the dangers of climate change. (There are also <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-lede/a-startups-bid-to-dim-the-sun">startup</a> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/2025/12/03/stardust-make-sunsets-geoengineering-startups/?utm_campaign=wp_post_most&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;carta-url=https%3A%2F%2Fs2.washingtonpost.com%2Fcar-ln-tr%2F45fd03e%2F693070ee1d64392bc2db2760%2F5972a6319bbc0f1cdce83541%2F23%2F65%2F693070ee1d64392bc2db2760">companies</a> exploring the use of sulfur dioxide, the chemical spewed by volcanoes, to dim the sun, but the method is not currently in use, largely because it is controversial among <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/annals-of-a-warming-planet/dimming-the-sun-to-cool-the-planet-is-a-desperate-idea-yet-were-inching-toward-it">climate scientists</a>.) “<a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/10/30/1126467/weather-control-conspiracy-theory-cloud-seeding-floods/">Cloud seeding,</a>” which involves spraying existing clouds with silver iodide, making them heavier and more likely to produce rain, has also been blamed for chemtrails.</p>
<p>Scientists have experimented with <a href="https://www.dri.edu/making-it-snow/">cloud seeding</a> since the 1960s, when some states began using it in an attempt to increase snowfall, and its <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/10/30/1126467/weather-control-conspiracy-theory-cloud-seeding-floods/">benefits</a> have been relatively modest. But, according to Dessler, cloud seeding does not create weather disasters. “There’s just no way humans can do anything on that scale,” he tells me. “That’s nature.”</p>
<p>Still, the conspiracy has taken hold. After a July 2025 Texas flood killed more than 130 people, most of them children, <a href="https://x.com/search?q=from%3Anaomirwolf%20sky%20&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=top">Naomi Wolf</a>, a prominent conspiracist, posted <a href="https://x.com/naomirwolf/status/1955610813235896800">videos</a> and <a href="https://x.com/naomirwolf/status/1959401673291407705">photos</a> of “chemtrails.” Shortly afterward, a variety of government officials posted on social media about chemtrails, suggesting they were a contributing factor. Lee Zeldin, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, <a href="https://x.com/search?q=from%3Aepaleezeldin%20geoengineering&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=top">posted on July 10</a>, “I tasked my team @EPA to compile everything we know about contrails and geoengineering to release to you now publicly.” The post links to an <a href="https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-releases-new-online-resources-giving-americans-total-transparency-issues">EPA website</a> that quotes Zeldin: “Americans have legitimate questions about contrails and geoengineering, and they deserve straight answers.” The <a href="https://www.epa.gov/regulations-emissions-vehicles-and-engines/Contrails">site</a> might disappoint true conspiracy theorists, however, because it states plainly, “The federal government is not aware of there ever being a contrail intentionally formed over the United States for the purpose of geoengineering or weather modification.”</p>
<p>While most of the proposed laws haven’t passed, <a href="https://www.wyomingpublicmedia.org/natural-resources-energy/2025-10-30/chemtrail-conspiracy-guides-wyoming-geoengineering-legislation">Wyoming</a> is one of the latest states to consider legislation to address chemtrails. In late October, the Joint Agriculture, State and Public Lands and Water Resources Committee of the state Legislature held an eight-hour-long working session to consider a <a href="https://wyoleg.gov/InterimCommittee/2025/05-2025102826LSO-0211v0.5.pdf">bill</a> “prohibiting the release of atmospheric contaminants into the airspace above Wyoming.” A state representative called it the “hottest topic … blocking the geoengineering.” One <a href="https://x.com/cjbakermd">anti-geoengineering expert</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQPVv4DXyjI">testified</a> that the ongoing cloud-seeding operations are on the level of the use of Agent Orange during the Vietnam War.</p>
<p>In late October, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQPVv4DXyjI">Meyers</a> advertised the hearing to his Telegram followers and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQPVv4DXyjI">testified</a> via Zoom about evidence he allegedly had connecting chemtrails to Hurricane Helene.</p>
<p>“This is a global operation,” he said. “These are weapons programs.”</p>
<p>MOST OF THE MAIN PURVEYORS of chemtrail and geoengineering theories reside on the internet, and the people most likely to share photos of benign-looking clouds with a sense of dread are the same ones, according to <a href="https://dash.harvard.edu/entities/publication/6d90834f-9797-4db3-8ed6-63f8599d4e43">research</a>, who likely imbibe other <a data-tag="conspiracy-theories" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/conspiracy-theories/">conspiracy theories</a>, ranging from fears over genetically modified foods to a belief that the Obama administration intentionally attacked a U.S. outpost in <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/new-report-quashes-conspiracies-surrounding-benghazi-attack#:~:text=A%202014%20report%20by%20the%20House%20Intelligence,carried%20out%20the%20attack%20or%20their%20motivations">Benghazi</a>.</p>
<p>Conspiracy theories about chemtrails are becoming more and more common on X, too. A <a href="https://dash.harvard.edu/entities/publication/6d90834f-9797-4db3-8ed6-63f8599d4e43">2016 survey</a> of adults by Dustin Tingley and Gernot Wagner at the Harvard Kennedy School showed 10 percent of respondents thought the chemtrails conspiracy was “completely true” and “a further 20 to 30 percent describe it as ‘somewhat true.’” (The survey did not find links between chemtrail believers and political ideology.) A 2025 study in <em><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02595-5">Communications Earth &amp; Environment</a>,</em> published by science journal <em>Nature,</em> found that around 20 percent of respondents said it was “somewhat or completely true” that weather modification exists. “Beliefs in chemtrails or in ongoing government intervention in the atmosphere are not fringe ideas at this point in time,” the authors wrote, adding that belief in chemtrails was associated with being “younger, female, conservative, religious, and having less education.”</p>
<p>RFK Jr., the conspiracy-driven head of the Health Department, often chimes in on the topic, as well. In August, he posted on X, “<a href="https://x.com/BGatesIsaPyscho/status/1827992555637608614">We are going to stop this crime</a>,” in response to a <a href="https://x.com/BGatesIsaPyscho/status/1827992555637608614">post</a> purporting to be a pilot whistleblower speaking out about chemtrails. (The X account that posted the video, <a href="https://x.com/BGatesIsaPyscho">ConcernedCitizen</a> a.k.a. @BGatesIsaPyscho, describes himself in his bio as “TOP GeoEngineering. Covid was a SCAM. Reject Woke Ideology. No Wars. Conspiracy Realist/Coincidence Analyser” and has 1 million followers. ConcernedCitizen is also the <a href="https://community-notes-leaderboard.com/">number-one website</a> for “community notes” — or corrections for misinformation — on X.)</p>
<p>The theories have spread from social media to legislation. Despite the dearth of scientific evidence, the dozen-plus chemtrail-related bills have received remarkably little pushback, largely riding on the wave of Covid denialism, anti-vaccine sentiment, and so-called health freedom promoted by the Make America Healthy Again movement. Scientists who work in climate science have been somewhat perplexed.</p>
<p>Professor Jeffrey French, who leads the Department of Atmospheric Science at the University of Wyoming, tells me that the conspiracy about weather weapons “has gained a critical mass of people such that it’s being raised in political forums” without much input from people like himself who have been doing work in the field of atmospheric science for years.</p>
<p>In April 2024, <a href="https://wapp.capitol.tn.gov/apps/BillInfo/default.aspx?BillNumber=SB2691&amp;GA=113">Tennessee</a> became the first state to outlaw “the intentional injection, release, or dispersion, by any means, of chemicals, chemical compounds, substances, or apparatus within the borders of this state into the atmosphere with the express purpose of affecting temperature, weather, or the intensity of the sunlight.” Physician <a href="https://www.denisesibleymd.com/press">Dr. Denise Sibley</a>, who is linked to anti-mask and anti-vax movements, <a href="https://wapp.capitol.tn.gov/apps/BillInfo/default.aspx?BillNumber=SB2691&amp;GA=113">testified</a>, “There is no doubt that weather modification is taking place within our state,” and describing it as an “experiment” and a “God-like desire to control the heavens.” In June 2025, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis <a href="https://www.news4jax.com/news/local/2025/06/20/gov-desantis-signs-bill-to-prohibit-activities-intended-to-affect-weather-temperature-sunlight-intensity/">signed</a> a similar bill with criminal penalties — second-degree misdemeanor with fines up to $10,000. (Louisiana’s <a href="https://lailluminator.com/2025/05/19/weather-modification-bills/">yet-unpassed bill</a> would set the fine at a whopping $200,000; <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/national-news/articles/2025-08-07/republicans-eye-bills-to-halt-weather-modification">Pennsylvania</a>, $500,000.) The day he signed the bill, DeSantis <a href="https://x.com/GovRonDeSantis/status/1919843865592484126">posted</a> on X, “The Free State of Florida means freedom from governments or private actors unilaterally applying chemicals or geoengineering to people or public spaces.”</p>
<p>Beyond state legislatures, many U.S. Congress members also tout the conspiracy. After Hurricane Helene in the fall of 2024, Marjorie Taylor Greene <a href="https://thehill.com/video/mtg-says-%e2%80%98yes-%e2%80%98they-control-the-weather%e2%80%99-slams-fema-for-hurricane-helene-response/10108596/">posted</a>, “Yes they control the weather,” on X, followed by a map that suggested the hurricane had been intentionally deployed to ravage Republican-leaning counties. This summer, Greene proposed the <a href="https://standforhealthfreedom.com/actions/hr4403/">Clear Skies Act</a>, a federal ban on weather modification; the legislation would make it a felony to release chemicals into the atmosphere with intent to modify the weather.</p>
<p>THOUGH FEARS ABOUT CHEMTRAILS are surging today, the idea that the U.S. government controls (or tries to control) the weather appears to trace back to at least the 1940s, when the U.S. government collaborated with General Electric to seed clouds with dry ice in a program called “<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190301075951/https://www.alachuacounty.us/Depts/epd/EPAC/General%20Electric%20History%20Of%20Project%20Cirrus%20July%201952%20ORIGINAL.pdf">Project Cirrus</a>.” After a test run, a hurricane swerved west and hit Georgia, with at least one scientist saying he was <a href="https://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hurricane_blog/70th-anniversary-of-the-first-hurricane-seeding-experiment/">“99 percent sure” </a>the change in direction was caused by Project Cirrus. (Scientists <a href="https://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hurricane_blog/70th-anniversary-of-the-first-hurricane-seeding-experiment/">determined later </a>that it probably wasn’t caused by the dry ice, but it did cool the enthusiasm for weather experimentation.) A military plan to increase rainfall as part of the Vietnam war, called “<a href="https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1964-68v28/d274">Operation Popeye</a>,” also spurred additional conspiracy theories about nefarious weather control. Chemtrails, specifically, appear to have originated on a <a href="https://www.netowne.com/">blog</a> that referenced a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-017-0014-3">1996 Air Force</a> paper proposing weather modification, which <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-017-0014-3">fueled theories about links to the military</a>.</p>
<p>Chemtrails began as a more politically neutral theory, much like UFOs. However, over time, the far-right seized on chemtrails as further evidence that the U.S. government was not to be trusted.</p>
<p>One of the main purveyors of the chemtrails theory has been the website <a href="https://geoengineeringwatch.org/">Geoengineering Watch</a>, run by Dane Wigington, a conspiracy theorist who lives off the grid in California. In the early 2010s, Wigington was one of the northern California residents who began to connect the ongoing and historically dire drought with white streaks in the sky. While the number of people who supported the theory was never large, they did make waves in local government.</p>
<p>In July 2014, a local doctor named Dr. Stephen Perlman held <a href="https://krcrtv.com/archive/geoengineering-on-agenda-at-board-of-supervisors-meeting">a three-hour-long meeting</a> in Redding that involved hundreds of residents as well as testimony from scientists, biologists, pilots, physicians, and residents arguing that the streaks were potentially harmful. Perlman’s wife, Melinda, <a href="https://www.siskiyoudaily.com/story/opinion/columns/guest/2015/06/15/guest-opinion-supervisors-should-take/34255237007/">wrote</a> later, “In the fall of 2013, Stephen and I noticed strange white lines in the sky above our apple farm in Scott Valley. They became a daily occurrence, crisscrossing the sky in grid-like patterns.” (Melinda claims chemtrails caused her husband’s cancer; he died in 2015.)</p>
<p>Wigington was the unquestioned star of the 2014 meeting. All five supervisors found “credible and compelling evidence” to substantiate further inquiry; they specifically rejected evidence from federal agencies that had disproven the existence of chemtrails, <a href="https://www.mtshastanews.com/story/news/politics/county/2014/07/23/shasta-county-agrees-to-find/36785545007/">arguing</a> it was “skewed.” In January of this year, the chair of the County Board of Supervisors for Shasta County, Kevin Crye, <a href="https://krcrtv.com/news/local/shasta-county-board-discusses-chemtrails-and-appoints-new-trustee">invited Wigington</a> to reprise his role as scientific educator after three young children in Shasta County were diagnosed with a rare form of cancer.</p>
<p>Wigington’s audience has only continued to grow. In 2023, RFK Jr. hosted Wigington on his podcast in an episode titled “Are Chemtrails Real?” During the conversation, Wigington asserted that chemtrails contain metals like aluminum: “What we’re seeing in our skies are not condensation trails. In almost all cases, they are sprayed particulate trails.” Kennedy expressed alarm. Wigington even appeared on the “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8A6hkS1CUE">Tucker Carlson Show</a>” in November 2025, which got more than a million views. Tucker linked the “total lie” of the Covid vaccine to the chemtrails conspiracy. “So, I know for a fact what you’re describing is possible,” he said to Wigington, whom he treated as an engineering expert. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQPVv4DXyjI">Wigington</a> also testified last month in front of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9E6ebK_Ti0&amp;t=15622s">Wyoming Legislature</a> about chemtrails.) Anonymous online “whistleblowers” have used Wigington’s popularity to catapult their own content, like an interview from <a href="https://mellowkat.substack.com/p/i-finally-confront-the-pilots-who?r=gecv9">an airplane mechanic</a> that purports to prove the existence of chemtrails.</p>
<p>University of California, Berkeley, professor <a href="https://news.berkeley.edu/2025/02/05/why-conspiracies-are-so-popular-and-what-we-can-do-to-stop-them/">Timothy Tangherlini</a>, who studies folklore and conspiracy theories, thinks of the spread of the chemtrails conspiracy as part of a story that gives people both someone to blame and a strategy to cope with the impacts of disastrous weather patterns. Many people, he says, operate in a low-trust environment and are aware of other ways in which the government has covered up harms, such as the use of Agent Orange. “In these low-trust situations, it’s really a fertile ground for this type of story,” he says. “Here, a threat from above that’s probably linked to the government or nefarious deep-state actors in cahoots with chemical companies for unknown reasons … becomes a more palatable narrative than the climate is changing.”</p>
<p>SHORTLY AFTER HURRICANE HELENE DEVASTATED western North Carolina, Meyer arrived to purportedly provide assistance to the many people who were displaced. He initially tried to interfere in a variety of aid operations around Lake Lure and Chimney Rock, two small towns devastated by flooding. In October 2024, Meyer and his Veterans on Patrol group, which mostly consists of acolytes, started hanging around the parking lot of an Ingles grocery chain, which had become a staging place for FEMA. After confrontations with local residents, Ingles managers, with the help of local Lake Lure police, cleared the parking lot. FEMA moved to the nearby public library, and Meyers shifted his operation into the woods nearby.</p>
<p>Meyer then reprised his role by going to Swannanoa, a small working-class town about 40 minutes east of Asheville, where he posted videos of flood-devastated homes and debris floating in the Swannanoa River.</p>
<p>I went to see Meyer in February 2025, eight months after Helene. He was still hanging out in a part of Swannanoa called Good Loop Road, which is a gravel circle that used to be lined with prefab homes and double-wide trailers next to the Swannanoa River. When I went, it hosted more of a squatters’ camp with trailers and a few tents. I found Meyer inside a small trailer; he emerged vaping and talking on the phone.</p>
<p>He immediately began to tell me about the “NEXRAD towers” and how they are poisoning the skies. “I don’t care about the immigration. I don’t care about the border. I don’t care about the government corruption. What I care about is we’re rebuilding people. And if the military can keep doing this, and they can send another weather weapon up here, then what good is rebuilding if we don’t deal with the immediate problem?” he asked.</p>
<p>Meyer was proud to show me around the area, where, he said, he had helped to set up a supply station, clear out some houses, and even build some tiny homes, which were really just a room with a bed. Most of this work had actually been completed by <a href="https://www.samaritanspurse.org/our-ministry/broadcast-occ-ads/?utm_source=Ggl&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=m_YGCW-B25V&amp;utm_content=OCC-lp&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=68852315&amp;gbraid=0AAAAAD2XO8cnH4g5i594ac3QT6ZgCVErH&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAt8bIBhBpEiwAzH1w6SmwfVInPQHp6__8xrSANP4A2WvzCCHwFtOEkllfgTwaXz7o2Ix9BBoCihwQAvD_BwE">Samaritan’s Purse</a>, a nonprofit run by <a href="https://x.com/Franklin_Graham/status/1923528039914234001">Franklin Graham</a>, son of Billy Graham, the evangelical preacher. It was not clear to me what, if anything, Meyer had done.</p>
<p>Meyer pointed to the clouds, which were not clouds in his telling, but chemtrails. “They sprayed us all morning,” he tells me.</p>
<p>He spouted a mixture of commentary, some of it <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/fema-aid-hurricane-helene-income-disparities">moderately accurate</a> about the failure of FEMA to provide sufficient assistance to working-class people in western North Carolina, combined with wild conspiracies about “smart cities” and “weather weapons.”</p>
<p>The place where I met Meyer was the same spot where <a href="https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-during-tour-hurricane-helene-damage-and-exchange-with-reporters-swannanoa-north">Donald Trump</a> gave a post-inauguration speech just a few weeks earlier, in January 2025. Next to the river, which was wider than it had been before the storm, consuming whole feet of property, yellow tape drooped, marking the spot where Trump had given a press conference at which he said that he would consider eliminating FEMA, saying, “And we’ll begin the work of fundamentally changing, terminating, or overhauling FEMA. FEMA has been a disaster, no matter where they are.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/rebuilding-after-hurricane-helene-north-carolina">ProPublica has reported</a> that the poorest residents of Hurricane Helene-impacted regions have gotten the least amount of FEMA funding. (DHS recently said it would release <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/news/2025/11/07/additional-155-million-approved-support-north-carolina-recovery">$155 million</a> for North Carolina’s recovery.)</p>
<p>The people still living around Good Loop Road seemed to accept Meyer as a fixture of the neighborhood, but they were more focused on rebuilding and repairing their own lives. “I don’t pay attention to any politics,” one man told me, waiting for his kid to come home from school. The ground was littered with abandoned car carcasses, sinks from bathrooms, piles of ripped-out insulation.</p>
<p>In the absence of real political action and concern for the residents of western North Carolina, Meyer was there to fill the gap, providing not just imaginary support but also the convenience of a government conspiracy. According to Meyer, once the chemtrails were eliminated, everything would go back to normal. Once the military stops spraying chemtrails, he told me, “watch what happens to nature and how quickly we recover, and how good our rain is, and how people start thinking clearly, and our trees and things will start growing normally.” If only it were that easy.</p>
