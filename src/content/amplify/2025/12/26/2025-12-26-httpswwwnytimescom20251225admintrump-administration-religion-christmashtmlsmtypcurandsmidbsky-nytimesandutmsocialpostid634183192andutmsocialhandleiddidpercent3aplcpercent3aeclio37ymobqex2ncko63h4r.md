<p>The Trump administration celebrated Christmas on Thursday by posting a series of religious messages from official government accounts, using language that drew criticism from those who pointed to the country’s separation of church and state.</p>
<p>While many lawmakers in both parties posted universal messages of love, joy and peace on the holiday, a number of cabinet members and agencies made references to Jesus and the religious meaning of Christmas.</p>
<p>“Today we celebrate the birth of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ,” Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth <a href="https://x.com/SecWar/status/2004182968286564502?s=20">wrote</a>. “May His light bring peace, hope, and joy to you and your families.”</p>
<p>Posts by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, the Homeland Security Department and the Labor Department followed in a similar vein.</p>
<p>“The joyous message of Christmas is the hope of Eternal Life through Christ,” Mr. Rubio <a href="https://x.com/SecRubio/status/2004200932847112594">said</a>.</p>
<p>“Let Earth Receive Her King,” the Labor Department <a href="https://x.com/USDOL/status/2004252941856002185?s=20">said</a>.</p>

<p>Government officials have traditionally steered clear of such overtly religious language, as the Constitution bans an official state religion. The First Amendment’s establishment clause prohibits the government from establishing a religion or favoring one religion over another, while the free exercise clause protects the religious expression of all faiths.</p>
<p>In response to a request for comment, a White House spokeswoman, Anna Kelly, issued a short statement, saying: “Who are the critics? You? And Merry Christmas!”</p>
<p>One of the most extensive Christmas messages was posted by the Homeland Security Department on Christmas Eve. It read, “We are blessed to share a nation and a Savior,” and included a <a href="https://x.com/DHSgov/status/2003862964336759062">video</a> that featured images including the American flag, Christmas trees, Santa Claus, President Trump and a Nativity scene, along with the words “Remember the miracle of Christ’s birth.”</p>
<p>Rachel Laser, the president of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, condemned the message as “divisive and un-American” in a statement to The New York Times on Thursday.</p>
<p>“Our Constitution’s promise of church-state separation has allowed religious diversity — including different denominations of Christianity — to flourish in America,” she said, adding that Americans “should not have to sift through proselytizing messages to access government information.”</p>
<p>The Homeland Security post also drew strong responses online. Alex Nowrasteh, senior vice president for policy at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, <a href="https://x.com/alexnowrasteh/status/2003926193146605856?s=46">said</a>: “Americans don’t share a religion. Our state is secular.”</p>
<p>Timothy Sandefur, the vice president for legal affairs at the conservative Goldwater Institute, <a href="https://x.com/timothysandefur/status/2004254109374063080?s=46&amp;t=8RVfWK6aT7NFt1EvdmY9Mg">said</a>, “Whatever this department of the federal government may say, I appreciate and respect my Jewish fellow Americans.”</p>
<p>Laura Kennedy, a former ambassador who worked in the George W. Bush and Obama administrations, said: “I am a Christian. I am also a proud American because our laws were designed to prohibit a national religion.”</p>
<p>Some conservative Christians and far-right activists celebrated the video. David Millard Haskell, a religion and culture professor at Wilfrid Laurier University in Canada, <a href="https://x.com/DMillardHaskell/status/2004300331413655660">said</a>, “The more Americans embrace this sentiment, the better they will be able to face any threat that comes against them.” Jack Posobiec, a Trump loyalist and friend of the slain conservative activist Charlie Kirk, <a href="https://x.com/JackPosobiec/status/2003880851147509850?s=20">responded</a> to the video: “Yes.”</p>
<p>About 62 percent of Americans identify as Christians, a decline of nine percentage points since 2014, according to the <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/religious-landscape-study/">Pew Research Center</a>.</p>
<p>In the last year, Mr. Trump has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/18/briefing/christianity-in-the-white-house.html">expanded</a> the power and influence of conservative Christians across the government, advancing their political and ideological priorities with a promise to “bring back Christianity.”</p>

<p>In February, Mr. Trump created a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/07/us/politics/trump-anti-christian-bias.html">task force</a> at the Justice Department to “fully prosecute anti-Christian violence and vandalism in our society” and “move heaven and earth to defend the rights of Christians and religious believers nationwide.” The executive order cited the convictions of anti-abortion demonstrators for blocking access to abortion clinics. In May, he established the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/religious-liberty-commission">Religious Liberty Commission</a> in the Justice Department.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump also created a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/18/us/politics/white-house-prayers.html">White House Faith Office</a> led by his longtime personal pastor, Paula White-Cain, and Jennifer Korn, who worked in the first Trump administration. Evangelical leaders say the office, where Ms. White-Cain takes communion every day and displays Bibles, has given them closer access to the president.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the official social media accounts for the Republican Party also leaned into the religious aspects of Christmas, posting <a href="https://x.com/GOP/status/2004190759163941343?s=20">Bible verses</a> and a painting of baby Jesus and the Virgin Mary with a <a href="https://x.com/HouseGOP/status/2004164000565584083?s=20">caption</a> that said, “Today, we remember that Jesus Christ is the reason for the Christmas season.”</p>
