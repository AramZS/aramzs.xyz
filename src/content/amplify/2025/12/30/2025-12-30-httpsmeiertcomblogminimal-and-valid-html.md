<p>If you’re interested in writing HTML that is as compact as possible for a payload as small as possible, and in writing HTML that is error-free and conforms to the HTML standard, then this is a link guide for you. Specializing in minimal and valid HTML, it refers to some of my writings about these subjects.</p>

<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I’m Jens (long: Jens Oliver Meiert), and I’m a web developer, manager, and author. I’ve been working as a technical lead and engineering manager for companies you use every day and companies you’ve never heard of, I’m an occasional contributor to web standards (like HTML, CSS, WCAG), and I write and review books for O’Reilly and Frontend Dogma.</p>
<p>I love trying things, not only in <a href="https://meiert.com/topics/development/">web development</a> and <a href="https://meiert.com/topics/management/">engineering management</a>, but also in other areas like <a href="https://meiert.com/topics/philosophy/">philosophy</a>. Here on meiert.com I share some of my experiences and views. (I value you being critical, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_charity">interpreting charitably</a>, and <a href="https://meiert.com/contact/">giving feedback</a>.)</p>
