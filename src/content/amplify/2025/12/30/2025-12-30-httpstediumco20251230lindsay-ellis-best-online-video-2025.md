  One of the best videos of the year came from someone who once publicly quit
  YouTube. It’s a multi-hour epic—and it’s stuck with me for months.

title: A Complex Case For Empathy
---
<p>Hey all, Ernie here with the first of our year-end Tedium awards. We’ll be giving out three this week, along with our year-end piece. Anyway, here are our picks for best online video of 2025:</p>
<p><strong>Lindsay Ellis has a well-earned distaste</strong> for YouTube, having earned a massive audience over a long period and seeing all the upsides and downsides that come with that. A few years back, she basically quit the platform, emphasizing her writing career instead. She now publishes most of her video content on the paywalled platform <a href="https://nebula.tv/lindsayellis">Nebula</a>.</p>
<p>But she’s also someone who understands that when you have a megaphone, sometimes you must use it.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@msrachel">Ms Rachel</a> was as good a reason as any to pull out the megaphone. The children’s show host has made a compelling case for herself as the perfect children’s entertainer for the streaming era. But the <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/ms-rachel-on-advocating-for-gazas-children-i-wish-leaders-would-hear-their-voices">controversy facing Rachel Accurso</a> for simply advocating for the children of Gaza, put in a difficult situation through no fault of their own, put her in the crosshairs of a cultural storm.</p>

<p>Ellis, alas, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/former-youtuber-lindsay-ellis-says-s-learning-live-trauma-canceled-rcna35389">knows a thing or two</a> about cancellation—she experienced a 2021 tarring and feathering thanks to a controversial tweet that left her open to accusations of casual racism. The concerns didn’t dissipate when she attempted to explain herself—and eventually it took a major toll on her mental health and led to her exit from Twitter.</p>
<p>Her movie-length autopsy of cancellation inspired by the incident, “Mask Off,” is no longer on the video-sharing juggernaut. (That said, you can find it on Nebula or the Internet Archive. Despite Ellis later expressing regret over the video, it nonetheless has its share of fans.)</p>
<p>Soon enough, she left <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/lindsay-ellis-omelas-meaning-vlogger-quits-youtube-raya-controversy-1663563">YouTube</a> entirely, only gradually posting again a few years later. Good thing, because honestly, we needed the Ms Rachel video.</p>

<p>At nearly two and a half hours in length, “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwpanShgOp4">The Unforgivable Sin of Ms Rachel</a>” is nearly an hour longer than any of her previous videos. While it has time for jokes—an extended tradwife satire, in which she preps a meal while breaking down the political conflicts around children’s television, stands out—ultimately it’s the genuinely disturbing subject matter that sticks with you.</p>
<p>This is a video that talks about Mr. Rogers and genocide. Equally.</p>
<p>It highlights conservative attempts to counter-program against educational programming; it discusses the cultural roots of the Israel/Palestine conflict. And it ties it all into reasons why someone like Ms Rachel might become a lightning rod in a culture constantly looking for lightning rods.</p>
<p>The intro specifically references <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2023/04/1135902">the radio broadcasts that led to the 1994 Rwanda massacre</a>, a particularly dark time in human history that does not get discussed enough. It is a parallel to Israel and Gaza that is hard to ignore—and is a significant focus of the back half of Ellis’ video.</p>
<p>But what ultimately stands out more than anything else? Ellis found a way to turn this ugly story, a tale about the awkward space young children fill in complicated, deadly global conflicts, into a successful fundraiser. “Do it for Mr. Rogers,” she wrote near the donation button—which proved a surprisingly effective pitch. As of this writing, Ellis’ video has raised nearly $850,000 for the Palestinian Children’s Relief Fund.</p>
<p>Ellis’ video has many things in common with the past winners of this award. Like <a href="https://tedium.co/2023/12/26/hbomberguy-best-youtube-video-2023/">Hbomberguy</a>, she used a long period of silence to drop a literally massive video essay with a specific target in mind. Like <a href="https://midrange.tedium.co/issues/pat-finnerty-august-is-falling-what-makes-this-song-stink/">Pat Finnerty</a>, she used the format to underline her ambitions. And like <a href="https://tedium.co/2024/12/27/jesse-welles-best-youtube-video-2024/">Jesse Welles</a>, she did not shy away from the politics of the moment.</p>
<p>Empathy is a surprisingly difficult thing to navigate—and Ellis makes a compelling case that it is something worth reflecting on. Another thing worth reflecting on: In her honor, I’ve renamed this category, which started as “Best YouTube Video,” “Best Online Video.” No reason we have to give a giant social network more press.</p>

<p><strong>Can We Save the COMMODORE Brand? My Biggest Project Yet!:</strong> I mean, anyone who actually goes to the trouble of reviving a brand, and succeeds at the task, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN8r4LRcOXc">as Christian “Peri Fractic” Simpson did</a>, very much deserves the nod in a list like this. I mean, he revived the main topic of his channel because he realized it was a legitimate option. Sure, there were a hell of a lot of skeptics about it, but when all is said and done, Peri Fractic managed to revive a dormant brand <em>and</em> ship a working product within about six months. (OK, closer to a year, as <a href="https://tedium.co/2025/06/19/peri-fractic-retro-recipes-commodore-profile/">my profile on him</a> highlighted.)</p>

<p><strong>Algorithms are breaking how we think:</strong> Back in February, Alec Watson of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TechnologyConnections/videos">Technology Connections</a> made a video-length point I feel in my bones. And he started it with this statement: “I should note that this is no doubt going to be the most crotchety, old-man-yells-at-cloud video I’ve ever released, and I won’t hide from that.” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEJpZjg8GuA">The argument</a>? We’ve become so accustomed to algorithms deciding things for us to watch and read that we struggle to actually, functionally do the work to find things ourselves. After dealing with a frequent theme in my social posts of respondents complaining “I don’t understand this” rather than doing 30 seconds of searching on Google, I want to scream it from the rooftops.</p>

<p><strong>Steamed Hams but it’s a Critically Acclaimed Feature Film:</strong> Even when memes have outer limits, someone is always ready to find them. That definitely describes Tyrone Deise’s increasingly bizarre attempts to stretch the limits of “<a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/steamed-hams">Steamed Hams</a>”—a surprisingly reliable Simpsons meme. In the past few years, he has created films inspired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVmw3ZhdzEs">banned Russian propaganda</a>, “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ly1VOlZMF1k">Making a Murderer</a>,” and even the infamously cheap cartoon <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3RhJzWBlcQ"><em>Clutch Cargo</em></a>. But his most ambitious production might be his most recent—an attempt to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk-Oq8iYtVA">turn Steamed Hams into <em>My Dinner With Andre</em></a>, complete with 45 minutes of canonical dialogue. (And yes, there’s a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ecg_5r1L1M">behind the scenes</a>.)</p>
<p>OK, that’s it for our top videos. (<a href="https://tedium.co/2025/12/30/lindsay-ellis-best-online-video-2025/">Here’s the link; please share</a>!) I plan to have a couple more awards this week—keep an eye out for some of my favorite stuff of 2025!</p>
<p>BTW, there’s nothing quite like <a href="https://la-machine.fr/?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=tedium">la machine</a>, a machine that doesn’t fight for your attention like a YouTube video.</p>
