<p>“I’d prefer to remain in the background and just do my thing,” says <a data-tag="roy-lee" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/t/roy-lee/">Roy Lee</a>. “I don’t really want to put a spotlight on myself.” Ironically, these words are being spoken as a photographer literally puts a spotlight on him, posing the mega-producer on a staircase before settling him in his office, where he’s surrounded by dozens of custom Lego cars he built with his son, Leo. The precise snapping of pieces to create a thing of beauty could be a metaphor for how Lee has put together movies during a nearly 25-year career that reached a crescendo in 2025.</p>
<p>Lee, 56, has produced or executive produced 11 films released this year, starting with New Line sci-fi thriller <em>Companion</em> and hitting a high with the almost $1 billion box office gross of Warner Bros.’ <em>The Minecraft Movie.</em> It kept rolling with New Line horror sensation <em>Weapons</em> and the buzz of Lionsgate’s Stephen King feature <em>The Long Walk</em>. And that’s not counting <em>It: Welcome to Derry</em>, the video game feature <em>Until Dawn</em> or the live-action remake of <em>How to Train Your Dragon</em>.</p>
<p>It all has made it undeniably hard for the private and quiet producer to avoid the limelight. Even so, you won’t find him holding court at the Polo Lounge or sitting behind a director giving input on a shot. He prefers a more hands-off approach and wishes studios felt the same way. “Some studio executives think they’re more creative and more talented than the talent they’re working with, whereas I never feel that way as a producer,” Lee says. “I am just trying to get out of the way and help these people get their movie made.”</p>
<p>One filmmaker who appreciates this is <em>Weapons</em>‘ Zach Cregger. “He kicked doors open for me,” says the writer-director, who first worked with Lee on <em>Barbarian</em>, the 2022 movie that established Cregger as a defining voice in horror. “I don’t think anyone has an understanding of the landscape like Roy does. My life changed because of him.”</p>
<p>While he’s made a name for himself with remakes and branded IP such as <em>The Lego Movie</em>, Lee strives to work with original voices, engendering loyalty from a rising class of filmmakers. JT Mollner, who directed S<em>trange Darling</em> and wrote the <em>Long Walk </em>adaptation, notes: “You hear a lot about the nasty people in Hollywood, the sharks. I’ve encountered a few. Roy is one of those rare people who’s had unparalleled success, the type of success that could afford him to be one of those nasty people without consequence. But he chooses to be loyal, honest and supportive to the people he works with.”</p>
<p>Lee got his first taste of success when, as an assistant at 1990s stalwart production company Alphaville Films, he found himself doing an early version of what has become known for: connecting people and material. He created arguably the first online script tracking service in Hollywood, which introduced him to people who would eventually become future power players.</p>
<p>Then, like now, he gets to talent and IP early, and “this is the whole ball game in this business,” notes Warner Bros co-chair Michael De Luca, who found himself in a pitched spec script battle for <em>Weapons</em>, a battle he and his studio eventually won. De Luca, too, notes Lee’s reluctance for bluster.</p>
<p>“He’s got a restrained presence,” he says. “You know what he’s passionate about, but he lets the material and the talent speak for themselves.”</p>
<p>Here, <em>THR</em> Producer of the Year Lee dishes on who said no to what and how a psychic helped him make a key business decision.</p>

<p><strong>What’s your best spec script story? </strong></p>
<p><em>Weapons</em>, where Zach had written the script and multiple places bid on it to the point where his fee, the green light, everything was just worked out perfectly. That was probably the best situation of a script that didn’t exist two months earlier becoming a hit movie two years later.</p>
<p><strong>How fast did he write that?</strong></p>
<p>Around this time three years ago, he was saying that he was going to go away. He was supposed to direct <em>Companion</em>. But he had this idea, and it was just nagging at him. He decided to buckle down and write it. It was Jan. 5 or so when he gave it to me, and I remember we were out to dinner, and it was a very unusual conversation. He was seeing a psychic, and the psychic said, “If you have something to sell, don’t sell it till this date.” And I’m like, “OK, well, let’s just go out with that date.” And that was the date. Then it ended up selling for a huge amount of money. And so, we’re not saying that there’s any credence to the psychic, but it was pretty funny that we were just basing it all on that.</p>
<p><strong>Zach credits you with the idea of sending it out via a special script software. </strong></p>
<p>We used Embershot. You could see how fast they’re reading and who’s actually reading it. And, in fact, you can’t pass it along to someone else. So we’re just like, oh, let’s just try Ember Shot. So it made it more of an event.</p>
<p><strong>Mike De Luca said he wanted to do it within two hours. Was</strong><strong> that the fastest yes you’ve ever got? </strong></p>
<p>Definitely. And that played a lot into why Zach ultimately picked Warner Bros. Because there are many other places that said yes. Except Skydance. That was the only place that passed.</p>
<p><strong>Warners had no idea that they’d be mounting an Oscar campaign for Amy Madigan until opening weekend, when people started talking about Aunt Gladys. Did you think that she was going to be a breakout character?</strong></p>
<p>Not to the extent that it [happened]. I knew that people would be surprised when they saw her appear more than halfway through the movie, where there were only little snippets of her in the background. So it was actually surprising how much people loved the character and were dressing up as her during Halloween. It was like its own Pennywise, but a female new horror creation.</p>
<p><strong>Do you care about awards? </strong></p>
<p>Personally, I don’t, but I’m happy for other people to get them. I’m not out there trying to get awards. In fact, I’d prefer just to remain in the background and just do my thing. I don’t really want to put a spotlight on myself.</p>
<p><strong>How does one convince Stephen King to option one of his stories?</strong></p>
<p>He was extremely happy with the way that we took <em>It</em> and made the children’s story a stand-alone [movie]. He was like, “Who came up with that?” I was like, “Oh, I thought it’d be a much more enriching experience just to see the kid’s story on its own without having to jump back and forth.” And he’s like, “That was such a great idea.” After learning that I was the one who thought of that idea, he said, “Anytime you want anything to develop that becomes available, you can have the first right.” And so when<em> Long Walk</em> became available, I called. From the time I got the rights to wrapping production, it was 18 months.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your takeaway from </strong><strong><em>The Long Walk</em></strong><strong>? Because it didn’t exactly …</strong></p>
<p>It made $65 million on a $20 million budget, so it didn’t lose money. It didn’t blow up, but I feel like it’s going to be similar to the way that <em>Shawshank Redemption</em> is considered now. <em>The Long Walk</em> is, in a decade or so, going to be considered a classic.</p>
<p><strong><em>Minecraft</em></strong><strong> famously took a long time to get to the screen. Why?</strong></p>
<p>Toby Emmerich shut it down when he first started, and if he had never run Warner Bros., it would’ve been made years earlier. It was only after Pam [Abdy] and Mike [De Luca] started that they reignited the project and it got made, but he was the obstacle for sure. Same way, he was the obstacle of <em>Five Nights at Freddy’s</em> getting made because I had set up <em>Five Nights at Freddy’s</em> and <em>Minecraft</em> at Warner Bros. Gil Kenan was ready to [direct]. He wrote the script and they let it go.</p>
<p><strong>Will the </strong><strong><em>Minecraft</em></strong><strong> sequel be getting a bigger budget this time? </strong></p>
<p>It shouldn’t be that much more expensive other than raises for some talent. The first movie had more than 10 years of development. Those costs were really high. At least $10 million. When Toby was there, I could have moved it, but nobody else would have paid the costs.</p>

<p><strong>Is there a winner in the fight over Warner Bros., especially for creatives and producers?</strong></p>
<p>If Pam and Mike are still running Warner Bros. after the fight to own the studio, then it’s a win for creatives and producers who will be able to keep making movies for them.</p>
<p><strong>Let’s go back to your origin story. You were born in Brooklyn, and your Korean mom wanted you to be a pastor. You ended up doing law in D.C. for a year. What did you learn about yourself?</strong></p>
<p>I was seeing some of the people who had been there for more than 10 years — they lived and breathed law. They read case law, they talked about it on the weekends. I never saw myself being that way. And so I was just like, “This is not for me.” I wanted to go have fun on the weekends. I wanted to watch movies, listen to music, and I just wanted to do something that I felt like I would want to live full time in.</p>
<p><strong>You moved to L.A. and started a tracking system that all the up- and-coming execs use to know what’s being set up around town. </strong></p>
<p>It allowed me to meet the 650 people who [used the service and] and were young and rising within the Hollywood system. So they all knew me, they all had to call me, and they also enabled me to see all the data of other people, because the amount of time savings was worth it to these people to give up some degree of confidentiality.</p>
<p><strong>Your first producing credit came on the 2002 remake of </strong><strong><em>The Ring</em></strong><strong>. How did that happen? </strong></p>
<p>I was watching the VHS cassette of the [original 1998 Japanese] movie and had not seen it before. I was living by myself, and it was too scary for me. After the second big scare, I turned it off and called [DreamWorks executive] Mark [Sourian] and asked if he wanted to watch the movie. And so I went over to his place and we watched it together, and it scared the crap out of both of us. And that next day, he went to [DreamWorks heads] Walter [F. Parkes] and Laurie [MacDonald]. They watched it and they said, “Yeah, do it.” And within a week, we bought the rights.</p>
<p><strong>And so that set up your career that basically made you the Asian horror remake guy?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah. I contacted the producer of the original, and I was like, “What else do you have?” He sent me a VHS of<em> The Grudge</em>. Within a year, that was also into production. I’d seen the conversion rate of development to production at studios was about 2 to 3 percent, meaning that of a hundred projects that are set up for development, maybe two or three actually get made. So I was like, “I’m going to set up 24 Asian remakes, one a month for the next two years, and just hope to get a few of those made.”</p>
<p><strong>And how many of them got made? </strong></p>
<p>Eighteen.</p>
<p><strong>Holy cow.</strong></p>
<p>That allowed me to meet different writers, different studio executives. It allowed me to just see the process of putting movies together and getting them made.</p>
<p><strong>What’s the title or IP that you have yet to land but want? </strong></p>
<p><em>Calvin and Hobbes</em>. I’ve been chasing that for years and years, and I just have gotten nowhere with [creator] Bill Watterson. I began writing letters to him over 20 years ago. He lives in Chagrin Falls, Ohio, and I was actually contemplating just going out there and just staying at a local Best Western and seeing if he ever shows up at the [local] bookstore. All he does is these wood carvings for poetry readings, and every now and then he goes to the bookstore and does signings.</p>
<p><strong>What are the big lessons you learned over time in Hollywood? </strong></p>
<p>It’s just two things: good taste and good judgment. As a producer, if you have good taste and you know what ideas to pick that are going to be commercial successes or creative successes — and if you have the good judgment to be able to know where to put it and who to talk to and just handle everything to make it come to fruition, that’s 90 percent of what a great producer does. A lot of times somebody has great taste, but their judgment is wholly off, or their judgment is great, but they just have terrible taste. And I think I have great taste and great judgment.</p>
<p><strong>So, if young Roy Lee came into Hollywood in 2025, how would you do it? </strong></p>
<p>I would look for areas that will be the next wave of possible source material for movies that could be mined. I would monitor the landscape, and it would most likely be something AI-related — someone out there utilizing AI to create short films or proof of concepts or fake trailers or just something that can be taken and created and expanded in order to reach a mass audience.</p>
<p><strong>But would a young Roy Lee even want to come to Hollywood in 2025? </strong></p>
<p>Yeah. Because it always was going to be entertainment. I was just wanting to be involved with the creation of that entertainment, be it music, film or TV.</p>
<p><strong>Because the big refrain today is “What’s the point of Hollywood? It’s all tech. It’s a bad time. The studio system’s dead.”</strong></p>
<p>That’s probably for people who are in it just for the commerce part of it, as opposed to creating something unique and interesting for people to watch. I think about this whenever I develop anything: I want to make something that will be somebody’s favorite movie of all time. Making money is secondary to just making something super great. The fact that this year I was able to do <em>Weapons</em> and <em>The Long Walk</em>, two totally different style-of-creation movies, that’s great. And I’ve had more people tell me they loved <em>The Long Walk</em> than any other movie I’ve done.</p>
