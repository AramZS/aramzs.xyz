<p>Over the weekend, Covid-cautious individuals shared clips on social media of Jon Stewart punching down on people who are masking, who are presumably doing so to protect themselves from Covid, the flu, and other infectious diseases that are spreading across the United States.</p>
<p>On the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKxp4Z0HOBg">December 11 episode</a> of the podcast <em>The Weekly Show With Jon Stewart</em>, guest Tim Miller of <em>The Bulwark</em> said there have to be at least two people at fellow guest Jon Favreau’s workplace wearing masks because it’s a progressive organization. Stewart responded, “There’s always two, and you always say, ‘Oh, are you sick?’ And they go, ‘Uh, I don’t want to talk about it.'”</p>

I do it for my medically fragile daughter (Batten Disease). People not masking properly led to her getting pneumonia, which led to her being on life support, which led to me getting price quotes on her cremation just in case.<br/><br/><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:7l5ynnu7hxrinmenpmw5sz3k/post/3mb3vl7ycw22g?ref_src=embed">[image or embed]</a></p></blockquote>
<p>First of all, asking people why they are masking is invasive behavior. No one randomly owes you information about their health, their loved one’s health, or, understandably, just wanting to avoid Covid, which is the only way to prevent Long Covid. As I’ve also <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2024/08/long-island-mask-ban-class-action-disability-lawsuit/">previously reported</a>, disabled people in New York’s Nassau County have reported being harassed after the county passed a mask ban. Cancer patients have also told their stories of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_vQynGCJQ4">being questioned</a> about why they’re masking. Even before the start of the Covid pandemic, populations including cancer patients and organ transplant recipients have been encouraged to mask by healthcare professionals.</p>
<p>“Sad that Jon Stewart and friends have become just more white liberals who enjoy punching down at marginalized people who are just doing our best to survive,” Karistina Lafae, a disabled author and essayist, told me. “Those of us who have Long COVID, who have watched family and friends die of COVID, we are being mocked for taking common-sense precautions against illness and further disability.”</p>
<p>Research also shows that Long Covid is very much a working-class problem. A <a href="https://oem.bmj.com/content/82/Suppl_2/A58.3">study looking </a>at people in Spain found that workers who had close contact with colleagues at their job, did not mask, and took public transit to and from work are more likely to have Long Covid, thus also highlighting Covid as an occupational problem. The United States Census Bureau <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2023/05/long-covid-19-symptoms-reported.html">also reported</a> in 2023 that Black and Latino adults were more likely to report experiencing Long Covid symptoms than white people.</p>
<p>Some people have also pointed out the hypocrisy of <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/07/jon-stewart-9-11-first-responders-bill-passed?srsltid=AfmBOoqTX9uFENo9uvqo9LTtHxY1Nt2gnLDKZ3wgEoY2kluik_pGjJrC">his work supporting</a> 9/11 first responders and how he is talking about masking now. Epidemiologist Gabrielle A. Perry posted on BlueSky that Stewart has “some absolute fucking NERVE to be making fun of Long COVID survivors and people still masking” when “he’s seen UP CLOSE the government deny healthcare and resources for 9/11 survivors who breathed in toxic air and are suffering decades later.”</p>

<p><a href="https://www.motherjones.com/criminal-justice/2023/08/baltimore-police-violence-media-freddie-gray/">Justine Barron</a> worked a few blocks from the World Trade Center in 2001. “On top of exposure that day, I was exposed for a year and developed extremely severe breathing and skin issues, as well as immune dysfunction,” Barron told me. Barron acquired Long Covid in 2020, and her doctors believe that her 9/11-related conditions made her more susceptible to developing Long Covid.</p>
<p>Barron is part of a 25-year World Trade Center Health Commission study, including hundreds of thousands of participants. “More recently, there have been questions related to Covid and Long Covid indicating that the commission is also aware of this connection,” Barron said. “My point is that you can’t be supportive of the 9/11 responders without also being supportive of Long Covid. Both environmental harms cause similar issues in people, and there are many of us that are double victims.”</p>
