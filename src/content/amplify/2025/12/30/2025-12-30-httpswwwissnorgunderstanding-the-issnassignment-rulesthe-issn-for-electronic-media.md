title: The ISSN for electronic media
---
<h1>The ISSN for electronic media</h1>
<p>An ISSN can be assigned to all electronic resources: CD-Roms, DVDs, websites, etc. Depending on their types, these resources must meet specific criteria.</p>
<ul> <li>Electronic publications: online newspapers, CD-Roms, DVDs, etc.</li> <li>“Ongoing integrating resources”: websites, databases, wikis, etc.</li> <li>How should an ISSN be displayed on electronic publications?</li> <li>Applying for an ISSN for an electronic publication</li> </ul>
<h2>Electronic publications: online newspapers, CD-Roms, DVDs, etc.</h2>
<p>If and when your electronic publication satisfies the definition of a serial publication, it can be identified by an ISSN, irrespective of its physical medium.</p>
<p>If your electronic publication is a version of an existing printed publication, it must have its own ISSN, even if the title is identical.</p>
<p>The same ISSN must be used irrespective of the formats your publication is distributed in (HTML, PDF, etc.).</p>
<p>If your print publication includes a CD-Rom version, it is a “multi-media” publication: only one ISSN is assigned.</p>
<h2>“Ongoing integrating resources” : websites, databases, wikis, etc.</h2>
<p>As an “ongoing integrating resource,” your website, database, wiki or blog can have an ISSN, under certain conditions.</p>
<h3>To be identified by an ISSN, your ongoing integrating resource must:</h3>
<ul> <li>present editorial content (written text),</li> <li>mention the editorial responsibility, comprised generally of more than one person (name of the editor or publisher) and, as a minimum, the country of publication,</li> <li>have a title that can be easily identified and doesn’t change when updated,</li> <li>have a valid URL address,</li> <li>cover a precise subject or address a specific target audience.</li> </ul>
<h3>Your ongoing integrating resource cannot obtain an ISSN if:</h3>
<ul> <li>it contains personal content: personal website, online personal diary, etc.</li> <li>it constitutes a short-lived resource, whose end is determined from its conception</li> <li>it is focused on a company, product, institution or organisation: <ul> <li>advertising, commercial or promotional website,</li> <li>information site for one or more products,</li> <li>corporate / institutional and community website.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>
<p>If your ongoing integrating resource is of an exclusively local interest, it will not be identified systematically by an ISSN: consult with your <a href="https://www.issn.org/en/the-centre-and-the-network/members-countries/the-issn-network-today/">ISSN National Centre</a>, which will determine whether an ISSN should be assigned to it.</p>
<h2>How should an ISSN be displayed on electronic publications?</h2>
<h3>Online publications (websites, blogs, wikis, databases, etc.)</h3>
<p>The ISSN should be shown on the homepage or, failing that, on the main menu.</p>
<h3>Physical media (CD-Roms, DVDs, microfiches, etc.):</h3>
<p>The ISSN should be shown on any label that is attached permanently to the publication.<br/>
 If this is impossible, it should be displayed on the box or case.</p>
<h3>Multiple ISSN</h3>
<p>If you publish the same publication on different media (e.g.; print version and CD-Rom version), you can show their respective ISSN on each version, by mentioning the additional items of information that can be used to distinguish them.</p>
<p>For example:<br/>
 ISSN 1562-6865 (Online)<br/>
 ISSN 1063-7710 (Print)</p>
<p>or:</p>
<p>Online publication: ISSN 1562-6865<br/>
 Print publication: ISSN 1063-7710</p>
<h2>Applying for an ISSN for an electronic publication</h2>
<p>The procedures for applying for an ISSN are the same for all publications (refer to <a href="https://www.issn.org/understanding-the-issn/assignment-rules/issn-the-major-principles/">the details</a>).</p>
<p>The required supporting documents may vary according to the medium.</p>
<p>As for a print publication or a publication on CD-Rom, you can apply for an ISSN <strong>up to 3 months before a publication is released</strong>, if the information and documents you provide demonstrate that the project is sufficiently advanced.</p>
<p>Please note that <strong>online ressources are usually not ISSN assigned ahead of publication</strong>.</p>
<p>The assigned ISSN is only duly registered in the <a href="https://www.issn.org/understanding-the-issn/the-issn-international-register/">ISSN International Portal</a> once the first issue is received.</p>
<p><strong>The ISSN in the digital age</strong><br/>
 With the development of the Internet and digital technologies, ISSN are assigned to CD-Roms, DVDs, online newspapers, websites, databases, etc.<br/>
 Not only do they identify electronic publications, they also make it easier to access them via the URLs registered in the ISSN records.<br/>
 Furthermore, bibliographic links such as “publication(s) on other media” are used to verify immediately whether the electronic publications are published on other media (e.g.; print).<br/>
<strong>Serial publication – definition</strong><br/>
 A serial publication is an unfinished set of documents, published successively under the same title, for an undetermined period of time.<br/>
 The standard ISO 3297 defines it as a publication, in any medium, issued in successive parts, usually having numerical or chronological designations and intended to be continued with no predetermined end.<br/>
<strong>What is an ongoing integrating resource?</strong><br/>
 An ongoing integrating resource is a non-fixed resource: it can be updated at any time by adding information or by replacing obsolete information with new information.<br/>
 It is defined by ISO 3297-2007 as a continuing resource that is completed by updates integrated into the body of the work.<br/>
<strong>Did you know?</strong><br/>
 In December 2018, approximately 267,000 electronic publications (including 247,000 online) were identified in the <a href="https://www.issn.org/en/understanding-the-issn/le-registre-internat-en/">ISSN International Portal</a>.</p>
