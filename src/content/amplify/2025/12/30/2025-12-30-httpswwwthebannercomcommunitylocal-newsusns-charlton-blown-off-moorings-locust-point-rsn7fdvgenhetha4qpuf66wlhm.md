<h3>The ship was brought under control, and tugs were standing by to help</h3>
<p>Gale force winds blew a 950-foot military cargo ship off its moorings in South Baltimore on Monday afternoon.</p>
<p>Bystander photos show the big ship blown off the shore with its ramp collapsed into the water.</p>
<p>Tugboats were dispatched around 3 p.m. after the 62,000-ton USNS Charlton became unmoored in Locust Point, said Mike Reagoso of McAllister Towing. He said the ship is under control and tugs are standing by to help.</p>
<p>The USNS Charlton and another ship, the USNS Pomeroy, were berthed at a pier leased by the Maritime Administration while the ships were being transferred to the agency. The Pomeroy was moved in September to a berth at Norfolk Naval Station in southeastern Virginia.</p>
<p>The ships had previously been part of the Military Sealift Command’s prepositioned fleet, berthed in the Indian Ocean and loaded with Army equipment to be delivered on a moment’s notice.</p>
<p>Locust Point neighbors have <a href="https://www.thebanner.com/community/local-news/locust-point-military-ship-pomeroy-YB6J4WYWCNDPVLXTFVILD47O34/">complained for months about loud noise and fumes coming from the ships’ diesel generators.</a> The ships arrived at a pier near the Silo Point condominium and the former Under Armour headquarters last spring.</p>
<p>The National Weather Service issued a gale warning for the area through Monday night, meaning winds from 34 knots to 47 knots. Meteorologists are warning of a chance for wind damage and power outage.</p>

<p>Heavy winds battered the neighborhood Monday evening. Residents bundled in hats and coats took their evening walk with pets and kids in strollers in spite of it.</p>
<p>Word quickly spread of the ships’ unmooring earlier in the day among neighbors who’ve found its noise to be a nuisance.</p>
<p>Timothy Doran, an eight-year Silo Point resident who’s chairing a committee to get the ships out of the neighborhood, hopes this incident helps their cause. “It shows that this is not the right place for a ship,” Doran said.</p>
<p>All crew members aboard the Cornelius H. Charlton are accounted for, a spokesperson for the Maritime Administration said in an email. Additionally, personnel are working to recover the portable vehicle ramp attached to the ship’s side port that fell into the water.</p>
<p>“We are grateful to our partners in Baltimore for their swift response in securing the ship,” the spokesperson said.</p>
