title: A small collection of text-only websites

<p>A couple of years ago, I started <a href="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2024/05/link-relalternate-typetext-plain/">serving my blog posts as plain text</a>. Add <code>.txt</code> to the end of any URl and get a deliciously lo-fi, UTF-8, mono[chrome|space] alternative.</p>
<p>Here's this post in plain text - <a href="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2025/12/a-small-collection-of-text-only-websites.txt">https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2025/12/a-small-collection-of-text-only-websites.txt</a></p>
<p>Obviously a webpage without links is like a fish without a bicycle, but the joy of the web is that there are no gatekeepers. People can try new concepts and, if enough people join in, it becomes normal. I'm not saying the plain-text is the <em>best</em> web experience. But it is <em>an</em> experience. Perfect if you like your browsing fast, simple, and readable. There are no cookie banners, pop-ups, permission prompts, autoplaying videos, or garish colour schemes.</p>
<p>I'm certainly not the first person to do this, so I thought it might be fun to gather a list of websites which you browse in text-only mode. If you know of any more - including your own site - please drop a comment in the box!</p>
<ul> <li> <a href="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2024/05/link-relalternate-typetext-plain/">Terence Eden's blog</a> - add <code>.txt</code> to any URl. </li> <li> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/10/apple_uk_lawsuit_app_store_commissions.text">Daring Fireball</a> - add <code>.text</code> to any URl. </li> <li> <a href="https://flower.codes/2025/10/23/onion-mirror.txt">Zach Flowers</a> - replace <code>.html</code> with <code>.txt</code>. </li> <li> <a href="https://fabien.benetou.fr/Content/SwappingPartsOfTheRestrictionStack?action=source">Fabien Benetou's PIM</a> - add <code>?action=source</code> to any URl. </li> <li> <a href="https://m0yng.uk/2025/03/Tracking-the-benefits-of-Solar-and-Battery.txt">M0YNG</a> - add <code>.txt</code> to any URl. </li> <li> <a href="https://gwern.net/speedrunning.md">Gwern</a> - add <code>.md</code> to any URl or send an HTTP Accept for Markdown. </li> <li> <a href="https://nooshu.com/feed/feed.txt">Matt Hobbs</a> - there is a <em>feed</em> of plaintext which allows you to read recent posts. </li> </ul>
<p>If you'd like to add a site, please get in touch. The rules are simple - content which has the MIME type of <code>text/plain</code>. No HTML, no multimedia, no RTF, no XML, no ANSI colour escape sequences.</p>
<p>Emoji are fine though; emoji are cool.</p>
