  ‘The Precedent Is Flint’: How Oregon’s Data Center Boom Is Supercharging a
  Water Crisis
---
<p> I n the spring of 2022, Jim Doherty kept having the same conversation with folks at the only grocery store in Boardman, his eastern <a data-tag="oregon" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/oregon/">Oregon</a> hometown, or at the grain depot where he picked up food for his four ranch dogs. Healthy adults that these people knew were coming down with unexplained medical conditions, including diseases and cancers that usually afflicted the elderly. “It was kinda grim,” Doherty says.</p>
<p>Sixty years old, broad-chested, with a salt-and-pepper goatee, Doherty had been running a cattle ranch business with his wife for 25 years when he entered public service in 2016, winning a seat on Morrow County’s three-person board of commissioners.</p>
<p>What stood out about those conversations was the way people connected them to a problem with water in the area. Doherty knew what they meant: The county’s underground water supply had been tainted with nitrates — a byproduct of chemical fertilizers used by the megafarms and food processing plants where most of his constituents worked.</p>
<p>The aquifer underneath Morrow County, known as the Lower Umatilla Basin, is the only source of water for as many as 45,000 residents in and around the county, the majority of whom rely on private wells that draw on the basin. Since 1991, regulators at the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) have been collecting samples from the aquifer that show a slow and steady increase of chemical toxins in the water.</p>
<p>Water hadn’t really been a political priority for Doherty — he’s a Republican, and he focused mostly on economic development and transportation projects — until a couple of years into his second term, when the uptick of stories he heard about young women enduring miscarriages and middle-aged men with organ failure started making him uneasy. Scientists believe that excess consumption of even a small amount of nitrates can do significant harm to the human body; they can cause debilitating conditions in newborns and have been linked to increased risks of cancer. Doherty wasn’t familiar with the research at the time, but he wondered if there was a connection between the contamination in the water and those conversations he kept having.</p>
<h2> Editor’s picks </h2>
<p>In June 2022, he decided to do something about it. He went out and collected tap water samples from six homes he chose at random and sent them to a nearby laboratory. The lab called a few days later and explained that it was their policy to notify anyone with a sample that tested above the federal limit for the presence of nitrates in drinking water — 10 parts per million.</p>
<p>Doherty asked which family was going to receive the bad news about their water. But the lab tech corrected him. It wasn’t one of the homes he visited that had a toxic well. It was all six. Doherty says he picked up 70 more test kits and went back out a week later, this time knocking on doors across a wider swath of the county. The results were equally bleak. Of the 70 wells he tested, 68 violated the safety threshold, with an average concentration of nitrates close to four times the federal limit.</p>
<p>When Doherty collected the water samples, accompanied by an official with the county health office, they’d taken an informal survey. Talking mostly to farmhands and factory workers who were reliant on well water, they asked if anyone in their household had one or more of the known medical conditions linked to nitrate exposure. According to Doherty, within the first 30 homes they visited, they heard of at least 25 miscarriages and a half dozen people living with one kidney. “One man about 60 years old had his voice box taken out because of a cancer that only smokers get,” Doherty says, “but that guy hadn’t smoked a day of his life.”</p>

<p>It never occurred to Doherty that his effort to fix the water problem would provoke the ire of a group of local officials who resented scrutiny of their role in the pollution. That it would end his political career, tank his cattle sales, and cause him so much stress he’d lose 50 pounds. He couldn’t have foreseen the multibillion-dollar political scandal submerged in that fouled water, the class action lawsuit that would rise from it, the intervention by the Oregon governor and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, a civil suit from the Oregon attorney general, or sanctions from the state’s ethics commission and Department of Environmental Quality. He never thought parents in the area would be terrified that their children might sneak a glass of poisonous water from the kitchen sink. And he never imagined that one of the world’s largest tech companies — <a data-tag="amazon" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/amazon/">Amazon</a> — could play a part in the crisis.</p>
<p>“The historical precedent here is Flint, Michigan,” says Kristin Ostrom, executive director of Oregon Rural Action (ORA), a water rights advocacy group. “In part because of how slow the response to the crisis has been, and in part because of who’s affected. These are people who have no political or economic power, and very little knowledge of the risk.”</p>
<p>AMAZON OPENED MORROW COUNTY’S first “hyperscale” <a data-tag="data" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/data/">data</a> center in 2011 — nearly 10,000 square feet of warehouse space filled with rows of computer servers. The facility services the company’s most profitable division, its cloud computing platform Amazon Web Services (AWS). Amazon’s presence lent Big Tech cachet to the county’s industrial district and diversified its investment portfolio away from a reliance on agriculture. Amazon has generated commercial taxes for the county worth more than $100 million over the course of a decade.</p>
<p>Eager to compete with other rural communities looking to host data center campuses, local officials had offered Amazon a 15-year tax abatement for each hyperscale data center it built, which would be worth billions to the company. Amazon has since constructed seven such facilities in the area, with agreements for five more underway.</p>

<p>There was good reason for Amazon to set itself up in a place like Morrow County. With $107 billion in cloud computing sales in 2024, Amazon Web Services has the dominant position with 30 percent of the market. But the company faces stiff competition from Microsoft, Meta, Oracle, and Google. In the third quarter of 2024, Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft increased their investment in data centers 81 percent compared to the previous year, per the telecom market researcher Dell’Oro Group, and have already spent $360 billion on capital expenditures over the past 12 months. S&amp;P predicts that demand for new construction is expected to double by 2030, most of it in rural counties like Morrow that are otherwise reliant on agriculture. Around the country, and the world, there is a land race among the big tech companies for sites for their data centers. The stakes of the game are high: A<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/don-t-fear-ai-bubble-105043701.html"> recent Goldman Sachs analysis </a>found AI technology could unlock as much as $5 trillion to $19 trillion for the American economy.</p>
<p>But data centers pose a variety of climate and environmental problems, including their impact on the water supply. The volume of water needed to cool the servers in data centers — most of which need to be kept at 70 to 80 degrees to run effectively — has become a nationwide water resource issue particularly in areas facing water scarcity across the West. This year, a Bloomberg News analysis found that roughly “two-thirds of new data centers built or in development since 2022 are in places already gripped by high levels of water stress.” Droughts have plagued Morrow County, <a href="https://elkhornmediagroup.com/morrow-county-declares-drought-emergency/">occurring annually</a> since 2020. But even areas with ample water reserves are vulnerable to the outsized demand from data centers. Earlier this year, the International Energy Agency reported that data centers could consume 1,200 billion liters by 2030 worldwide, nearly double the 560 billion liters of water they use currently.</p>
<p>The volume of water isn’t the most pressing problem in Morrow County, however. The issue is pollution, which Amazon’s data centers have exacerbated since their arrival.</p>
<p>In response to a request for comment, Amazon spokesperson Lisa Levandowski replied that “the apparent narrative” of this story “is misleading and inaccurate.” Levandowski went on to say: “The truth is that this region has long-documented groundwater quality challenges that significantly predate AWS’ presence, and federal, state, and local agencies have spent years working to address nitrates from agricultural fertilizer, manure, septic systems, and wastewater from food processing plants. Our data centers draw water from the same supply as other community members; nitrates are not an additive we use in any of our processes, and the volume of water our facilities use and return represents only a very small fraction of the overall water system — not enough to have any meaningful impact on water quality.”</p>
<blockquote> <p>“One man about 60 years old had his voice box taken out because of a cancer only smokers get, but that guy hadn’t smoked a day of his life.”</p>Jim Doherty, former Morrow County commissioner</blockquote>
<p>Morrow is an unlikely location for an agricultural juggernaut. Essentially desert country, its porous, sandy soil is inhospitable to all but a few types of shallow-root crops. Yet over the past few decades, it was transformed by a group of entrepreneurial local officials and farm operators who leveraged chemical fertilizers to make the desert bloom.</p>
<p>To compensate for the dry conditions and create more capacity for large agricultural operations, vast irrigation systems were built in the 1990s by officials at the Port of Morrow, the county’s transportation and food-processing hub along the bank of the Columbia River. Increased water flow meant large agricultural companies could use fertilizers in fields year-round. That drew some of the Pacific Northwest’s largest dairy concerns and producers of onions and potatoes to Morrow County. Lamb Weston, which supplies virtually all of the potatoes for McDonald’s french fries, set up shop. So did Threemile Canyon Farms, one of the largest dairy operators in the nation.</p>
<p>The massive inputs of fertilizer to grow crops and feed for the animals came at a price: the contamination of the Lower Umatilla Basin. In 1992, DEQ measured an average nitrate concentration of 9.2 ppm across a cluster of wells pulling from the basin. By 2015, that average had risen 46 percent, to 15.3 ppm. For some wells, DEQ found nitrate levels nearly as high as 73 ppm, more than 10 times the state limit of 7 ppm.</p>
<p>Every day, the megafarms and food processing plants in Morrow County send millions of gallons of wastewater to the Port of Morrow. The Port in turn pumps it to one of several lagoons that hold tens or hundreds of millions of gallons of tainted water. Vast pools of this wastewater are covered in football field-sized tarps, which trap the solids that rise to the surface. Microbes metabolize some of the solids, expelling methane gas which then burns out of thin chimney pipes sticking up from the tarps, the flames flickering atop like birthday candles. Once the solid waste has burned off, the water under the tarp is laden with residual nitrogen chemicals — the remains of the fertilizers, animal manure, and plant material. At no cost to farm operators, the Port then pumps that nitrogen-dense water back out onto the farms, where nitrogen turns into nitrates when it interacts with the soil. It is a novel recycling process that alleviates the Port’s wastewater burden and offers farms a steady flow of highly concentrated fertilized water to expand their industrial-ag footprints.</p>
<figure><figcaption> Wastewater lagoons operated by the Port of Morrow. The Port sprays this nitrogen chemical-laced water over the area’s farmland as fertilizer.  Food &amp; Water Watch and Oregon Rural Action </figcaption></figure>
<p>When the Port sprays that water back over the farms, some of the nitrates are absorbed by the crops, but there’s a limit to how much the sandy soil and shallow-root plants can hold before it leaks all the way through the dirt, polluting the aquifer below. “The aquifer is basically one giant sandbox, and the water flows through there very quickly,” says Chad Gubala, a hydrologist who managed Oregon DEQ’s oversight of the Port of Morrow’s wastewater permit from 2018 to 2022. Once the crops have absorbed what they can, the rest of the nitrates “get flushed right through [to the basin].”</p>
<p>Experts say Amazon’s arrival supercharged this process. The data centers suck up tens of millions of gallons of water from the aquifer each year to cool their computer equipment, which then gets funneled to the Port’s wastewater system. All of the data center water gets mixed into the dirty lagoon wastewater, which only increases how much water the Port must then discard over the fields. As Greg Pettit, who served at the DEQ for 38 years and led the development of Oregon’s Groundwater Quality, explains, “the more water you put on, the faster you’re going to drive the nitrogen through the soil and down into the aquifer.”</p>
<p>Gubula is likewise critical of how the Port historically has dealt with the overwhelming volume of wastewater, which included spraying the fields during the cold winter months, even when no crops were planted. “This idea of winter irrigation was the goofiest thing on God’s green earth,” he says. “The farmers and the Port facility folks argued that maintaining irrigation during a non-growing season was a reasonable thing to keep the soil ‘in appropriate condition’ they called it, so it’d be ready for spring seed sowing and early growth. Well, it was functionally a load of shit, a way to maintain year-round discharge of wastewater from their facilities.” (In an Oct. 30 press release, the Port pledged to end the practice this winter. The Port’s executive director, Lisa Mittelsdorf, told <em>Rolling Stone</em> in a statement, “The Port and DEQ have worked together to ban non-growing season land application of industrial wastewater.”)</p>
<p>The nonstop spraying during the winter months helped the Port and Amazon manage the incredible volume of wastewater coming out of the farms and data centers, but it raised alarm bells for DEQ rank-and-file analysts. The winter irrigation practice “provides a significant risk to … to groundwater,” Larry Brown, a DEQ environmental health specialist, wrote in an email in 2023, summarizing concerns he had shared with DEQ administrators a year earlier. “[It] must be phased out as soon as reasonably possible.” The warning signs were ignored.</p>
<p>As the underground aquifer became tainted with more nitrates, even the ostensibly clean water that the Port pulled from the aquifer’s deepest wells — which it used to service its large industrial customers like Amazon — became polluted. Soon, Amazon was using water to cool its data warehouses with nitrates as high as 13 ppm — above the federal and state limits.</p>
<p>When that tainted water moves through the data centers to absorb heat from the server systems, some of the water is evaporated, but the nitrates remain, increasing the concentration. That means that when the polluted water has moved through the data centers and back into the wastewater system, it’s even more contaminated, sometimes averaging as high as 56 ppm, eight times Oregon’s safety limit.</p>
<p>ON JUNE 9, 2022, JIM DOHERTY called a public hearing for the county commission to vote on a state of emergency for the county’s drinking water. As word spread about the meeting, some residents were angry — and not necessarily about the health threat. Many feared an emergency declaration would expose the county to intervention by the Oregon DEQ or the federal Environmental Protection Agency, whose regulators might shut down businesses to halt the contamination.</p>
<blockquote> <p>“The historical precedent here is Flint, Michigan, in part because of who’s affected. These are people with no political or economic power and little knowledge of the risk.”</p>Kristin Ostrom, director of advocacy group Oregon Rural Action</blockquote>
<p>Local residents and farm managers packed the hearing at the county courthouse in the town of Heppner, with dozens more watching the livestream. “Our legacy will be what we are doing now,” Doherty said of the emergency decree. The county, he argued, needed to unlock emergency funds to buy bottled water for anyone living with tainted wells and provide test kits to the thousands of residents who didn’t yet know if they were drinking polluted water.</p>
<p>Melissa Lindsay was one of Doherty’s fellow county commissioners, elected the same year as him. She said she had reservations about the state of emergency, because it would mean giving broad authority to the governor over resource allocation, emergency services, and communication about the crisis to the public. Doherty disagreed. He had received a phone call from then-Gov. Kate Brown a few days earlier, and she’d offered emergency assistance without strings attached. “She did not say they would come run our county,” Doherty said.</p>
<p>That was enough for Lindsay, but not everyone at the meeting was swayed. The agricultural operators who accounted for the $2 billion local economy remained wary. Doherty says one farm manager spent 15 minutes at a second meeting telling him “what a godawful person I was for trying to shut down farming and the local ag industry.”</p>
<p>The tensions laid bare the economic realities of Morrow County, a place where the gap between rich and poor is extreme. Roughly 30 percent of the county lives in mobile homes — the vast majority of which rely on well water — and 40 percent live below the poverty line. Meanwhile, the top five percent earn an average income of $374,000, more than 20 times the bottom 20 percent. These farm managers and factory executives tend to live in McMansions scattered around the countryside or in manicured developments in Boardman. In sharp contrast to the potholed gravel roads and slanted bungalows where the workers live, the new developments have freshly paved streets and sidewalks, and they drink and cook with water from city water pipes that go deep into the aquifer, where the water is less concentrated with nitrates — although the contamination levels for even the deepest wells are starting to rise.</p>
<p>At the end of the June 9 meeting, commissioner Lindsay endorsed the declaration — a move that would free up county funds for bottled water and prompt the state to open up its own emergency response coffers. “The safe drinking water of our constituents is number one,” Lindsay said. Her vote, along with Doherty’s, was enough. The third commissioner, Don Russell, who had worked at the Port before winning a seat on the county board, did not show up to the emergency hearing.</p>

<p>With the initial $250,000 in emergency funds, <a href="https://www.salemreporter.com/2022/07/25/morrow-county-waits-months-for-state-money-to-help-with-contaminated-drinking-water/">the county</a> hired water trucks for well users to fill large jugs. Health officials began distributing bilingual flyers that warned wells could be tainted, advising that “residents who have a high level of nitrate in their well water should not boil their water. Boiling does not get rid of nitrate.” By the end of the summer, the county had spent $500,000 addressing the water problem, including additional deliveries of bottled water to residents’ homes. Despite the concern about the state’s involvement, the county received little help from state agencies and lawmakers.</p>
<p>Doherty was particularly upset that Gov. Brown didn’t release a statement supporting the county. He pressured her office about the $4 million in emergency funds he’d requested, but the county only <a href="https://oregoncapitalchronicle.com/2022/09/26/state-legislators-approve-nearly-6-million-for-water-emergencies-in-rural-oregon/">received</a> $881,000 from the state for testing and home water-filtration kits. Doherty suspected that the lobbyists representing Morrow County business interests were working behind the scenes to thwart an aggressive state-level intervention. “That was the mafia mentality at work,” he says. “‘We’re going to take care of it, don’t you worry about it. Just keep it in the family.’” (Former Gov. Brown declined to directly address these allegations, instead suggesting <em>Rolling Stone</em> file a public records request.)</p>
<p>Other state agencies seemed to fall in line with farm operators’ assertion that this wasn’t much of an emergency, and if it was, the burden of solving the problem lay with the agriculture industry and not the state. “[To] move the needle on reducing contamination to healthy levels … it’s going to take work and creative solutions from farmers, ranchers, homeowners, really anyone who uses water or land in this area,” a DEQ spokesperson said that June.</p>
<p>By September 2022, 248 additional homes had been found to have nitrate levels above the state’s safety limit. At another packed town hall meeting, “county leaders and people with contaminated wells expressed growing frustration at the lack of direct intervention from the state in public testimony,” one local newspaper wrote in its coverage. Despite several invitations, Gov. Brown did not attend, nor did any representatives from DEQ or Oregon Health Authority.</p>
<p>Speaking to the crowd, Doherty emphasized the significance of raising awareness among the worker enclaves. Some immigrants in the area, many of whom <a href="https://www.opb.org/article/2023/06/03/oregon-agriculture-farmworkers-farms-farmers-morrow-county-pay-housing/">are undocumented,</a> were reluctant to seek help. According to several sources with direct knowledge of the incidents, managers at several of the food processing plants and farm operations were telling employees that the emergency declaration was a bad-faith campaign that would endanger their jobs. Gathering at town halls or speaking about the pollution to reporters was tantamount to inviting the shutdown of your place of employment. Doherty tried to counter the disinformation: “We need you. We need you to walk across the street and talk to your neighbor,” he told the crowd. “You need to talk to your friend or, better yet, make a new damn friend, tell them to test their water.”</p>
<figure><figcaption> Morrow County residents meeting with state officials about nitrate contamination in their water. “Out of the kitchen sink is the way we all get our life,” one local wrote to then-county commissioner Jim Doherty in late 2022. “Make it right. You’re the man to do it.”  Oregon Rural Action </figcaption></figure>
<p>But as word continued to spread across the county that residents had potentially been drinking contaminated water for years, if not decades, Doherty was besieged with emails, texts, and Facebook messages from concerned residents who encouraged him to fight the pollution. “Out of the kitchen sink is the way we all get our life,” one local wrote to Doherty. “Make it right. You’re the man to do it.”</p>
<p>Another person contacted him who had just moved away. “My husband had kidney cancer in his early 40s. His doctor thought it was due to exposure to herbicides and pesticides. He lost a kidney but he lived,” she wrote. “We had acceptable levels of [toxins in our] drinking water when we first moved there. After my husband’s cancer we realized they went up and up through the years. It’s very sad.”</p>
<p>Some of the larger agriculture operators in the area, including Tillamook Creamery and Lamb Weston, offered financial support to people who needed water. But they stopped short of acknowledging that they might have played a part in the water crisis. (Tillamook did not reply to multiple requests for comment on this story from <em>Rolling Stone</em>. Lamb Weston replied in a statement that “while only a very small percent of nitrates, as confirmed by the Oregon DEQ, are attributable to the land application of food processing water, we are committed to doing our part to protect safe drinking water in the region. Among other actions, we are improving water treatment to reduce the nitrogen content in our process water and taking steps to reduce water use, including the amount of process water ultimately land-applied as irrigation.”)</p>
<blockquote> <p>“[Local officials] knew from the get-go how big Amazon would become in Morrow County. They planned for it and watched it all happen.”</p>Melissa Lindsay, former Morrow County commissioner</blockquote>
<p>The Port, which is overseen by the county, issued its own anodyne statement at the time, never conceding any role in the problem. “The Port of Morrow welcomes the County’s emergency declaration on groundwater,” the statement read. “This has been a community issue for decades and it is past time to address the issue on a regional basis. The Port is eager to play its role in finding workable solutions.” Lisa Mittelsdorf, executive director of the Port, said in an email to <em>Rolling Stone</em> that the “DEQ has consistently acknowledged Port operations have had minimal effect on nitrate levels in the basin’s groundwater.” Since 2011 Oregon DEQ has issued more than <a href="https://apps.oregon.gov/oregon-newsroom/OR/DEQ/Posts/Post/deq-fines-port-of-morrow--1-3-million-for-nitrate-violations-in-area-with-groundwater-contamination-35975">a thousand violations</a> and more than $3 million in fines against the Port for excessive spraying of nitrate-laden water over farmland.</p>
<p>Amazon pitched in money as well, “to help neighbors, families, and workers impacted by the water emergency,” as the company put it in a press release. Behind closed doors, however, members of Amazon’s legal, communications, and AWS teams debated the cost of being associated with the industrial agriculture operators who, in the public imagination at least, were the cause of the pollution.</p>
<p>“Is there any risk in having our name in this, or any reason why we wouldn’t do this?” one staffer wrote, according to a review of hundreds of internal emails obtained through a public records request.</p>
<p>“There is always potential for some risk of affiliation with the causation,” Amazon director of public policy Roger Wehner wrote, though he underscored how the company’s donation would “also offer an opportunity to position AWS [as] an engaged corporate citizen doing good for the community.”</p>
<p>Being seen as an “engaged corporate citizen” would be helpful to Amazon as it negotiated for the next round of multibillion-dollar tax abatements from Morrow County’s business development committee for building out five new data centers. “This is a rare, highly impactful opportunity (could critically help influence $2b incentives) in our 2nd largest region globally. … We simply cannot miss the window given high risk/impact to the business,” AWS economic development principal Hillary Lambert wrote in the email thread.</p>
<p>“Our absence … will be noted not only by the public but also very important stakeholders who 1) hold the keys to $2B of tax abatements currently in negotiation for the business 2) gate keep for key land acquisitions to meet supply needs, and 3) facilitate our permitting and water/fiber infrastructure approvals,” wrote one AWS team member. “All of which are very critical for our continued success.”</p>
<p>Amazon spokesperson Lisa Levandowski characterized the use of these quotes from the emails as “misleading,” adding, “We have been investing and creating jobs in eastern Oregon since before the launch of our data centers there. Any suggestion that our support during this emergency was connected to tax negotiations or regulatory approvals misrepresents the facts — our response was driven by our commitment to the community’s well-being.”</p>

<p>Doherty wasn’t surprised by the corporate messaging and philanthropic support by Amazon and the other major industrial players in Morrow County. It was in their interest to curry favor with the public, particularly if it meant they could avoid any commitment to altering the wastewater management practices that continued to exacerbate the crisis.</p>
<p>But it wasn’t just the C-suite executives who were keeping a close eye on Doherty’s emergency declaration. Behind the scenes, powerful local officials were coordinating their own response.</p>
<p>MORROW COUNTY’S TRANSFORMATION from a rural backwater into an agricultural powerhouse is, in many ways, the work of a single man. Gary Neal was elected general manager of the Port of Morrow in 1989, when the waterfront terminal was still a modest operation. Built in the 1960s as a rail and shipping hub to distribute the county’s crops and dairy products, it had one dock and only a few food processors.</p>
<p>That’s where Neal came in. Over the course of more than 30 years, utilizing grants and revenue bonds to finance infrastructure investments, Neal built miles of rail track at the Port to ship exports out to the Union Pacific line. Hundreds of acres of land owned by the Port were rezoned for industrial use, hooked up to new water and waste pipes, and powered by substations installed near the Port after Neal lobbied the local utilities. Creating plug-and-play spaces for new industrial tenants allowed Neal to court increasingly larger businesses to sites that had “all the services” they could need, he said during one board meeting. (Neal did not respond to multiple requests for comment for this story.)</p>
<p>Neal also built roads and irrigation systems, constructed fiber optic internet connections for business offices, and expanded a network of pumps and pipes that collected the wastewater from the food and dairy operators. By 2017, the Port was doing $2.8 billion in annual business. In 2019, state lawmakers passed a resolution honoring Neal, noting that when he had taken over the Port “the local economy was in rough shape with high unemployment” and that through his “vision and leadership,” it was now “one of the most productive areas in the state of Oregon.”</p>
<figure><figcaption> Morrow County is essentially desert country, but has been irrigated over the decades to facilitate the growth of factory farms in the area including Tillamook Creamery, which produces 180 million pounds of cheese annually, and Lamb Weston, the largest frozen potato producer in North America. Food &amp; Water Watch and Oregon Rural Action </figcaption></figure>
<p>Neal’s pumps and pipes were an essential part of the vision. It was Neal who built the massive lagoons that effectively recycled the fertilizer used by the farm and food operators. This created another incentive for industrial expansion, as the wastewater was free in exchange for taking it off the Port’s hands, and it significantly reduced how much farm operators had to spend on fertilizers. “[We] beneficially reuse approximately 3.6 billion gallons per year of industrial wastewater generated by the food processing and other industrial facilities,” the Port wrote in a 2022 statement touting their wastewater program. The chemical-laced water “provides the local farmers with a valuable service,” delivering “nutrient rich wastewater … in this water-deficient region.”</p>
<p>In 1989, Neal took a seat on the Columbia River Enterprise Zone (CREZ), a committee that decides which areas are designated for business development incentives. Handing out tax breaks on the committee made him popular with businesspeople. Major additions to the Port during his tenure included Lamb Weston (the largest frozen potato producer in North America, with a more than $9 billion market cap) and Tillamook Creamery (a $1.2 billion operation that produces 180 million pounds of cheese annually). By the beginning of the 2010s, the Port employed around 8,450 full-time workers, a 36 percent increase from 2006.</p>
<p>“He took sand and sagebrush and turned it into the second-largest port in the state,” wrote Oregon Rep. Greg Smith, a co-sponsor of the resolution honoring Neal. Smith had worked with Neal at the Port before his election to the statehouse in 2001. “I don’t think many people would have the foresight like Gary,” said J.R. Cook, an agriculture industry consultant, when he spoke to the county commission about how Neal utilized his zoning authority. “Looking back on it now, it was a stroke of genius.”</p>
<p>Neal developed a reputation as an adept bureaucratic salesman, but one with a sometimes combative style. “It became widely known that you didn’t speak out against Gary or anyone on his committees,” says Jim Doherty. “Folks out here started to call them the mafia. He wanted to build up the Port and do his deals, and by and large he did them. If he needed approval from the state to build pipes under the highway, or whatever it was, he’d rather do the crime and pay the fine before he wasted the time and effort to go through the proper channels. That was his mindset.”</p>
<p>Those tactics became apparent in the deals to expand Amazon’s data centers. Amazon initially came to the county in 2008, three years before it opened its first data center. The company agreed to pay $1.6 million for 80 acres along the Port’s waterfront on the condition that no one involved in the deal could publicly acknowledge Amazon’s involvement, according to Don Russell, who was on the county commission at the time. (Amazon spokesperson Levandowski called the company’s use of nondisclosure agreements “an industry-wide common practice.” Russell did not respond to multiple requests for comment.) Using strict nondisclosure agreements, Amazon required Neal, who effectively led negotiations with the tech giant, and his colleagues, to refer publicly to the Silicon Valley giant as VAData, a holding company. Jerry Healy, a Port commissioner involved in the deal, would later tell an investigator at the Oregon Ethics Commission that no one was “permitted to use the word Amazon.” (Healy did not respond to multiple requests for comment.) But it wasn’t long before news of Morrow County landing business with one of the world’s largest companies leaked out. “Everyone knew who they were,” Healy said.</p>

<p>By the time the first data center opened in 2011, Neal and his team were already lobbying state legislators for better tax incentive packages that would benefit Amazon. In 2015, those efforts bore fruit: The state passed Senate Bill 611, which exempted data centers from central assessment taxation. Amazon state public policy adviser Eileen Sullivan testified before the Oregon Senate Committee on Finance and Revenue that the bill made it possible for the company to build at least 11 new data centers. “It goes back to jobs and stability,” Neal told reporters. “This helps us round out our economy.”</p>
<p>In 2017, with these new tax breaks in his pocket, Neal began negotiating with Amazon in secret CREZ executive sessions to bring in five more data centers that were each worth $1.9 billion, with footprints twice or triple the size of the first. The tax abatement rules would allow the county, the Port of Morrow, and the city of Boardman to trade tax abatements worth between $1 and $2 billion to the tech giant over the next 15 years.</p>
<p>The question was what the county would get in exchange for that trade. As the negotiations got underway, Melissa Lindsay joined Jim Doherty as a freshman board member on the County Commission. A fourth-generation farmer with 12,000 acres of rolling hills about 25 miles south of the Port, Lindsay was aware of Neal’s success on the waterfront. “The economy that he essentially created here brought him a lot of power and respect,” she tells me.</p>
<p>She’d been eager to work with Neal on the CREZ committee that was in talks with Amazon. Her goal was to win commitments from the company to provide funds for the school district and emergency services in exchange for the tax breaks. But in CREZ meetings — which along with the three county commissioners included the elected leaders of the city of Boardman, plus Neal and his deputies, who’d been appointed to their roles by the elected Port commissioners — she was struck by how deferential everyone was toward Neal, and seemingly supportive of every one of his ideas and decisions. “He came across as this steward of the county,” Lindsay says.</p>
<p>With everyone following Neal’s lead, Lindsay realized that other than her and Doherty, no one was interested in wringing much out of Amazon. The deal, it seemed to Lindsay, was already done, and Amazon would give up little to secure the tax abatements.</p>
<p>Lindsay raised her concerns with Marv Padberg, a commissioner working under Neal at the Port. According to Lindsay, Padberg urged her to avoid meddling and let Neal and his team work with Amazon behind closed doors. “Melissa, you just need to figure out the easy button,” she says Padberg told her. (Padberg did not respond to multiple requests for comment.)</p>
<p>Lindsay says she also spoke to Sandy Toms, the mayor of Boardman, who represented the city on the enterprise committee and who frequently made the first or second motion for Neal’s proposals. Toms, Lindsay says, brushed off her concerns. (Toms died in 2024.)</p>
<p>“I kept pointing out that we’re negotiating billions of dollars,” Lindsay says. “But I was just laughed at, or accused of being jealous, or described as being hard to work with.”</p>
<p>She noted that her attempts to bring in outside financial advisers or attorneys to negotiate on behalf of the committee were dismissed as unnecessary. Eventually, she was no longer included in talks about the deal with Amazon. That year, Amazon broke ground on the first of the five data centers, a 200,000-square-foot facility with the energy demand equivalent of 30,000 homes and a 15-year tax abatement worth nearly $200 million.</p>
<p>In 2018, after 29 years as the Port director, Gary Neal stepped down. His son, Ryan, was chosen by the elected members of the Port commission as his successor — a selection process that included Gary’s input on potential candidates, according to sources familiar with the appointment. Gary stayed on with the Port as an informal adviser, frequently traveling with his son to meetings with representatives of Amazon and other industrial clients. (Ryan Neal died of Covid complications in 2022 and was succeeded by Lisa Mittelsdorf.)</p>

<p>Melissa Lindsay, for her part, could never understand why Neal was so willing to give in to Amazon’s demands. “It was brutal to watch how we got nothing for it,” she says of the deals. “But you couldn’t stop it. No matter what idea you brought up for a better deal, you were met with extreme pushback.”</p>
<p>IN 2008, PAT LAURITSEN MOVED to Heppner from Tri-Cities, Washington, to join a struggling fiber optic company called Windwave. An experienced telecom salesperson, Lauritsen would eventually take over Windwave’s operation as CEO to “try to make money with the company instead of just losing it all the time,” she says.</p>
<p>Some of those losses were born of Windwave’s unusual corporate structure. Windwave was a for-profit subsidiary of a nonprofit called Inland Development Corporation. Inland’s mission was to provide much-needed fiber optic internet to remote rural hospitals and schools, which didn’t pay well; Windwave was a commercial pursuit, hooking up internet to industrial clients and private businesses in eastern Oregon. But for years after Windwave was founded in 2004, the profits didn’t materialize.</p>
<p>Lauritsen answered to two distinct boards of directors that shared several members and largely functioned as one oversight body. The board members — who included Gary Neal, Don Russell, Jerry Healy, and Marv Padberg — always seemed skeptical that Windwave would survive. “Gary Neal at every board meeting told me that it’d be a zillion years before we’d become a viable company,” Lauritsen says. “They didn’t expect that we would ever make it.”</p>
<p>None of the board members had experience in commercial telecom. Instead, they’d been selected by Lauritsen’s predecessor for their influence in the region’s agriculture-dominated industry. “I don’t know a thing about putting fiber in the ground,” Healy, who had served on the Port commission since 1994, later told an investigator from the Oregon Ethics Commission. He said that Neal and the other board members focused instead on “financial performance, income statements, balance sheets, cash flows, [and] to set policy.” Often, at board meetings, the public officials would evaluate the real estate tied to fiber optic projects for potential disposal of the Port’s wastewater. “Right from the beginning I thought, ‘Oh, this doesn’t look good,’” Lauritsen says.</p>
<p>In 2010, Amazon signed a nearly million-dollar deal with Windwave to install and service miles of underground fiber optic lines for its first data center. Suddenly, Lauritsen noticed, the board members viewed Windwave in a new light. “When we turned the corner and were making a real profit, Don Russell said to the board, ‘Oh man, we need to look at this, there might actually be some money in the company.’”</p>
<p>For Amazon, there was terrific efficiency to doing business in Morrow County. Gary Neal and his fellow public officials negotiated lucrative tax breaks for new data centers from their positions on the CREZ board, while at the same time Neal and the others oversaw Windwave’s board of directors, hammering out what would become dozens of contracts as Amazon’s primary fiber optic service provider. Likewise, in his role as the general manager of the Port, Neal ensured that Amazon had no problem dispensing with tens of millions of gallons of its nitrate-laced wastewater. Morrow County, it seemed, had become a one-stop shop for Amazon’s data centers. (Amazon spokesperson Levandowski told <em>Rolling Stone</em>, “We work with local officials in their official capacities as representatives of their communities and jurisdictions. Economic development discussions, utility planning, and infrastructure services are handled through standard procurement and regulatory processes with appropriate oversight and transparency.”)</p>
<p>Lauritsen says she wasn’t aware that members of the Windwave board were negotiating tax breaks with Amazon or managing the data center wastewater as they were making deals for Windwave fiber optic. She was too busy working 60-hour weeks trying to install enough underground concrete vaults and wire conduits to keep up with the demand from the Amazon campuses. Indeed, according to Lindsay, much of Amazon’s dealings with Morrow County officials were kept secret, with those officials often citing NDAs with Amazon as a pretext to move public discussions into private executive sessions.</p>
<p>In 2016, Gary Neal and his associates embarked on a campaign that would transform Windwave and line their own pockets: an effort to spin off Windwave from Inland and set it up as a stand-alone company — with Neal and the other officials as owners and equal partners. Lauritsen assumed the idea was Neal’s: “No decision was ever made that Gary didn’t say what he thought first and then the other ones would follow suit,” she says.</p>
<p>Lauritsen says she was the only member of the Windwave board who objected to slicing up the company into equal portions shared by Neal, Healy, Padberg, Russell, and Blake Lawrence, another board member who’d helped Lauritsen manage construction. (Lawrence did not respond to multiple requests for comment.) She suggested instead that it should be an employee-owned operation as a reward for the loyal crew that had spent years building the fiber optic network that became the backbone of Amazon’s data center enterprise. “I thought they deserved to have that money go to their 401(k)s and not to the board members who didn’t even believe in the company,” she says. “I asked Gary why did he think that they deserved to have the company and the money it would make, and his comment back to me was, ‘They got their wages, didn’t they?’”</p>
<p>The tension between Lauritsen and the other board members sharpened as she declined an offer to join them as a part owner. “The Inland papers of incorporation write it out fairly clear at the top: No board member is allowed to make or do anything with the company for personal profit,” she says. The hostilities weren’t always subtle, with Padberg at one point warning her to “be careful,” she recalls, which she took as a threat. (Padberg did not respond to requests for comment.) Lauritsen resigned from Windwave in 2017; Lawrence replaced her as CEO, and the five men completed the buyout of the company in May 2018.</p>
<p>News of their financial maneuvering did eventually come to light. An explosive investigation published by <em>The Oregonian </em>in September 2022 accused Amazon of “benefiting mightily from the deals it cut with local officials.” The article quoted Lindsay and Doherty. “Incentives were given,” Lindsay said. “It wasn’t always clear what other benefits people at the table might be receiving.” Doherty alleged that Neal and the others had been “working these deals behind the scenes … [setting] themselves up for a windfall.” (An attorney for Neal submitted a letter to the Oregon Ethics Commission claiming Neal recused himself from two discussions of Amazon business and that “all the objective information … demonstrates that no offense or violation occurred during the period at issue.” Russell <a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/silicon-forest/2022/09/how-leaders-in-a-small-oregon-town-positioned-themselves-for-an-amazon-windfall.html">told <em>The Oregonian</em></a> that his investment in Windwave was his “private business” and defended his approval of tax breaks for Amazon based on the company’s economic contributions to the region.)</p>
<p>There was no accountability for anyone involved until this past July, when Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield sued the men (and three “disinterested directors” recruited by the owners to approve the sale from the Inland board) in circuit court, alleging that these “established community leaders” had “abused their authority and breached the public trust for their personal financial gain.” In a press release announcing the lawsuit, Rayfield said “this nonprofit was created to connect eastern Oregon communities — not to quietly enrich a handful of officials behind closed doors.”</p>
<p>In the lawsuit, Rayfield describes in detail how Neal and the others went about taking Windwave. Their first step was to arrange for a sale price that was well under the actual value of the company. To do that, “the Insiders” — which is how Rayfield described Neal, Healy, Padberg, and Russell — had to get around the Cogence Group, a financial forensics and business valuation firm, which was brought in to conduct a valuation of Windwave.</p>
<blockquote> <p>“The people responsible for the pollution are huge mega-corporations with a lot of power. And they’ve been getting away with this for decades now.”</p>Attorney Steve Berman, who has filed a class action suit related to the water crisis</blockquote>
<p>According to Rayfield, the men did this by withholding important financial information about Windwave, namely the lucrative deals they were negotiating with Amazon Web Services. Without that information, Cogence put Windwave’s fair market value at $1.8 million. But Windwave’s new owners knew the company’s value was about to soar, thanks to the Amazon contracts in the pipeline.</p>
<p>In March 2018, a change in federal tax law led Cogence to increase Windwave’s valuation to $2.6 million. The board members purchased Windwave at that price two months later. But that figure was still far below the firm’s actual value. The AG estimated that at the time Windwave was worth “at least $9.5 million.” All told, they’d reaped $6.9 million in savings by keeping information from Cogence.</p>
<p>But these insiders did more than just hide the company’s value, according to Rayfield. They also ignored the advice of Inland’s attorneys to seek what’s called a “fairness opinion” before the purchase, to ensure an organization is treated fairly by its directors. And they used their seats on the board to approve two loans to themselves from Inland’s nonprofit coffers to cover the entire $2.6 purchase price. What’s more, those loans, according to the AG, had “sub-market interest rates [that] required a one-time balloon payment of the loan’s balance after five years.”</p>
<p>The sale of Windwave did not end its financial relationship with Inland — it sweetened it. Inland hired Windwave to continue “its charitable mission of serving rural Oregonians” with fiber optic connections for “schools, libraries, hospitals, courts, law enforcement, and veteran’s services.” Only now Inland would have to pay Windwave $200,000 a year over the next five years, ensuring another million-dollar stream of revenue beyond the Amazon data centers. (Windwave later almost doubled the fees it charged its former parent company, earning $350,000 from Inland in 2019, according to the nonprofit’s IRS filings.) Before the sale was complete, Healy sought one final concession, massaging the terms of the sub-market loan so that Windwave wouldn’t have to repay the balloon payment “for at least another five years,” according to emails cited in Rayfield’s filing.</p>
<p>The sequence of events is complex, but worth summarizing for its audacity. Gary Neal and his partners wrested control of Windwave from its nonprofit parent and sold it to themselves, hiding insider knowledge of lucrative deals with Amazon to keep the price low. They financed the purchase from Inland with money from Inland itself, with below-market loan terms, and made sure that Inland continued to pay them for fiber optic services. They also ensured that they wouldn’t have to pay that money back to Inland for a decade, even as they made millions as Windwave’s new owners.</p>
<p>The AG’s civil suit seeks a minimum of $6.9 million in damages from Neal and the other Windwave owners, the difference between the falsely undervalued original sale price and the actual estimated value at the time. It also seeks to void the sale itself and return Windwave to Inland. “It’s incredibly clear that their motivations were based on profit, and they were willing to use insider information to facilitate their desire to make money,” Rayfield says. “These were elected officials, people in positions of trust in the community, who were cutting deals with Amazon. At the same time, they knew those deals they were sitting on would cause the profits of this company they wanted to purchase to explode.”</p>
<p>News of the lawsuit ripped through Morrow County in July. Many residents were outraged, and relieved that powerful public officials were finally being held to account for at least some of their misdeeds, even if it wasn’t for the water pollution. On local Facebook groups, commenters expressed disgust at “the cloud of corruption and exploitation behind it all,” as one person wrote. “They were sitting on boards and commissions meant to represent the public while secretly enriching themselves — using insider knowledge of Amazon’s data center expansion that was never shared with the public.” Another person wrote, “Justice rides a slow horse, but it does eventually arrive.”</p>
<p>Rayfield has not ruled out the possibility of pressing criminal charges, including fraud, if the evidence he uncovers during discovery can be pursued under existing statutes of limitations. He’s also left open the possibility that he could add Amazon as a defendant to the civil suit. “Amazon was benefiting from the business deals they were getting,” he told <em>The Oregonian</em>. “It created an economic incentive to be in the area. They chose to make those internal business decisions and be in the community based upon those things.” (In September, attorneys for the Windwave defendants sought to have the suit dismissed, citing in part the state’s approval of the sale of Windwave; days later the attorney amended that motion, acknowledging that Windwave board members had not been transparent about their forthcoming business with Amazon while the deal was underway.)</p>
<p>When reports of the Windwave deal reached Melissa Lindsay, her confusion over Neal’s softball negotiating tactics with Amazon disappeared. “They literally gave up taxpayer money for the sake of putting money into their own pockets. They knew from the get-go how big Amazon would become in Morrow County,” she says. “They knew it, they planned for it, and they watched it all happen. It’s wild.”</p>
<p>MELISSA LINDSAY AND JIM DOHERTY would pay a stiff price for speaking out publicly against Neal and the Windwave owners in their dealings with Amazon. In October 2022, a month after <em>The Oregonian</em> investigation was published, several of Neal’s longtime political allies launched a recall campaign against both commissioners. Annetta Spicer, a former district attorney in Morrow County and a longtime associate of Neal, filed the petition. She framed Doherty’s efforts around the water emergency as a way to gain votes among the area’s Latino voters. (Spicer did not respond to repeated requests for comment.) “I don’t have a problem with the Hispanic citizens being treated appropriately,” she told Oregon Public Broadcasting. “But [Doherty is] not following through and solving the problem for them.”</p>
<p>Public officials and business leaders with close ties to Neal and his Windwave partners supported the recall campaign, with aggressive attacks at public events and on social media against Doherty and Lindsay’s character and motives. The campaign corresponded with decreased sales for Doherty’s cattle business. Lindsay says, “It was horrible for myself and my family. It was very painful. They’d gotten away with it for so long. They thought they were untouchable — and they were.”</p>
<p>In November 2022, the votes were cast. The 165- and 21-vote margins against Doherty and Lindsay, respectively, were enough to remove them from the county commission, effective immediately.</p>
<p>Doherty and Lindsay weren’t the only ones facing consequences for their actions. With the two commissioners out of office, the advocacy group Oregon Rural Action stepped up its efforts to lobby Oregon lawmakers and Brown’s successor, Gov. Tina Kotek, to intervene in Morrow County. In November 2023, they hosted a group of state representatives for a tour of homes where wells had nitrate levels as high as 45 ppm.</p>
<p>During the tour, Kaleb Lay, ORA’s research and policy director, said one of his colleagues got a call that his truck was on fire. The ORA member rushed to the vehicle and discovered it torched. Flyers explaining how residents could receive free nitrate tests had been removed from the truck and ripped up, lying in pieces on the street just a few feet away.</p>
<p>The fire department — some of whose members had publicly griped about Doherty and Lindsay — initially suggested the fire was an act of arson, with one firefighter stating so via the company’s dispatch and later noting the presence of turpentine, a flammable solvent. But the fire marshal, Marty Broadbent, told me in November the arson designation “was an internal glitch on our part … something you should never say on the radio.” The identification of turpentine, he said, was also a mistake. He attributed both errors “to one of the firefighters who didn’t have any fire investigation skills,” adding, “We’ve since changed our protocol.” Ultimately, the department ruled the fire an accident and closed its investigation.</p>

<p>In November 2024, I sat down with a woman named Kathy Mendoza at her home in Boardman. She’d prepared a plate of cookies she baked that morning, set atop the red tablecloth of her dining room table. With us were members of ORA. Mendoza is 71 years old and had worked for the county’s workforce development program for 36 years. She said she’d been forced to retire in 2019 due to a debilitating joint and muscle condition that she believes was caused by exposure to nitrates. “When Jim declared the emergency, I told him I’d been sick for the last three years, and he came out the next day and got my water tested and it was 50.9 ppm. This summer it’s up to 55.7 ppm,” she said. “If it wasn’t for these people here,” she added, referring to ORA, “and Jim Doherty exposing it all, I don’t know that we would ever have been told.”</p>
<p>Mendoza relies on a biweekly water delivery of five five-gallon jugs for cooking all her meals and to drink. Every eight weeks she goes for an infusion of drugs that calms her inflamed immune system. “How can you live with yourself knowing that the water you put in people’s houses is causing miscarriages or cancer, or God only knows how it stunts the growth of a kid? How could they do that? Then these people go out and show their faces in public. And they’re still making money with it, every time those deals get cut for new data centers.”</p>
<p>“There are so many bad actors all at once,” says Lay. “Each of these polluters bears direct responsibility for the pollution that they’re putting out there and they should be held responsible. But also, at some point, you got to blame the cop for not pulling someone over for speeding every day of their lives for the last 34 years. Every one of these agencies, from the DEQ to the Oregon Department of Agriculture, they all have regulatory authority and they haven’t used it.”</p>
<p>IN APRIL 2024, THE DEQ hit the Port of Morrow with a $727,000 fine for 880 permit violations incurred for spraying excess contaminated water over winter fields between November 2023 and February 2024. But the Port carried on with its winter application until its announcement this fall that it would suspend the practice. “There is no alternative short of closing processing plants,” Port director Lisa Mittelsdorf told a reporter last January.</p>
<p>The Port has pursued several strategies to mitigate the water crisis, including the purchase of a 5,300-acre dairy farm last year to expand its wastewater dumping. The DEQ allowed the Port to modify its permit in October 2024 to proceed with winter application on the new property, but the crop farmer who still holds a lease on the land from the previous owner had not granted the Port the permission it required to spray on the fields.</p>
<p>In December 2024, the Port gave the governor’s office a dramatic ultimatum: If the governor didn’t step in with an emergency order suspending the DEQ from levying fines for the illegal dumping of contaminated water during the winter season, the Port would stop accepting wastewater from industrial operators. Citing concerns that the move would lead to “furloughs of potentially thousands of workers resulting in substantial economic harm to the region and the State of Oregon,” the governor granted the Port’s request, allowing it to spray contaminated water without fines for a six-week period starting in January 2025. “We must balance protecting thousands of jobs in the region, the national food supply, and domestic well users during this short period of time,” Gov. Kotek explained afterward in a statement.</p>
<p>The Port is now waiting for approval of a $432 million federal grant that could allow the construction of additional wastewater storage as well as new facilities to eventually reduce wastewater nitrate levels. Meanwhile, Amazon has been paying the Port to help offset the expensive burden of its permit violations and making contributions to the community, including $850,000 to the SAGE Center, a local museum that features an Amazon learning environment called the AWS Think Big Space.</p>
<p>SINCE THE PUBLIC DECLARATION of the water emergency in 2022, a growing number of residents in Morrow County have become frustrated at a lack of accountability. The attorney general’s lawsuit was a step in the right direction, many locals feel, but it was about fiscal self-dealing, not the water that created the opportunity for those actions. In 2024, before the AG suit, investigators from the Oregon Ethics Commission recommended that Neal, Padberg, Healy, and Russell be penalized for failing to disclose their conflicts of interest while negotiating Amazon transactions on behalf of the public. The penalty for the men was $2,000 each, although that did not include Neal. Commission rules limit the scope of any inquiry to the four years prior to the investigation’s opening — which in this case stemmed from a whistleblower complaint. This meant that all but a few months of Neal’s tenure at Windwave and the Port fell outside the ethics panel’s inquiry.</p>
<p>Still, staff investigators stated that they found an October 2018 meeting discussing Amazon’s tax break deal that appeared to warrant Neal being sanctioned. It was during that meeting where “Neal may have engaged in a prohibited use of position and may have failed to disclose his conflicts of interest,” the commission investigators found in their preliminary review. In the end, however, the ethics board overruled its staff and rejected its own investigators’ findings, on the grounds that Neal didn’t substantially influence the meeting about Amazon, as they wrote in a report. Amazon and the new owners of Windwave were able to continue operating as before.</p>
<p>That could all change, however, because of an attorney in Seattle named Steve Berman. A class action specialist, Berman rose to prominence in the 1990s during the landmark big tobacco lawsuits by winning the largest single settlement of those suits ($260 billion) on behalf of a consortium of states, and more recently as the lead attorney on behalf of NCAA athletes who can now make money off their own names and likeness competing in college sports.</p>
<p>In February 2024, representing a group of six Morrow County residents, Berman filed a federal suit against the Port of Morrow, Lamb Weston, and three other large agriculture operators for their role in causing and perpetuating the region’s water crisis. Berman tells me that on Dec. 1 he will add Tillamook and Portland General Electric, a local utility, to the list of defendants. (A representative for PGE confirmed the utility received “a notice of intent to sue” and added that the water used “at its Coyote Springs plant [is] for non-contact cooling operations and does not add nitrates to the water supplied by the Port of Morrow.”) Crucially, Berman’s suit also lists unnamed John Doe defendants, which several sources close to the case believe to be a placeholder for Berman’s biggest target: Amazon.</p>
<p>On March 7, 2024, Berman and his local co-counsel, Michael Bliven, sent what’s known as an RCRA Notice, a reference to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, to Amazon. Such notices warn of a pending civil lawsuit and offer potential defendants the opportunity to remediate harm within a given timeframe. Berman and Bliven’s RCRA Notice demanded that Amazon “immediately cease all improper storage, transferring, and disposal of the hazardous industrial wastewater and to remediate the harm your company has caused” within 90 days. Berman says Amazon took no action.</p>
<p>(When asked about the RCRA Notice, Amazon referred <em>Rolling Stone</em> to its original response to this story. The company stressed in that response that its data centers do not add nitrates to the water supply and touted its job creation and an investment of “$39.2 billion in the community since 2011.”)</p>
<p>“It’s considered a basic civic right in the U.S. that the water you drink from your wells or that you get from your town should be clean and not contaminated,” Berman says. “And that right is currently being violated here.”</p>
<p>Should Berman include Amazon, it would seem to be in the company’s best interest to hammer out a pretrial settlement, if only as a strategy to contain the public relations blowback that would result from a lengthy, high-profile class action trial. Weeks of media coverage unpacking the data center public health threat would complicate matters for Amazon as it continues its aggressive rollout of new data centers in rural farming communities across the country. Amazon’s connections to Windwave only make the situation more acute: Their representatives engaged in negotiations with public officials in violation of state ethics rules while at the same time paying millions of dollars to a company whose officials are now being sued by the state attorney general.</p>
<p>A week before the Oregon attorney general filed the Windwave complaint, I heard from sources in Boardman who are close to Berman’s case. They had been told that Berman’s office was in advanced talks with Amazon to settle for $100 million before a trial begins.</p>
<p>When I spoke to Berman earlier this month, I asked him if Amazon was seeking a settlement. Berman demurred on the record, saying that he could not comment on any negotiations or discussions with current or past defendants while the case was still pending. Amazon did not respond directly to questions about a pending settlement. Should a settlement be in the final stages, the court would issue sealed orders for a federal settlement judge to oversee private hearings for the terms of the deal, a process that could take several months, at which point the court’s findings and all of the submitted evidence would be released to the public.</p>
<p>“The people whose rights are being violated don’t have a lot of power, and the people responsible for the pollution are huge mega corporations with a lot of power,” Berman says. “And they’ve been getting away with this for decades now.”</p>
<p>A LEGAL OUTCOME WOULD provide a measure of relief for Morrow County. But some damage is hard to undo.</p>
<p>Situated on 40 acres along a long, quiet blacktop road, Jim Doherty’s ranch home, where he lives with his wife, Kelly, has windows looking out to the pasture where their cattle graze. The Dohertys are in close proximity to dozens of properties with tainted wells. When I visited in November 2024, it had been more than a year since the Dohertys’ water had tested “hot,” as Jim described the contamination. Still, Kelly periodically dunks a rapid-test strip in her morning coffee just to be safe. “There’s 14 people that live on my road,” Kelly says. “I think nine of them have cancer right now.”</p>
<p>The Dohertys’ son, Bryce, lives a few miles away. He and his wife bought their land in 2018, built a new house, and drilled a well that hadn’t tested positive for nitrate contamination at the time they moved in. They were eager to start a family. But two years after moving in, they suffered a miscarriage.
