title: Every Illegal Act Trump Committed in 2025 (So Far)
---
<p>It's hard to keep track of all ofPresident Trump's criminality,illegality, and corruption. Donald Trumptook office for the second time alreadyan adjudicated felon, fraudster, andsexual assaulter. But this video isn'tabout those crimes and offenses. This isonly about what has happened so far inthe last year. Because I'll be honest,there's so much of it that it's hard toremember. And I guarantee that you'vealready forgotten half of it. So, buckleup because there's going to be a lot. Andprogramming note. Because of somequestionable acts by the Supreme Court,if something was illegal orconstitutional at the time Trump did it,we include it in the list. We start withJanuary 17th, 2025 because thecorruption of his second term startedjust before he took office. On the eveof his presidency, instead of divesting</p><p>himself of his conflict of interestridden businesses, Trump launched WorldLiberty Financial and a bunch of valuelessmeme coins. This allowed him to takebribes, engage in secret deals, andfurther enrich himself, all outside ofmany of the ordinary financialregulations. In Trump's first term,Lobbyists, foreign governments, andRepublican organizations curried favorwith Trump by spending money at hisWashington DC hotel. But this timearound, it's likely many individualsskipped the middleman and put moneydirectly in Trump's pocket by buying theassets of World Liberty Financial andits various crypto offerings. Reportsare that using World Liberty Financial,Trump has enriched himself by as much as$5 billion while in office. And it getsworse. We'll come back to that later.</p><p>Then we get to January 20th. On Trump'sfirst day in office, a flurry ofexecutive orders. Now, I'll remind you,executive orders are not law, but theycan direct federal agencies to do or notdo things where the executive hasdiscretion. In some cases, the presidenthas the power, so to speak, but the actswere illegal or corrupt. In others, thepresident had no such power at all. So,starting things out on January 20th,Trump reported to eliminate birthrightcitizenship via executive order. Thiswas a profound constitutional violation,particularly of the 14th Amendment anddue process. Trump shut down asylumrequests at the border, claiming that itIt was an invasion. This violated the INAand several other immigration-relatedstatutes, as well as a takeover clauseand separation of powers since Congresshad already created laws on this topic.</p><p>Trump reported to rename the Gulf ofMexico. Mexico sued, claiming that hedidn't have the power to rename anentire body of water, just a part in U.S.territories. Separate from the executiveorders on January 20th, Trump pardonedthe January 6th insurrectionists who hadbeen criminally convicted by juries.Now, this may technically have beenlegal since the president can pardonpeople, but as I explained at the time,it shouldn't be. Dozens of thesepeople had prior convictions or pendingcharges for crimes like rape, sexualabuse of a minor, domestic violence,manslaughter, production of child sexualabuse material, and drug trafficking.The Trump administration continues tointervene on behalf of the January 6thdefendants, and forcing pardons for thesetraitors not only undermines the rule oflaw with respect to election integrity,but sends a message that if you commit acrime, but you're on the president'steam, you'll simply not be subjectTo the same rules and laws as everybodyelse. But back to the executive orders,on January 20th, Trump terminated</p><p>federal employee telework agreements,contrary to union agreements. Trumpunilaterally withdrew from the WorldHealth Organization, which violatedinternational law. Trump sent themilitary to seal the borders. This was aviolation of posse comitatus, whichbars military engagement in civilian lawenforcement activities. Trump reinstatedthe so-called schedule F without goingthrough any notice and comment process,potentially firing federal employeeswithout going through the usual meritsystem protection process, a violationof the APA and civil serviceprotections. Trump pulled securityclearances from John Bolton and 50 otherintelligence officials. This was anunlawful First Amendment retaliation anda violation of the APA and other federalregulations regarding securityclearances. Trump unilaterally frozehiring in the government without anycongressional authorization. Trumpappointed Ed Martin to be the interim USattorney for the District of Columbia.</p><p>Martin was entirely unqualified for theHis only qualification was that hehad promoted Trump's baseless stolenelection claims. Martin went on to firemore than two dozen prosecutors who hadworked on the January 6th prosecution orthe criminal investigation of DonaldTrump, which was plainly retaliatory.</p><p>Trump unilaterally paused the TikTokban that had been passed by Congress andsigned into law. Last time I checked,the president doesn't get to decidewhich laws to implement and which notto. Trump declared a legally dubiousemergency at the southern border so heand Steven Miller could carry out theplans to deport people en masse. Thisexceeded his legal authority and set thestage for a host of other legalviolations.</p><p>Trump rolled back a varietyof energy-related regulations with noprocess in violation of the APA. He alsofroze all congressional funding toalternative energy projects in violationof the impoundments clause. Trumpsuspended the entry of refugees into thecountry in violation of the provisionsof the Immigration and Nationality Actand associated regulations.</p><p>Going back to his greatest hits, Trump directed theconstruction of a border wall withoutCongressional approval violatedthe separation of powers and the spendingclause. He terminated parole programsthat had allowed immigrants to enter thecountry in special circumstances withoutcongressional authorization or APArulemaking. Trump reestablished thefederal death penalty via executiveorder. He also directed thereconsideration of President Biden'sgrants of clemency, which is not a thingthat you can do. Stick with me because</p><p>we're only about halfway through thefirst day of the presidency on January20th. Continuing on that day, Trumpissued a memo making it easier for himto fire senior non-political leaders atgovernment agencies. This was an effortto prioritize loyalty and fidelity inviolation of civil service protectionsand probably the First Amendment. Trumpdeclared an energy emergency to getaround regulations and laws. He evenencouraged agencies to potentially usethe Defense Production Act to do this.</p><p>Trump shut down wind energy projectswithout any administrative process. Trumpfroze hundreds of billions of dollars inforeign aid. This was a violation of theImpoundment Control Act spending clause.</p><p>And separation of powers. Trump directedthe construction of detention centerswithout congressional authorization.That was also a violation of thespending clause. He unilaterallypaused funding for immigration-relatedservices and organizations, whichviolated those organizations' due processrights, separation of powers, and theempowerment control act andspending clause. Trump issued anexecutive order that authorized a travelban without specifying which countrieswould be banned. Of course, Trumpcreated or repurposed Doge, headed up byElon Musk, who had reams of conflicts ofinterest. Doge worked to illegally firefederal workers in violation of civilservice protections. Doge also illegallyaccessed sensitive personal data ofmillions of Americans, createdunauthorized information systems,illegally combined federal databases,and just generally created chaos. Atthe end of the day, contrary to thepublic releases, it saved the government andtaxpayers virtually no money. Trumpissued an executive order that strictlydefined sex and gender. The executiveorder required federal workers toGenulect to that definition, possibly in</p><p>violation of their First Amendmentrights. He unilaterally changed therules around gender designation onpassports, a possible violation of theAPA and also potentially violating dueprocess rights, especially for transindividuals. The order also frozefunding for a variety of entities thatTrump claimed were promoting the vaguelydefined gender ideology, which punishedFirst Amendment protected speech andwas obviously a usurpation ofCongress's spending powers and anunlawful impoundment. Trump frozevaguely defined DEI-related contracts,another unlawful impoundment. He alsoliquidated federal DEI offices, yankedfederal grants related to DEI, anotherunlawful impoundment, a violationof the separation of powers, and FirstAmendment violation. Trump laid thegroundwork to invoke the Alien EnemiesAct against cartels like Tren de Aragua,likely ultra vires because the act nevercontemplates the designation ofnon-state actors and criminalenterprises. Trump later used hisdesignation to deny people basic dueprocess rights and violate the processes.</p><p>Of the Immigration and Nationality Act,Trump influenced or encouraged, in the waythat the mafia encourages, the end of DEIpractices in private companies, againviolating the First Amendment rights ofprivate companies. And rounding out hisfirst day in office, Trump grantedclemency to two DC police officers whohad been convicted for unlawfullypursuing a Black scooter rider, killinghim, then trying to cover up the crime.</p><p>Of course, Trump has pardon power, sothis one probably wasn't illegal, perse, but it was still gross and negated alegitimate jury finding. That takes usto the second day in office, January21st. On that day, Trump set aside alawful verdict and issued a full pardonto Silk Road Darknet Marketplace creatorRoss Albrecht. He was the first of manyhigh-level business people to be grantedpardons or clemency by Trump, especiallythose who paid lip service to Trump orhis candidacy. Trump would go on topardon Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, NicolaCorporation founder Trevor Milton, andBitX founders Arthur Hayes, Beno, andSam Reed, among others, many of whomcontributed directly to candidate Trumpor had conflicts of interest with.</p><p>Trump's businesses. The message wasclear. If you were rich, well-connected,and corrupt enough, even criminalconvictions could be made to disappear.On January 23rd, Trump issued another 24full pardons for individuals convictedof threatening or obstructing people whowere trying to obtain or providereproductive health services. Thisoverturned lawful jury verdicts andundermined federal law, like the pardonsfor the January 6th rioters and themurderous police officers. Thisundermined the rule of law, making itclear that the only laws that matteredwere the ones that Trump agreed with. On</p><p>January 23rd, Trump’s people hamfistedlydeclassified and published recordsrelated to the JFK assassination, whichincluded social security numbers andother personally identifiableinformation of several people inviolation of privacy laws. Also onJanuary 23rd, Trump set up an illegalunauthorized, possibly unsecured serverto email all government employees enmass, which violated the e-government actand many government securityregulations and policies. On January24th, Trump fired 17 inspectors general.</p><p>You know, the people looking forcorruption, likely in violation of lawsthat created their offices andtheoretically a violation of separationof powers. On January 27th, Trump kickedtrans troops out of the military. Thislikely violated the First Amendment dueprocess and equal protection rights ofthose troops. It also likely violatedthe APA as arbitrary and capricious.</p><p>On January 28th, Trump's Doge used thepreviously discussed illegal OPM server,giving them the autonomous fork in theroad offer. Union sued, claiming theoffer violated numerous laws, includingcivil service protection, separation ofpowers, and the anti-deficiency act.</p><p>On January 28th, Trump defunded researchinto gender-affirming care for minors.And while I disagree with the SupremeCourt and think this is a due processand equal protection violation, itdefinitely was an illegal impoundment ofcongressional funds. On January 29th,Trump tried to keep teachers and schoolsfrom discussing a long list of ideas,concepts, and terms, violating theirFirst Amendment due process rights. Hepulled federal funds from schools thatdidn't comply, violating the spendingClause, the Empowerment Control Act, and theFirst Amendment. On January 31st, Trumpworked to systematically destroycollective bargaining agreements forfederal employees. This violatedstatutory collective bargaining rights,exceeded legal authority, andviolated the APA.</p><p>Now, 200 news outletsreported on the terrorist organizationdesignation, but depending on thesources you follow, it's hard to tell ifthey were even talking about the sameevent. When you scroll down to see howthe story is being covered by everyoutlet, the frames can have a subtledifference that makes a huge impact. Thebulk of the reporting from the centergot it right. Cartel Deas Solas is not areal drug cartel, implying the legalityconcerns about the designation.</p><p>In contrast, reporting from the rightacknowledged that the designation was anallegation, but then focused on whatmight come next, implying legalvalidity. And on the left, headlinescommonly use the future tense, implyingthat the designation hasn't happenedyet, and thus legal questions remainopen for challenge.</p><p>Now, this type ofanalysis is why Ground News has been myMy favorite way to stay up to date with thenews since 2023.

Now,let's get back to February of this year.</p><p>On February 1st, Trump issued his firstexecutive orders on tariffs againstMexico, Canada, and China. These wouldbe the first of many. He has continuedto go back and forth on tariffs eversince. Trump's tariffs violated a numberof international treaties, including theUSMCA, which he himself negotiated, thenewer version of NAFTA. It violatedconstitutional separation of powers, theAPA and also exceeded his legalauthority. On February 5th, Trump issuedan executive order excluding trans womenfrom women's sports and pulling fundingfrom schools that did not comply. Onthat same day, Pam Bonnie was sworn inas Trump's attorney general. She</p><p>wasted no time and issued a flurry ofmemos, including one that would rollback enforcement of the Foreign AgentsRegistration Act, or FAR, a lawfullypassed congressional act. Again, thepresident cannot choose just not toenforce certain laws, which violates theTake Care clause. On February 6th, Trumpdirected agencies to pull funding fromNPOs that he didn't like. Trump alsothreatened financial and travelpenalties against anyone involved in theInternational Criminal Courtinvestigations into US citizens. OnFebruary 10th, Trump pardoned disgracedformer Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich.</p><p>Blagojevich had been lawfully convicted ofcorruption. This was the first of manycorrupt politicians that Trump wouldpardon. Trump also eliminated theFederal Executive Institute withoutcongressional authorization. And Trumpunilaterally paused enforcement of theThe Foreign Corrupt Practices Act is ananti-bribery law that prohibitscompanies and individuals from payingforeign officials to gain businessadvantages. It's super weird how theTrump administration just chose not toenforce myriad different corruption lawsand seemingly only corruption laws. OnFebruary 10th, Trump imposed a25% tariff on steel. Like his othertariffs, he does not have thisauthority. On February 11th, Trumpstarted broad, unjustified firings acrossthe government. He gave Doge authorityto fire and said that new hires couldonly be brought on with Doge approval.</p><p>This violated the Empowerment ControlAct, spending clauses, and plenty ofunion agreements and civil serviceprotections. On that same day, inretaliation for the media company'srefusal to use the ridiculous Gulf ofAmerica title, Trump banned theAssociated Press from the White Housepress pool. This violated their firstamendment rights. Trump also imposed aunilateral 25% tariff on aluminum. OnFebruary 13th, Trump's OMB directedagencies to draw up plans to startfiring federal employees en masse, layingOff entire departments, and</p><p>strong-arming remaining employees toleave. This violated civil serviceprotections, but it also didn’t matterbecause at the same time, he also pushedout the heads of the independentagencies, the Merit Systems ProtectionBoard, and Office of Special Counsel, whowould have been able to adjudicate thoseemployees' claims. The Supreme Court hasnow likely countenanced all of thisactivity, but at the time it violatedexisting law. On February 13th, Trumppushed out Danielle Sassoon, acting U.S.</p><p>attorney for the Southern District ofNew York, and Assistant U.S. AttorneyHagen Scotton, as well as several othersbecause they refused to drop briberycharges against New York City Mayor EricAdams. Trump replaced them with someonemore agreeably corrupt, and in April,the charges against Adams were dropped.It was clear that in exchange for thismercy, Adams agreed to cooperate withTrump's ICE enforcers. On February 15th,Trump ordered his Department ofEducation to begin investigating how topull funds from schools with COVIDvaccine mandates. This would potentiallybe a violation of the 10th Amendment.</p><p>The Empowerment Control Act andthe separation of powers. On February 18th,Trump seized control of all agencies,including independent agencies, forcingthem to conform to his and PamBonnie's interpretation of law. OnFebruary 18th, Trump's DOJ stoppeddefending EPA rules that the agency knewwould save lives. This was likelyarbitrary and capricious. On February19th, Trump froze funding for sanctuaryjurisdictions and any grants that giveaid to undocumented immigrants, aviolation of the spending clause andempowerment. On February 19th, Trumpshuttered entire agencies, including theInstitute of Peace with a stroke of thepen. This violated the spending clause,the separation of powers, and theEmpowerment Control Act, and likelyexceeded the president's authority. OnFebruary 25th, Trump went on a revengetour against law firms that he felt hadwronged him, pulling their securityclearances and trying to pull theirgovernment contracts. This wasretaliation for First Amendmentprotected speech as well as a dueprocess violation. On February 26th,Trump directed all federal agencies toReview grants, contracts, and loans andbegan freezing anything deemed inefficient. On March 1st, Trump opened</p><p>up federal lands for timber harvestingand contravened environmental lawsin the APA. On March 5th, Trump's DOJappointees began more aggressivelyinvestigating the University ofCalifornia system for supposedanti-Semitism, and the administrationbegan threatening grants and funding,often in retaliation for First Amendmentprotected speech. On March 6th, Trumpcontinued his revenge tour against enemylaw firms, yanking clearances ingovernment contracts. Again, this was inretaliation for First Amendmentprotected speech. It was a due processviolation. On March 7th, Trump made itmore difficult for employees in publicinterest fields to get student loanforgiveness; the government had promisedthem, a violation of their due processand First Amendment rights. On March7th, Trump DOJ leadership terminatedpardon attorney Liz Oyer because sherecommended against restoring gun rightsto actor Mel Gibson. This wasretaliatory in violation of civilservice protections. On March 8th,Trump's DHS abducted and detained greencard holder Mammud Khalil in retaliationfor his First Amendment protected speechregarding the Israel-Palestine conflict.</p><p>This was part of a larger pattern ofdetentions and illegal retaliationagainst student protesters, includingRomea Ozurk and numerous others. OnMarch 11th, Trump largely strippedauthority from the public integrity unitof DOJ, making it impossible toprosecute corruption crimes, which ispretty convenient for him and hisfriends because it cleared the way for alot more illegal acts. It was alsoprobably a violation of the impoundmentsact. Also on March 11th, in a signalchat with Atlantic editor JeffreyGoldberg, Secretary of Defense PeteHegsath shared confidential and evenclassified information about impendingmilitary actions. Hexath apparentlyaccidentally added Goldberg to theSignal chat with pretty much every otherUS national security leader. Holdingthese conversations over Signal, evenwithout a journalist present, was aviolation of federal records laws, theEspionage Act, and probably severalother national security related laws.</p><p>It was also really dumb, and no one hasbeen punished for this act. On March11th, Trump pardoned former RepublicanTennessee State Senator Brian Kelce, whohad been found guilty of violatingcampaign finance laws. This set aside alawful criminal conviction. On March14th, Trump managed to push out anotherassistant US attorney. This time it wasShawn Murphy, who had prosecuted theJanuary 6th insurrectionist. Murphyissued a resignation letter remindinghis colleagues that quote, "You serve noman." Murphy reported that after Trumppardoned the insurrectionist, they hadthreatened and harassed Murphy. Also onMarch 14th, Trump continued his revengeagainst law firms, this time againstthe firm Paul Weiss. Again, this was stillsuper legal because it was retaliationagainst First Amendment protectedactivity. The same day, Trumpunilaterally shuttered even more federalagencies. Again, a violation of thespending clause, separation of powers, andthe Empowerment Control Act. Trump beganhis campaign to coerce universities intodoing his bidding. First, he hitColumbia University with a list ofdemands and a threat that funding wouldBe pulled. Later, he moved on to</p><p>Cornell, Harvard, Johns Hopkins, and along list of others. This violated theirFirst Amendment rights, succeeded thepresident's authority, and violated thespending clause, often because Trumptied compliance with funding. OnFebruary 15th, Trump invoked the AlienEnemies Act to go after a Venezuelangang, Tren dear. This exceeded hisauthority in the language of thestatute. Trump also used his designationto deny people basic due process rightsand violated the Immigration andNationality Act. On March 15th, Trump'sICE agents detained Kilmargo Garcia andshipped him off to a torture prison inEl Salvador along with plane loads ofother people who had never been givenany due process rights. This violatedthe Immigration and Nationality Act, dueprocess and international laws againsttorture. When federal judge JebBooseberg demanded that the Trumpadministration bring Abrego Garcia backand give him some due process, Trump'sagencies openly flouted the law and theruling. Booseberg then found probablecause and held the Trump administrationin contempt for violating his orders.</p><p>These contempt proceedings are stillgoing on. On March 18th, Trump continuedhis war on independent offices, firingtwo FTC commissioners, violating the FTCAct and the Separation of Powers, thoughthe Supreme Court now disagrees. OnMarch 19th, Trump continued his waragainst the vaguely defined DEI. Thistime banning any words or ideas he likedfrom foreign service. This is likely aFirst Amendment violation. On March20th, Trump unilaterally shuttered theDepartment of Education. This was amajor violation of the spending clause,Separation of Powers, the EmpowermentControl Act, and exceeded thepresident's authority. On March 20th,Trump proposed suitability regulationsfor federal employees that would allowthe government to fire or not hireemployees for vague reasons. Inpractice, this has turned into a loyaltytest to the president, which violates</p><p>the First Amendment due process andcivil service protections. On March20th, Trump commanded agencies tocombine vast databases full of sensitivepersonal information and demolish legalprotections that safeguard privacy. OnMarch 21st, Trump began shutting downCivil rights and civil libertiesoversight offices at DHS. On March22nd, Trump continued his revengeagainst his political enemies by pullingsecurity clearances from Joe Biden, KamalaHarris, Hillary Clinton, Liz Cheney,and a long list of others. As usual,this was retaliation for their FirstAmendment rights. On March 22nd, morerevenge. Trump told his attorney generalto pursue sanctions against lawyers orfirms that were mean to him. Not upanother violation of the First Amendmentand due process.</p><p>On March 24th, moretariffs. Trump instituted a 25% tariffon any country that traded forVenezuelan oil. This is the sameviolation as the last ones. On March25th, Trump attempted to seize broadcontrol over elections, changing voterregistration requirements and formsdespite the fact that he actually has noauthority over state elections. He onceagain threatened to pull federal fundsfrom any state that dared defy him. OnMarch 25th, Trump's administrationchanged a rule regarding unaccompaniedminors, with no notice and commentrulemaking process, making it moredifficult for unaccompanied minors to getSponsored and leave detentionfacilities. On March 25th and 27th, morerevenge, this time against law firmsJenner and Block and Wilmer Hale.</p><p>Different law firms, same legalviolations by Trump. On March 26th,Trump pardoned Hunter Biden associateand fraudster Deon Archer, overturning alawful criminal conviction for yetanother corrupt figure, one who castdispersions against the Bidens. On March27th, Trump tried to rewrite history,strongarming the Smithsonian, NationalParks, and other public institutions toignore the uglier parts of Americanhistory and instead focus exclusively onAmerican greatness. This probablyviolates the First Amendment rights ofthe park rangers and employees of themuseums, who are no longer allowed totell the truth about the gruesomeness ofslavery, the injustice of Japaneseinternment camps, or any other of the</p><p>worst parts of American history. OnMarch 27th, Trump shredded unionagreements and barred employees fromcollective bargaining. On March 30th, inpublic interviews, Trump begins refusingto rule out running for a third term,despite the fact that it would beBlatantly unconstitutional. He'llcontinue to flirt with this over thecoming months. On April 2nd, Trump setmore tariffs, lots and lots of legaltariffs for pretty much every singlecountry in the world. As usual, thepresident doesn't have the power to settariffs, and it violated the separationof powers, the laws regarding tariffs,and uncountable international treaties.</p><p>On April 3rd, Alina Haba, Trump's actingUS attorney for New Jersey, asked todismiss a case against two Americanexecutives charged with authorizing $2million in bribes to obtain aconstruction permit in India. Thisignores the Foreign Corrupt PracticesAct, which is in keeping with Trump'sdisdain for that law. And it turns outthat Haba was illegally appointed tothat position.</p><p>On April 4th, Trump onceagain unilaterally set aside the lawthat Congress passed, barring Tik Tok,still a violation. On April 6th, Trump'sDOJ fired career attorney Arezz Ruveniafter he refused to lie for theadministration in court over itstreatment of Kilbar and Grego Garcia.</p><p>On April 8th, Trump tried to unilaterallynegate state environmental laws.</p><p>Threatening to sue states and preempttheir laws and withhold federal energyfunding from those that don't back down.On April 8th, Trump unilaterallyderegulated coal and explored coalmining on federal lands in violation ofexisting laws in the APA. On April 9th,Trump went after law firm SusmanGodfrey, another enemy law firm, andChris Krebs, who dared to contradictTrump's made-up election fraud claims, aswell as former Trump administrationemployee Miles Tyler. This was just asillegal as all the other times he triedto do this. On April 10th, the BBCreported that the Trump administration</p><p>had revoked hundreds of foreign studentvisas over First Amendment protectedactivity, which is unlawful retaliationunder the Constitution. On April 11th,Trump sent the military to the southernborder, possibly in violation of possecomitatus. On April 16th, Trumpthreatened to weaponize the IRS torevoke Harvard's tax-exempt status, aviolation of federal tax law and dueprocess and exceeded the president'sauthority. On April 17th, Trump reopenedparts of a marine national monument tocommercial fishing in potential.</p><p>Violations of several environmental lawsin the APA. On April 23rd, Trumpdemanded that the Secretary of Educationand Attorney General go after highereducation creditors who promote DEIgoals. This is again a violation of theFirst Amendment and due process. OnApril 24th, Trump pushed the federalgovernment to more aggressively explore,permit, and develop deep sea and seabedmineral resources both off the US coastand potentially in areas beyond nationaljurisdiction. On April 24th, Trumpsingled out Act Blue, a Democraticfundraising platform, by name in anexecutive order calling for the AttorneyGeneral to go after straw donors. Trumphas gone after Act Blue several times,which is likely retaliation for FirstAmendment speech, viewpointdiscrimination, and violations of thedue process and equal protectionclauses. On April 24th, Trumpunilaterally repealed several civilservice rules related to probationaryperiods. On April 25th, the Trumpadministration arrested Milwaukee JudgeHannah Dugan because she led a criminaldefendant out the back door instead ofout the front door, which led him to a</p><p>The hallway took him right back to themain hallway where ICE picked him up. OnApril 25th, under the direction ofTrump's Doge, Americanore tried tocancel $400 million in grants with noprocess. On April 28th, Trump yankedfunds for sanctuary cities, a violationof the spending clause and the empowermentcontrol act. On May 1st, Trumpunilaterally pulled federal funding fromNPR and PBS. On May 9th, Trump tried torescind water pressure regulationswithout going through any of therequired notice and rulemaking. On May19th, the Trump administration announcedplans to begin weaponizing the FalseClaims Act to claim that DEI spendingwas somehow a criminal waste of taxdollars. On May 21st, Trump's JusticeDepartment abandoned its consent decreewith Minneapolis that was meant toaddress racially discriminatorypolicing. The DOJ refused to stand bythe factual findings about police abusesin Minneapolis and five other cities,retracting them from the record andpotentially allowing discrimination andpolice violence to continue withoutaccountability.</p><p>On May 21st, another federal judge found that the TrumpThe administration had violated a courtorder by deporting immigrants to thirdparty countries without giving them dueprocess. US District Judge Brian Murphydeclared that quote, "The department'sactions in this case are unquestionablyviolative of this court's order." On May21st, Trump accepted a $400 million jetas a gift from Qatar, which he is earto use after he leaves office, whichsure sounds like a law-breaking bribe.</p><p>On May 23rd, Trump rewarded the peoplewho made the biggest bribes, I mean,investments in his meme coin with alavish dinner at Mar-a-Lago. It wasoriginally supposed to be at the WhiteHouse and promised a personal visit fromthe president; just more corruption andethics law violations. On May 28th,Trump pardoned a few more corrupt formerpoliticians. This time, it was MichaelGrimm from New York, who had beenconvicted of felony tax fraud, and JohnRoland from Connecticut, who had alsobeen convicted of corruption.</p><p>On June 4th, Trump unilaterally created a travelban for nine countries. Also, on June4th, Trump just shut down foreignstudent visas. Often the denials weretied to pro-Palestinian speech, which isFirst Amendment protected activity. OnJune 7th, Trump illegally mobilized theNational Guard to help ICE in itsimmigration enforcement actions. Hestarted in California in June, moved toDC in August, then Memphis, Chicago,Portland, and North Carolina. Thisviolated the Posse Comitatus Act,exceeded the president's authority underSection 12406, and violated the 10thAmendment. Trump made the deployment inCalifornia doubly illegal by alsodeploying the active Marines. On June13th, Trump's law enforcement agentsdragged California Senator Alex Padillaout of a press conference. Also on June14th, Trump threw himself a veryexpensive birthday party, $25 to $40million expensive. And that was $25 to$40 million that Congress neverallocated for that purpose. On June17th, Trump's law enforcement agentscontinued their assault on Democraticlegislators and politicians, arresting</p><p>Brad Lander, the New York Citycomptroller at a protest in violation ofhis First Amendment rights. Theadministration would go on to arrestpastors, judges, and pretty much anyoneelse who objected to ICE's increasinglyAggressive tactics. On June 19th, Trumpcontinued to delay faithfully carryingout Congress's TikTok ban. Same action,same violations. On July 9th, Trump'sDOJ subpoenaed more than 20 doctors andhospitals that provide gender-relatedcare to minors. The subpoenas likelyviolated privacy laws by demandingpatient information. On July 11th,Trump's Attorney General, Pam Bondi,fired another 20 prosecutors and supportstaff who worked with Jack Smith toinvestigate Trump. This was clearlyretaliatory and violated civil servicelaws. On July 17th, Trump unilaterallyamended civil service regulations withno notice in common rulemaking, makingit easier to fire federal employees fornot genuflecting to him. On July 17th,Senator Rob Widen publicly accused Trumpof refusing to enforce the law andinvestigate Epstein's financial ties.</p><p>Trump denied this but killed thefinancial investigation and mysteriouslycontinued to withhold the Epstein files.</p><p>Under fire for handling of the Epsteincase, Pam Bondi has now reversed courseon investigating the banks. On July17th, Trump fired James Comey'sdaughter, Moren Comey. This was anAn obviously retaliatory and politicallymotivated act. She later sued, claimingthis was both unlawful andunconstitutional. On July 23rd, Trump'sdirector of national intelligence, TulsiGabbard, accused former President Obamaof treason. This had no legal backingwhatsoever and would be a retaliatorypotential prosecution of a politicalenemy. On July 24th, Trump ordered theclearing of homeless camps andconditioned federal funding on citiesdoing his bidding to institutionalize</p><p>and clear people. This violated statesrights in the 10th amendment. Civilcommitment procedures and local publicsafety laws are primarily governed bythe state, not federal law. The federalgovernment cannot compel states toexpand their laws or amend theirspecific criteria for involuntarytreatment. On July 30th, despite ormaybe because of his prior unethical andcorrupt actions, Emil Boie, Trump's pickfor an appeals court judicial position,is confirmed. Boie had defended Trump inthree criminal trials and had reportedlytold his employees to disregard courtorders. On July 30th, Trump continued tomonkey with tariffs, eliminating.</p><p>Dimminimous duty-free provisions withoutcongressional approval. On July 31st,Trump continued to mess around withtariff rates that he was not allowed toinstitute in the first place. Still,legal for all the reasons that wepreviously said. On April 6th, thebribes continued. This time it was aplaque from Apple with a 24-karat goldcase. This joined a long list of othergolden bribes, including a world boxingchampionship belt from Zilinski, agolden pager from Netanyahu, and agolden helmet from Japanese PrimeMinister Sheibba, a portrait from Putin,and a gold crown from South KoreanPresident Lee, and of course, the Qatarijet. For ethics-related reasons, noordinary government employee couldaccept any of these gifts, but thejury is still out on ethics rules and emolumentsto the president.</p><p>On August 11th, Trumptried to take over the DC policedepartment. The court quickly struckthat down because it was a violation ofthe Home Rule Act and exceeded hispresidential power. On August 14th,Trump's Border Patrol chief, GregBevino, showed up with a group ofwell-armed Border Patrol agents outside.</p><p>Of Governor Newsom's rally in what LAMayor Karen Bass called a provocativeact, and lawyers might call retaliationor intimidation that chills FirstAmendment protected speech. On August27th, in what is likely a politicallymotivated investigation, Trump's FBIsearched John Bolton's house. On August25th, Trump tried to make it illegal toburn the American flag. Too bad theSupreme Court has already ruled on thisand prosecuting it would be a FirstAmendment violation. On August 25th,Trump tried to fire Lisa Cook from theFederal Reserve Board. Theadministration falsely accused her ofmortgage fraud to try and come up with afalse cause for firing. On August 28th,</p><p>Trump continued his vendetta againstfederal unions, barring more employeesfrom collective bargaining. On September2nd, Trump ordered the killing of 11people in a boat off the coast ofVenezuela. He claimed they were drugdealers, but there was never a trial orany kind of due process, nor any kind ofcongressional authorization, which is amassive constitutional violation, andalso murder. On September 8th, theSupreme Court signs off on racialProfiling by ICE in the shadow docket,which sets the stage for ICE to continueusing what are colloquially calledKavanaugh stops, where ICE detains UScitizens without probable cause.</p><p>Generally, these are stops based on aperson's race or use of the Spanishlanguage. The Supreme Court has not yetweighed in on the merits of thisdecision, and it is likely a due processviolation and a violation of the FourthAmendment. On September 15th, Trumplaunched a campaign to pressure networksto cancel comedians and commentators andcommanded FCC chairman Brennan Carr tofire them. Beginning with Jimmy Kimmeland later moving on to Al Sharpton,this is clearly retaliation for First Amendmentspeech. On September 15th, Trump decidedto send the National Guard into Memphis.</p><p>Though the governor approved, this wouldstill likely be a violation of PosseComitatus. A state court judge foundthat the deployment violated theTennessee Constitution. On September19th, Trump added an illegal andunjustified $100,000 fee onto all H-1Bvisa applications. On September 20th, ina clear First Amendment violation,Secretary of Defense Hegsth requiredMembers of the press were asked to sign a newpledge. The pledge banned journalistsfrom reporting on anything that Hegsthhadn't signed off on. Anyone who didn'tsign it would be out of the DoD presspool. Only 15 reporters signed, and evenFox News and Newsmax opted out.</p><p>Hegsathth announced an entirely new,more compliant and right-wing press poolin October. On September 20th, afterTrump said publicly, "I want him out."Eric Sebert, the US attorney for theEastern District of Virginia, resigned.He'd refused to go along with the Trumpadministration's politically motivatedwitch hunts against James Comey andLeticia James, among others. This wasobviously corrupt and retaliatory. OnSeptember 22nd, Trump designated Antifaas a domestic terrorist organization,which is impossible because there's nosuch thing under American law. OnSeptember 22nd, numerous media reportsclaimed that the Trump borders a Tom H.Homeman had accepted $50,000 in cash ina cava bag in exchange for plumgovernment contracts. Hman denied he didanything illegal, but did not denytaking the bag of cash. And the Trumpadministration spiked the investigation.</p><p>Into Hman's bribery, Trump issued a newexecutive order pertaining to domesticterrorism, specifically referencing themurder of Charlie Kirk. The orderdirects Bonnie to establish a task forcethat would prosecute NOS's and Americancitizens under the Foreign CorruptPractices Act. The order createdconfusion about whether the FCPA, whichwas illegally paused, is now unpaused.And the order illegally targets Trump'spolitical enemies for prosecution. OnSeptember 25th, Trump's lawyers issued aretaliatory indictment against hispolitical enemy, Jim Comey. Prosecutorshad previously declined to engage in</p><p>this prosecution, so Trump just firedthem and found someone less competent,Lindsey Hallagan. Trump is also tryingto go after New York Attorney GeneralLeticia James, Adam Schiff, and JohnBrennan. On September 30th, during thegovernment shutdown, Trump's OMinstructed employees to put politicallyinflammatory partisan messages out astheir out-of-office messages during theshutdown. When employees didn't do that,some agencies changed the employees' outof office messages without permission.This was compelled speech in violation.</p><p>Of the First Amendment and violation ofthe Hatch Act. It also violated theAnti-Deficiency Act, as were the partisanbanners put up on federalwebsites during the shutdown. OnSeptember 27th, Trump declared that hewas sending troops to Portland; again, aviolation of Posse Comitatus andexceeded Trump's authority under section12406. On October 6th, Trump sent theNational Guard to Chicago against thewishes of the Illinois governor.Different jurisdiction, same violation.On October 11th, Lindsay Halligan,Trump's loyalist, who was handpicked toprosecute James Comey, sent anunexpected Signal chat to legaljournalist and legal eagle contributorAnna Bower. In between chastising Annafor her reporting, Lindsay teasedinformation about the grand juryproceedings against Comey, which is abizarre departure from the usual rulesof prosecutorial decorum as well as thefederal rules of criminal procedure.Additionally, the use of Signal withautodeleted chats was a violation offederal records laws. On October 15th,Trump's team planned an IRS overhaul topursue left-leaning groups, clearly aViolation of First Amendment rights. On</p><p>October 16th, Trump used research anddevelopment money to pay the militarydespite the fact that the government wasshut down. This violated theConstitution and the Anti-DeficiencyAct. On October 17th, Trump commuted thesentence of the world's most prolificliar, former Republican USrepresentative from New York, GeorgeSantos. On October 21st, reports arethat Trump tried to force the DOJ to payhim $230 million for his prosecution ofhis illegal acts. This seems like anobvious conflict of interest and ethicalviolation. And if his minions in the DOJapproved this, it would also be welloutside the usual bounds of the FederalTOR Claims Act. On October 23rd, Trumpexpanded his murderous strikes tonon-adjudicated drug traffickers andcivilians on a vessel in the Pacific,killing five people. Murder is stillillegal. On October 23rd, Trumpillegally ripped down the historic EastWing of the White House. Trump alsoillegally accepted gifts to help fundthis act of vandalism. The funds to doany work on the East Wing have not beenapproved by Congress, another violation.</p><p>Of the Anti-Deficiency Act. On October23rd, Trump's DOJ indicted Democraticcongressional candidate Kate Abu for herinvolvement in a protest at a federalimmigration facility outside of Chicago.On October 24th, Trump accepted ananonymous $130 million donation tocircumvent Congress's governmentshutdown. This is another violation ofthe Anti-Deficiency Act. On October24th, Trump killed six more people inanother boat strike in the Caribbean.This was his 10th strike. He's up toabout 64 people now, but murder is stilllegal. On October 25th, Trump appearedto be starting a war with Venezuelawithout any congressional authorization.On October 25th, Trump declared thathe's going to send his people to monitorelections in California and New Jersey,which sure looks like unlawful voterintimidation. On October 28th, moreretaliatory actions at the DOJ. Thistime, Trump's DOJ put two prosecutors onadministrative leave because they haddared to mention in a memo that a guywho threatened former President Obamahad reposted one of Trump's truth social</p><p>posts, which had Obama's address. OnOctober 31st, the Trump administrationTrump published a rule limiting publicinterest student loan forgiveness foranyone it decided was working forpolitical enemies. On November 3rd,Trump sat down for an interview with 60Minutes, which was then heavily edited,likely at his request, and probablybecause he filed a First Amendmentviolating lawsuit against the networklast year for releasing an editedinterview with Kla Harris because theyhad edited it. On November 4th, Trumpsaid he planned to ignore a judge'sorder that his administration pay outSNAP benefits during the governmentshutdown, which would be contempt ofcourt. On November 4th, Trump was suedfor months of inhumane conditions at theICE facility in Illinois. Theseconditions have been repeatedly noted byjudges and advocates across the country,and violate due process in the EighthAmendment prohibition against cruel andunusual punishment. On November 10th,Trump continued pardoning his buddies.</p><p>This time, it was Rudy Giuliani andothers accused of plotting to overturnthe 2020 election. On November 16th,there was another strike by the Trumpadministration, this time in the EasternPacific. The estimated murder count nowstands at 83. On November 17th, Trumpthreatens to launch strikes againstMexico. Again, Congress has not approvedany wars.

Federalauthorities were chastised for seizingTate and his brother's electronicdevices and told to return the devicesto the suspects. On November 18th, Trumpthreatens ABC's broadcast license afteran ABC reporter dares to ask Trump abouthis ties to Jeffrey Epstein. On November19th, news breaks that apparentlyLindseay Halagan and the Trump DOJ neveractually presented the Comey indictment.</p><p>To the grand jury, they apparently can'teven do politically motivatedprosecutions. Right. On November 20th,Democratic lawmakers who were members ofthe military and intelligence communitymade a commercial telling servicemembers they have a duty to defy illegalorders. In response, Trump made a seriesof threatening posts on Truth Social,calling for Democratic lawmakers to bepunished with death for seditiousconduct. These are the kinds ofstatements that would get anyone elsearrested or at least investigated forterroristic threats or assault. Butgiven presidential immunity, I guess it</p><p>just doesn’t matter. Trump said thesemembers of Congress should be killed. Heposted seditious behavior punishable bydeath. The Pentagon then launched aretaliatory investigation into SenatorMark Kelly. So, there you have it. Thoseare all the crimes or arguable crimes,illegal conduct, and corrupt acts thatwe could put together. I’m sure wemissed some. If we did, please let usknow. We'll update the list and probablydo this at least every year, and the nextthree years are going to be a rough ridefor the rule of law.</p><p>These acts have been ratified by theSupreme Court, and I'm sure that otherswill be in the future.
