(Emilio Madrid)</figcaption></figure><p>I am told that writers used to be interesting. For a brief, golden period, they called each other names, fell out bitterly and publicly with members of rival circles, left husbands and wives for other husbands and wives who were summarily abandoned in turn, and gleefully alienated editors or reviewers whom it would have been far more strategic to impress. Sometimes, they even came to blows. In 1968, Gore Vidal goaded William F. Buckley Jr. into threatening to punch him on live television; three years later, Norman Mailer headbutted Vidal as recompense for a negative review. The writing that all this turmoil produced was, for the most part, seething with extravagant incaution.</p><p>Things have wilted considerably in the intervening decades. These days, few would risk the PR disaster of a public meltdown or a televised brawl, and no one dares to upend an established career by falling disastrously and derangingly in love.</p><p class="rw-outer-content"><span>Some content could not be imported from the original document.</span> <a href="https://washingtonpost.com/books/2025/12/02/olivia-nuzzi-american-canto-memoir-review/">View content ↗ </a></p><p class="rw-outer-content"><span>Some content could not be imported from the original document.</span> <a href="https://washingtonpost.com/books/2025/12/02/olivia-nuzzi-american-canto-memoir-review/">View content ↗ </a></p><p class="rw-outer-content"><span>Some content could not be imported from the original document.</span> <a href="https://washingtonpost.com/books/2025/12/02/olivia-nuzzi-american-canto-memoir-review/">View content ↗ </a></p><p>No one, that is, except Olivia Nuzzi. Until last fall, Nuzzi was a flashy political reporter at New York magazine. Together with her fiancé, Ryan Lizza, who worked as chief Washington correspondent at Politico until earlier this year, she cut a dazzling figure around town. Her pieces made the rounds not because she broke stories or divulged secrets but because she wrote obtrusively, with what is sometimes called “a voice.” She was the kind of standout whom tabloids describe as “a star journalist” if disaster strikes — as it tends to do, and as it did in a big way in Nuzzi’s case.</p><p class="rw-outer-content"><span>Some content could not be imported from the original document.</span> <a href="https://washingtonpost.com/books/2025/12/02/olivia-nuzzi-american-canto-memoir-review/">View content ↗ </a></p><p>As of two months ago, Nuzzi is the West Coast editor of Vanity Fair, but for a year she was persona non grata, an exile in Los Angeles, where she was apparently writing a digressive book in the Notes app on her phone. The reason was Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the rasping vaccine skeptic who now serves as secretary of health and human services and who once hosted (and may still host) a parasitic worm in his brain. In the fall of 2024, explosive news broke: It seemed that Nuzzi and this strange specimen were <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/media/2024/09/20/olivia-nuzzi-rfk-jr-robert-kennedy-relationship/" target="_blank">enmeshed in a torrid romantic entanglement</a>. The full extent of the affair is anyone’s guess — both parties claim it was never physical, leaving rubberneckers like me to wonder what in the world it was — but it launched a scandal regardless. In October 2024, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/media/2024/10/21/olivia-nuzzi-new-york-magazine-rfk-jr-lizza-review/" target="_blank">Nuzzi and New York magazine parted ways.</a> So, it seems, did Nuzzi and Kennedy. Lizza was left to fade into obscurity, at least until he recently clawed his way back to relevance by accusing Nuzzi of sleeping with former South Carolina governor Mark Sanford and other questionable behavior in an irresistibly tawdry <a href="https://substack.com/home/post/p-179131046" target="_blank">series of Substack posts</a>.</p><p class="rw-outer-content"><span>Some content could not be imported from the original document.</span> <a href="https://washingtonpost.com/books/2025/12/02/olivia-nuzzi-american-canto-memoir-review/">View content ↗ </a></p><p>Ethically speaking, Nuzzi’s journalistic breach was grave: She had compromised her reporting by becoming intimately involved with a subject and a source. But as a piece of human drama, her lapse was gripping. In the hands of a writer willing to submit to the harsh discipline of humiliation, a crisis can be an opportunity — not for anything as facile and self-serving as PR rehabilitation but for a reckoning with our depths and depravities. And was this ever a crisis! Was it ever depraved! Has it yielded a commensurate masterpiece?</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/Q7VIHKBKWNE2BBLQ6EC7HN7H3I.jpg"/><figcaption>(Avid Reader)</figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://amzn.to/4oVelgu" target="_blank">“American Canto,”</a> Nuzzi’s much-anticipated attempt to write her way out of a reputational pit, is a scramble of fragments. Many of them are about the larger-than-life gaucherie of the Trump era, which Nuzzi has been covering with flair since it began; some are about manta rays, microplastics and other phenomena that she vaguely positions as symbolically potent; still others are quotations from sources as varied as Leonard Cohen and Carl Jung. And of course, there is plenty of coloratura about Nuzzi’s present situation — which, while she was writing, appears to have involved languishing on various modest hikes around Los Angeles as the wildfires bore down on the city. “The Politician,” as she refers to Kennedy throughout, makes only brief appearances, often in sections that are so elliptical that anyone who was not already familiar with the story would find them unintelligible. “Like all men but more so, he was a hunter,” she bafflingly writes. “In a literal sense, he used not a bullet but a bird” — a line that would be incomprehensible to anyone who did not know that Kennedy is a dedicated falconer, and that remains somewhat incomprehensible to me.</p><p class="rw-outer-content"><span>Some content could not be imported from the original document.</span> <a href="https://washingtonpost.com/books/2025/12/02/olivia-nuzzi-american-canto-memoir-review/">View content ↗ </a></p><p class="rw-outer-content"><span>Some content could not be imported from the original document.</span> <a href="https://washingtonpost.com/books/2025/12/02/olivia-nuzzi-american-canto-memoir-review/">View content ↗ </a></p><p class="rw-outer-content"><span>Some content could not be imported from the original document.</span> <a href="https://washingtonpost.com/books/2025/12/02/olivia-nuzzi-american-canto-memoir-review/">View content ↗ </a></p><p>A public hungry for scandal might be more<b> </b>satisfied if “American Canto” were uniformly excellent or uniformly terrible. But in our unsatisfying reality, it is what most debut books are: highly uneven and largely forgettable. To be sure, vast swaths of it are impressively and aggressively awful. When Nuzzi is trying to sound literary, as she often is, her syntax is tortured and halting: “I have only a flight instinct, and reporting, I never had to consider it until now, is a way of fleeing yourself.” Sometimes, the resulting garble has an almost Trumpian cadence: “From the front porch I heard laughter. It was 3 a.m. I moved my ear to the window. Laughter, I was certain. Three a.m.”</p><p class="rw-outer-content"><span>Some content could not be imported from the original document.</span> <a href="https://washingtonpost.com/books/2025/12/02/olivia-nuzzi-american-canto-memoir-review/">View content ↗ </a></p><p>But at its worst, Nuzzi’s prose is not just stilted or repetitive. It is ostentatiously mannered, itching at every turn to announce its showy lyricism. It reads like a Joan Didion pastiche — but it is worried and overworked in a way that Didion, a master of taut precision, would never have countenanced. “I mean to tell you of the canyon where voices carried. The place where monsters spoke to me,” Nuzzi writes. Why doesn’t she just tell us, then? Who cares if she means to?</p><p>Throughout, her metaphors grow feverishly mixed: “It was as though the media was holding up a doll of me and gesturing at random to different parts in search of kindling to feed the fire of the story”; “it looked as if someone had drained my body of blood like the Black Dahlia and strung up the shell of me at the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade.” The pseudo-literary affectations in “American Canto” are frequent and pointless. One of the most grating is Nuzzi’s refusal to use proper names, even when their referents are glaringly obvious: “the Politician” for RFK Jr., “the digital everything-company” for Amazon. Throughout, the wildfires that decimated parts of Los Angeles in the winter of 2025 furnish material for vacant, baggy musings and the vaguest suggestion of a guiding metaphor. “That we came from fire and return to fire, that we move forward only because we have learned to tame some fires, that here at least untamed fire is the greatest present threat to life,” one particularly grandiose fragment reads.</p><p class="rw-outer-content"><span>Some content could not be imported from the original document.</span> <a href="https://washingtonpost.com/books/2025/12/02/olivia-nuzzi-american-canto-memoir-review/">View content ↗ </a></p><p class="rw-outer-content"><span>Some content could not be imported from the original document.</span> <a href="https://washingtonpost.com/books/2025/12/02/olivia-nuzzi-american-canto-memoir-review/">View content ↗ </a></p><p>But it must be admitted that Nuzzi is not always so gratuitously indulgent. She was and is a capable chronicler of the mercurial showman in the White House. A good third of the fragments in “American Canto” are political vignettes, some of them lifted directly from New York magazine pieces, all of them piquantly observed. Donald Trump, Nuzzi writes in one exemplary passage, “was a flash of Technicolor, deeply saturated, as though he had stepped out of a television, and in certain contexts his presence suggested a kind of glitch. In Midtown, he made perfect sense. In Vegas, even more so. … In the White House, none at all, but in such a way that sense inverted; his realness was not a question, but the set of the White House seemed in doubt.” The descriptive passages in these more sober sections display an admirable restraint. In place of the canyons and the monsters and the all-too-pregnant natural imagery, there are sensible, well-placed similes. On a dreary winter day in Atlantic City, the “recently shuttered casinos … rose from the empty streets like headstones.”</p><p class="rw-outer-content"><span>Some content could not be imported from the original document.</span> <a href="https://washingtonpost.com/books/2025/12/02/olivia-nuzzi-american-canto-memoir-review/">View content ↗ </a></p><p class="rw-outer-content"><span>Some content could not be imported from the original document.</span> <a href="https://washingtonpost.com/books/2025/12/02/olivia-nuzzi-american-canto-memoir-review/">View content ↗ </a></p><p>A book that consisted solely of impressionistic dispatches from 10 years of reporting on Trump would have been good, perhaps even great, but it would also have been less splashy. It would not have occasioned a fawning New York Times profile or given rise to breathless speculation in innumerable group chats. And yet the gossip that is ostensibly this book’s chief selling point is scarcely in evidence. The few bombshells it contains are feeble. Nuzzi had already accused her ex-fiancé, Lizza, of illicitly accessing her phone and leaking evidence of her affair to her employer, so it comes as no surprise that she does so again here. For close to a year, the tabloids have been eagerly relaying the rumor that Kennedy asked Nuzzi to have his baby, so the passage in which she recounts that he did exactly that is only to be expected. The handful of supposed revelations are dubious: Nuzzi alleges that RFK Jr. asked her to be the fall guy when their liaison was uncovered, and she charges him with “engineering stories that relied on anonymous allegations from himself.” She adds, for good measure, that Lizza cheated on her with a woman who worked on the Democratic presidential campaign.</p><p>Maybe he did. Maybe he didn’t. I can’t say that I care either way. I can’t say I care very much about any of it, because Nuzzi risks so little of herself throughout. There could have been a version of this book in which she dared to interpret her fall from grace as continuous with the country’s — in which she, too, was shocked to find herself seduced by charismatic vulgarity, in which she admitted to ugliness or inelegance. In an interview with the journalist Vera Papisova that she reproduces in the book, she discusses the strain she endured while embedded in the funhouse-mirror world of the Trump administration. “I wouldn’t say I go native, exactly, but I have a kind of Method reporting style,” she explained. “Eventually, I reached this point where it got to be too much, there was no separation.”</p><p class="rw-outer-content"><span>Some content could not be imported from the original document.</span> <a href="https://washingtonpost.com/books/2025/12/02/olivia-nuzzi-american-canto-memoir-review/">View content ↗ </a></p><p class="rw-outer-content"><span>Some content could not be imported from the original document.</span> <a href="https://washingtonpost.com/books/2025/12/02/olivia-nuzzi-american-canto-memoir-review/">View content ↗ </a></p><p>In the end, she did go native, but her account of her infatuation and the ensuing ordeal is a string of overwrought evasions. You shouldn’t write a memoir unless you are willing to make yourself look foolish and pathetic. Nuzzi breaks this cardinal rule, flattering herself by admitting to only the chicest kinds of disintegration. She tells us that she didn’t eat or sleep, that she grew remote and aloof, that she lit a lot of candles, drove around California in a<b> </b>Mustang convertible and had very glamorous breakdowns while gazing wistfully at the sky. She is wholly unwilling to expose the heart of her attraction to an object as unlikely as RFK Jr. The clichés she attributes to RFK instead — “I would die before I hurt you,” “I wish I could just be with you,” “My heart is bursting” — are sure to disappoint both gawkers and belletrists, who, in the end, want the same thing.</p><p>Good literature and good gossip have in common that they are both savagely and mortifyingly honest. They plumb the depths and reveal the sordid details. They don’t save face; they rip it off to expose the raw venation beneath. But as Philip Roth once wrote in “American Pastoral,” a better book about this country, “All that rose to the surface was more surface.” Beneath posturing there is only more posturing.</p><p>And in all that posturing, not one glimpse of the worm that crawled into Olivia Nuzzi’s brain and made her fall so ravenously in love.</p><h5>American Canto</h5><h7>By Olivia Nuzzi</h7><h7>Avid Reader. 303 pp. $30</h7></body></html>
