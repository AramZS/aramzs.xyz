<p>My students’ easy access to chatbots forced me to make humanities instruction even more human.</p>
<p>Carlo Rotella is the author of “What Can I Get Out of This?: Teaching and Learning in a Classroom Full of Skeptics.” He has been teaching English courses at Boston College for 25 years.</p>
<p>At the end of a class in mid-September, as everyone was gathering their things, a student named Tyler approached me. “Can we talk sometime about how we can ask the questions on our own?” he said. “We always have you to ask the questions and set up how we’re going to discuss and analyze, but I’d like to know how to do that for myself, for when we don’t have someone else to do it for us.”</p>
<p>I assured Tyler, whose open face under his ball cap bore the look of a guy who hoped he had not somehow offended, that this was a question he absolutely should be asking and that the short answer was yes. I told him to bring it up again at the beginning of our next class, when we could talk about it as a group. This put us a month ahead of schedule in achieving one of my goals in any class I teach: gradually turning over to students the responsibility for defining problems and deciding how to solve them.</p>
