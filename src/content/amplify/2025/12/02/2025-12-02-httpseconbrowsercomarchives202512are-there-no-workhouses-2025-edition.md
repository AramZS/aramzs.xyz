<p>Not quite in the spirit of the season, <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/trump-tapped-economist-describes-poverty-as-a-choice-in-rant-against-snap-recipients/ar-AA1RvMdA?ocid=finance-verthp-feeds">EJ Antoni</a> on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP):</p>
<blockquote><p>“…for many of these people, [poverty]’s a choice!”</p></blockquote>
<p>In point of fact <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/food-assistance/the-supplemental-nutrition-assistance-program-snap">CBPP indicates</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture <a href="https://www.fns.usda.gov/research/snap/characteristics-fy22">show that</a> nearly 80 percent of participants are in households with a child under age 18, an adult age 60 or older, or an individual who is disabled. Children under age 18 constitute 40 percent of all SNAP participants.</p></blockquote>
<p>and:</p>
<blockquote><p>Most SNAP participants who can work do so. Over half of individuals who were participating in SNAP in a typical month in 2015 were working in that month. Further, 74 percent worked in the year before or after that month (in the 25-month period). Rates were even higher when including work among other household members: 89 percent of households with children and a non-disabled adult included at least one member who worked in this 25-month period. More than two-thirds of SNAP participants are not expected to work, primarily because they are children, older adults, or disabled people.</p></blockquote>
<p>Don’t forget the last line of the exchange:</p>
<blockquote><p>“If they would rather die,” said Scrooge, “they had better do it, and decrease the surplus population.”</p></blockquote>
