<p>In 2008, the ten-year-old son of Rahm Emanuel, then a Democratic congressman, bet Mike Pence, then a Republican congressman, that Barack Obama would carry Pence’s home state of Indiana in that year’s Presidential election. Pence lost the bet—ten dollars—but never paid up. “Every time I see him, I tease him,” Emanuel recounted recently. “ ‘You owe ten plus cumulative interest.’ ” Emanuel was seated at a table with Pence for a joint appearance on “Ceasefire,” a new C-<em>SPAN</em> show. Teasing aside, the pair bathed each other in mutual respect. Emanuel said that, off camera, they had asked after each other’s children, some of whom are in the armed forces, leading Dasha Burns, the host, to dub them “parents before partisans.” At the end of the show, Burns flashed a photo of Pence trying to hand Emanuel a ten-dollar bill in the green room.</p>
<aside data-testid="SidebarEmbed"><p><strong>The Lede</strong><br/><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/the-lede"><em>Reporting and commentary on what you need to know today.</em></a></p></aside>
<p>Such exchanges are foundational to the premise of “Ceasefire,” which has pitched itself as a “rare moment of unity” in a divided nation, and has described its “one goal” as helping warring politicians to find “common ground.” Since it launched, in October, viewers have heard about the Democrat Jared Moskowitz playing Santa Claus at the Republican Tim Burchett’s Christmas party, and the closeness of the wives of Senators James Lankford and Chris Coons; at the end of each episode, Burns highlights an instance of bipartisan comity, such as members of a “civility caucus” in the Minnesota state legislature singing together. Sam Feist, a veteran of CNN who took over C-<em>SPAN</em> last year, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/06/05/nx-s1-5422396/c-span-ceo-sam-feist-to-launch-ceasefire-a-new-weekly-program">told</a> NPR,“I am one of those people who believe that Americans actually agree on more than they disagree. I mean, we had Newt Gingrich and Bill Clinton in the nineties reach a balanced budget for the first time in a generation.” Indeed, Feist has <a data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/15/business/media/cspan-ceasefire.html"}' data-offer-url="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/15/business/media/cspan-ceasefire.html" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/15/business/media/cspan-ceasefire.html">said</a> that the idea for “Ceasefire” grew out of his work at CNN in that era, when he was a producer on something like the show’s opposite: “Crossfire,” a program that paired ideologically opposed hosts and guests, and gave them license to go for the jugular. According to Feist, Michael Kinsley, one of the liberal hosts on “Crossfire,” suggested, after leaving the show in the mid-nineties, that Feist should put together a more harmonious alternative. He’s carried the idea with him ever since.</p>
<p>Feist has stopped short of describing the new show as his “penance” for “Crossfire,” pointing out that C-<em>SPAN</em>—a network that broadcasts congressional proceedings and similarly wonkish programming as a public service, to an audience that is evenly balanced politically and boasts a high number of self-described moderates—has a different mission than CNN and the other corporate giants of cable news. Regardless, in today’s fractured media environment, the ability of <em>any</em> cable news show to set the terms of the national political debate is limited. The medium is in decline. The internet is ascendant, and anarchic.</p>
<p>And yet the models of exchange represented by “Crossfire” and “Ceasefire”—the vision of debate as a blood sport, in the first case, and as an avenue toward consensus, in the latter—are at the heart of a question that is much bigger and more enduring than one TV show, or even one medium: What does it mean for people to do politics with one another in public? That question now feels especially fraught, amid growing censorship and worrying political violence. I’ve been <a href="https://www.cjr.org/author/jon-allsop">a media critic</a> for most of the Trump era, and, throughout that time, have grappled with two concerns that are not necessarily contradictory but do often feel in tension with each other. The first is that institutions dedicated to the pursuit of truth are giving a platform to toxic figures who spread blatant lies. The second is that mainstream U.S. political culture dismisses fire-breathing radicals on both sides as fundamentally illegitimate—especially notable to me given the overt rudeness of discourse in my native Britain—and promotes civility and triangulated compromise as good outcomes in themselves. (In reality, balancing the budget has winners and losers, like every other policy.)</p>
<p>It now seems clear that attempts to contain toxicity have failed utterly. Insisting that people be nice to one another in such a climate is often well intentioned. But, in my view, it is a utopian expectation, and perhaps a dangerous one, which actors with no interest at all in civility might even co-opt as yet another means of quieting dissent. In other words, watching “Ceasefire,” I found myself wishing that C-<em>SPAN</em> had remade “Crossfire” instead.</p>
<p>There almost wasn’t a “Crossfire” to remake. In the early eighties, Reese Schonfeld, the C.E.O. of CNN, then a fledgling network, hired Pat Buchanan, the hard-line conservative and future Presidential candidate, and Tom Braden, a moderate liberal, to anchor a show that would subject a newsworthy figure to cross-examination from different political perspectives. According to Schonfeld, Ted Turner, who founded CNN, hated the plan—he apparently thought that Buchanan and Braden were “turkeys”—and wanted to abandon it, but by that point the hosts had signed contracts, and so Turner relented. Initially, the show was scheduled in the half hour before midnight on the East Coast, but it was soon moved forward a few hours, and scored big ratings. The goal was not necessarily to unleash shouting matches, but some of the early episodes were quite contentious. In 1982, Braden unloaded on the Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, calling him “a damned disgrace to the country” and mocking him repeatedly for wearing a “bedsheet.” A few years later, the musician Frank Zappa debated the permissibility of obscene song lyrics, and failed to disguise his contempt for his interlocutor, a conservative columnist. “Do you want to spank me here?” Zappa goaded him. “I love it when you froth like that.”</p>
<p>Over the years, the format changed—including via the addition of a live audience—as did the cast. In 2004, the Democratic strategist Paul Begala and a fresh-faced, bow-tie-wearing journalist named Tucker Carlson were at the desk on what would turn out to be the night that “Crossfire” died, at the hand, of all people, of the comedian Jon Stewart. Stewart had criticized the show before—according to one of his producers, he had a “real bee in his bonnet” about it—but Begala and Carlson nonetheless seemed taken aback when he came into the studio, sat across from them, and dismissed them as “partisan, erm, what do you call it, <em>hacks,</em>” who were “hurting America” by staging theatrical fights that undermined substantive discussion. Carlson defended “Crossfire” as an effort to hold politicians’ feet to the fire, and accused Stewart of soft-soaping John Kerry, then the Democratic Presidential nominee, in a recent interview on his Comedy Central show. “You’re on CNN!” Stewart yelled back. “The show that leads into me is puppets making crank phone calls! What is wrong with you?” Carlson concluded that Stewart was “more fun” on his show, and told him so. Stewart retorted that Carlson was “as big a dick” on his show as he was on any.</p>
<p>Stewart’s diatribe—the comedic edge of which could not mask its furious sincerity—hit a nerve. A writer for the <em>Times</em> <a data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/20/arts/television/no-jokes-or-spin-its-time-gasp-to-talk.html"}' data-offer-url="https://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/20/arts/television/no-jokes-or-spin-its-time-gasp-to-talk.html" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/20/arts/television/no-jokes-or-spin-its-time-gasp-to-talk.html">likened</a> him to Howard Beale, the “mad as hell” newsman from “Network,” and argued that he had channelled viewers’ frustrations with “gladiator-style infotainment” designed to “rile” rather than inform. The Washington <em>Post</em> <a data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/2004/10/21/no-more-miss-america-pageantry-for-abc/7bf6a57a-eddc-41b8-9f59-6518aac241f8/"}' data-offer-url="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/2004/10/21/no-more-miss-america-pageantry-for-abc/7bf6a57a-eddc-41b8-9f59-6518aac241f8/" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/2004/10/21/no-more-miss-america-pageantry-for-abc/7bf6a57a-eddc-41b8-9f59-6518aac241f8/">referred</a> to Carlson and his fellow-hosts as “Yapping Pests.” The <em>Post</em> also suggested that Stewart’s appearance had been a boon to “Crossfire” in terms of elevating its relevance. But a few months later CNN’s president cancelled the program, <a data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/06/business/media/cnn-will-cancel-crossfire-and-cut-ties-to-commentator.html"}' data-offer-url="https://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/06/business/media/cnn-will-cancel-crossfire-and-cut-ties-to-commentator.html" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/06/business/media/cnn-will-cancel-crossfire-and-cut-ties-to-commentator.html">telling</a> the press that he had agreed “wholeheartedly” with Stewart’s critique and signalling that he would shift the network’s output from “head-butting debate shows” toward “roll-up-your-sleeves storytelling.” (Carlson, incredibly from today’s vantage, moved on to MSNBC.) A top CNN journalist <a data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/2005/01/06/carlson-38/0a2f52f6-6231-4251-a591-cca355e380f3/"}' data-offer-url="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/2005/01/06/carlson-38/0a2f52f6-6231-4251-a591-cca355e380f3/" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/2005/01/06/carlson-38/0a2f52f6-6231-4251-a591-cca355e380f3/">told</a> the <em>Post</em> that “Crossfire” had come to be seen as the TV equivalent of “people asking each other if they still beat their wife.”</p>
<p>More recently, the format has met something of a reappraisal. In 2015, Begala <a data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://edition.cnn.com/2015/02/12/opinion/begala-stewart-blew-up-crossfire"}' data-offer-url="https://edition.cnn.com/2015/02/12/opinion/begala-stewart-blew-up-crossfire" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2015/02/12/opinion/begala-stewart-blew-up-crossfire">reflected</a> that, with hindsight, America could have used <em>more</em> noisy dissent in the buildup to the war in Iraq. Outsiders to the show have also defended it, or, at least, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/04/10/tucker-carlsons-fighting-words">expressed bafflement</a> at its punching-bag status; Ian Crouch, for instance, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/back-in-the-crossfire">wrote</a>, in this magazine, that Stewart’s takedown had come to seem “less nuanced and insightful,” and was ignorant of the reality that “true debate <em>requires</em> passion and theatrics as much as intellect.” By 2023, <em>Politico</em>’s Michael Schaffer was <a data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2023/04/07/bring-back-crossfire-00090842"}' data-offer-url="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2023/04/07/bring-back-crossfire-00090842" href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2023/04/07/bring-back-crossfire-00090842">calling</a> for the show’s comeback, arguing that, in a world of siloed echo chambers, the relative absence of content involving an exchange of views “might even be, um, hurting America.”</p>
<p>“Crossfire” has not come back. (An attempted revival in the mid-twenty-tens, featuring Gingrich and Van Jones, among others, seemed to lack bite, and scarcely lasted a year.) But the underlying idea does seem to be enjoying a resurgence. Since last year, “NewsNight,” Abby Phillip’s prime-time CNN show—which, as one media reporter <a data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/cspan-sam-feist-ceasefire-crossfire-tv-news-1236540678/"}' data-offer-url="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/cspan-sam-feist-ceasefire-crossfire-tv-news-1236540678/" href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/cspan-sam-feist-ceasefire-crossfire-tv-news-1236540678/">put it</a>, is often “more ‘Crossfire’ than ‘Crossfire’ ever was”—has pitted brawlers from both sides against one another, with results that are occasionally riveting (see: the journalist Catherine Rampell daring the Trump ally Scott Jennings, who had defended Elon Musk against allegations that he gave a <em>Sieg heil</em>, to replicate the gesture if it was so innocuous), occasionally appalling (see: the right-wing commentator Ryan Girdusky smearing the Muslim journalist Mehdi Hasan as a terrorist sympathizer, ostensibly as a joke), and usually somewhere in between. Either way, people seem to be watching it.</p>
<p>On social media, too, angry-debate formats are very much in the Zeitgeist—an outgrowth, to no small extent, of the cocksure “Debate me!” culture of right-wing bros who rose to online prominence during Trump’s first term. <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/09/22/charlie-kirk-murder-and-the-crisis-of-political-violence">Charlie Kirk</a> perfected that form by touring college campuses, where he sparred with “woke” adversaries; this past summer, a liberal streamer known as Destiny snuck into a gathering of Kirk’s group, Turning Point USA, and debated a manosphere influencer in what one attendee likened to “a cockfight.” Last year, a company called Jubilee Media launched “Surrounded,” a web show on which some flavor of provocateur (Kirk went first) is, well, <em>surrounded</em> by intellectual adversaries, who take turns arguing back until they are voted out by their peers. Here, too, the results can be hard to watch: when Hasan, who was born in the U.K. <a href="https://www.cjr.org/special_report/mehdi_hasan_america.php">but is a U.S. citizen</a>, appeared, one of his interlocutors said that he should be deported; another proudly self-identified as a fascist. But, again, people are watching. Hasan and others have said that they did “Surrounded” at the urging of their kids.</p>
<p>If this is a moment of heightened disputatiousness, both Phillip’s show and “Surrounded” have nonetheless been condemned, in distinctly Stewartian fashion, for handing a platform to dishonest partisan hacks more interested in wrestling than in enlightenment. (Perhaps tellingly, both shows have pitched themselves in softer terms that seem aimed at preëmpting such criticism; Jubilee’s founder has <a data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2025/01/jubilee-media-profile/681411/"}' data-offer-url="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2025/01/jubilee-media-profile/681411/" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2025/01/jubilee-media-profile/681411/">said</a> that he is trying to build the “Disney of empathy.”) Following Hasan’s appearance on “Surrounded,” Brady Brickner-Wood <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-lede/nobody-wins-on-surrounded">wrote</a>, in this magazine, that the show serves up “brain-eroding slop” that “offers little more to the viewer than lobotomization.” Another critique is that such content doesn’t represent the “real” country, much of which sits in some imagined moderate center, or even the work of politics, which is friendlier in the smoke-filled rooms where decisions actually get made than it is in public. “Ceasefire” is premised on shining a light into those rooms, and on modelling respectful dialogue aimed at reaching consensus on big problems.</p>
<p>These are noble goals. But what politicians say publicly shapes the world at least as much as behind-the-scenes chummery does. And any bipartisan ceasefire must take effect at a set of political coördinates that are not value-neutral. (Begala’s Iraq example comes to mind.) As I see it, shows like “Ceasefire” risk conflating civility with unity, or at least blur the boundaries between these two very different concepts. Disagreement doesn’t <em>require</em> rancor, and there are shows out there that are civil without seeking compromise; <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-new-yorker-interview/ezra-klein-argues-for-big-tent-politics">Ezra Klein</a>’s <em>Times</em> podcast, on which he patiently unspools ideas with articulate opponents of his liberal world view, is one example. This type of exchange can fulfill what I consider to be the primary function of debate, which is not to represent some majority viewpoint but to stretch and stress-test ideas, including ones perceived as outlandish. As Crouch observed, though, that process <em>is</em> often passionate—especially when the stakes are so high.</p>
<p>When I started thinking about this article, the distinction between “Crossfire” and “Ceasefire” styles of debate felt metaphorical. In September, after Kirk was tragically assassinated while debating with students at Utah Valley University, that changed. Among mainstream politicians and commentators, there came urgent calls to turn down the temperature and, in the words of Utah’s governor, Spencer Cox, “disagree better.” Meanwhile, Trump and his allies started to use the killing as a pretext to silence voices that they don’t like. ABC briefly <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/on-television/how-jimmy-kimmel-succumbed-to-donald-trumps-culture-wars-playbook">suspended</a> the late-night host Jimmy Kimmel for remarks that he made about Kirk’s death, following threats from the head of the Federal Communications Commission that even some Republicans later likened to the language of a Mob boss. The State Department revoked the visas of at least six people who “celebrated” Kirk’s death. A Tennessee man posted a meme highlighting Trump’s more dismissive response to a prior school shooting, and then was arrested on the spurious ground that he was threatening violence. The man was jailed for more than a month.</p>
<p>A debate soon emerged as to whether <em>debate</em> was really what Kirk had been doing. Many observers portrayed him, in the <a data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.salon.com/2025/09/17/how-debate-me-bro-culture-ruined-civil-discourse/"}' data-offer-url="https://www.salon.com/2025/09/17/how-debate-me-bro-culture-ruined-civil-discourse/" href="https://www.salon.com/2025/09/17/how-debate-me-bro-culture-ruined-civil-discourse/">words</a> of Katherine Kelaidis in <em>Salon</em>, as “a modern-day Socrates, wandering the agora of America’s universities seeking to find truth by means of rhetorical contest”; Klein <a data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/11/opinion/charlie-kirk-assassination-fear-politics.html"}' data-offer-url="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/11/opinion/charlie-kirk-assassination-fear-politics.html" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/11/opinion/charlie-kirk-assassination-fear-politics.html">wrote</a> in the <em>Times</em> that Kirk had been “practicing politics in exactly the right way,” and was one of his era’s “most effective practitioners of persuasion.” This characterization, especially as posited by Klein, drew howls of outrage from many commentators on the left, who argued that Kirk wasn’t interested in changing anyone’s mind, and instead practiced a form of performance art in which he would lure less experienced debaters into rhetorical traps that he could then post online under domineering titles such as “Charlie Kirk SHUTS DOWN 3 Arrogant College Students 👀🔥”—all while dehumanizing various marginalized communities and sowing hate. Kirk’s style was “to civil discourse what porn is to sex,” Kelaidis wrote. “An intentionally titillating, vaguely degrading, commodified reproduction of something that is normally good, or at least neutral.”</p>
<p>While I prefer the “Crossfire” model to the “Ceasefire” model, that is not to give it carte blanche. Debates, however sharp, must take place within subjective lines. After Girdusky’s vile comments to Hasan on Phillip’s CNN show, he was gone by the end of the next ad break, then barred from the network altogether. (Less defensibly, Hasan was not invited back in the year that followed, either.) Hasan, an outstanding debater, once <a href="https://www.cjr.org/special_report/mehdi_hasan_america.php">told me</a> that he wouldn’t appear alongside politicians who deny basic reality; following his appearance on “Surrounded,” he said that he wouldn’t have done it if he’d known that he’d be debating fascists, whose ideology, ultimately, is incompatible with the democratic principles that underpin any form of debate. Even the far right has its boundaries; recently, a furious intra-<em>MAGA</em> row exploded over Carlson’s decision to interview <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/fault-lines/nick-fuentes-is-not-just-another-alt-right-boogeyman">Nick Fuentes</a>, an open antisemite. Some of the critics took issue less with Carlson hosting Fuentes than with his failure to tear him a new one. But at least one right-winger apparently found Fuentes to be undebatable: Kirk, who banned him from T.P.U.S.A. events.</p>
<p>Although political violence is not as new to America as some commentators might have it, this is clearly a time for <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/12/08/in-the-line-of-fire">particular vigilance</a> against calls for it, or endorsements thereof. But loud, blunt argument is not in itself threatening; indeed, to concede otherwise is to buy the logic of the chilling—not to mention deeply hypocritical—right-wing urge to censor fair, if biting, criticism of Kirk’s views after his murder. In the wake of such horrors, turning the temperature down is instinctively more appealing than keeping it high. But what if heated debate doesn’t lead to further violence? What if it’s a pressure valve that helps prevent it?</p>
<p>At the very least, when Jubilee, for instance, pits a self-admitted fascist against Hasan, that reflects a preëxisting current in wider society more than it creates one. And though the most appalling moments from such shows tend to go the most viral, the shows themselves are not uniformly reprehensible. I’ve watched several episodes of “Surrounded”—featuring not only Kirk and Hasan but the left-wing Cenk Uygur and right-wing <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/annals-of-communications/the-gospel-of-candace-owens">Candace Owens</a>—and been impressed by the rigor with which their positions have been examined, certainly compared with the oversimplified fare that typically gets served on cable news. The Hasan episode may have been scary at times, but it at least exposed the extent of the radicalism on the modern right, as Hasan at one point acknowledged. In an age decried for its low attention spans, such debates are also notable for their length: an hour or more, in full.</p>
<p>Of course, I hear you cry, the problem is precisely that the vilest clips are the ones that do go viral—a few droplets of poison extracted from a well are still, after all, poison. This is true. But the novel issue here is the ability of a handful of unaccountable social-media behemoths to determine <em>which</em> debates—and which <em>parts</em> of debates—we pay attention to. Debate itself has always had a capacity for coarseness, and to elevate contentious interlocutors (see again: Braden versus the K.K.K.); since time immemorial, people have argued not to change others’ minds, or their own, but to win. (One classicist even <a data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/whats-wrong-with-online-debate-me-culture/2019/08/29/c0ec8aa2-c9ca-11e9-8067-196d9f17af68_story.html"}' data-offer-url="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/whats-wrong-with-online-debate-me-culture/2019/08/29/c0ec8aa2-c9ca-11e9-8067-196d9f17af68_story.html" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/whats-wrong-with-online-debate-me-culture/2019/08/29/c0ec8aa2-c9ca-11e9-8067-196d9f17af68_story.html">dubbed</a> Socrates “the original ‘debate me’ troll.”) In this moment, left-wingers increasingly seem to have realized that the answer to modern trolls surfing debate formats to virality isn’t dissociation and containment but to get in the ring and fight back. In the context of rising authoritarianism and censorship, there is something urgent, even noble, in defending your ideas without apology.</p>
<p>The media companies, old and new, whose job it is to convene debates often don’t think in such ideological terms—even if their speech, too, is under threat right now. “Ceasefire,” for its part, is just one such show among many; in a marketplace of ideas, there should, indeed, be room for it. But, watching its first episodes, I wanted its guests to put their paeans to friendship aside and more rigorously challenge one another. The “Crossfire” format can be more or less edifying, but “Ceasefire” does feel limited by its coöperative premise. In this scary, divided moment, the appeal of that premise is understandable. But I’m not sure that friendly bipartisanship is what’s most at threat right now. And I worry that focussing on it whitewashes what really is.</p>
<p>Shortly after “Ceasefire” débuted, Stewart <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-new-yorker-interview/will-paramount-cancel-jon-stewart">appeared</a> with David Remnick, the editor of this magazine, at our annual festival, where he levelled a withering criticism against the social-media companies that he sees as dividing people—a very “Crossfire” moment, even if, this time, his targets were too powerful to take down. “Social media is ultra-processed speech, in the same way that Doritos are food,” he said. “It’s designed to bypass the parts of your brain that keep you off it, that keep you from diving into those holes, from radicalizing yourself. That’s what you’re up against. They are designing these things in the lab to bypass our ability to collaborate and coöperate.”</p>
<p>Later in the conversation, Stewart sounded a somewhat different note. Remnick asked him about appearing on <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/03/24/the-battle-for-the-bros">Joe Rogan’s podcast</a>, which, he pointed out, has given oxygen to some “Nazi-curious” people. “It’s not acceptable to just say, ‘Well, I don’t like what he does,’ ” Stewart said. Opponents of such figures have to “beat them at their own game,” rather than complain that a noxious figure has a platform. “There’s no one in this world right now that isn’t platformed,” he said.</p>
<p>Stewart also recalled that he once chose to interview Donald Rumsfeld, who had served as George W. Bush’s Defense Secretary, despite viscerally opposing Rumsfeld’s role in the Iraq War. Stewart challenged Rumsfeld, but the conversation was generally cordial, and Stewart came to regret not pushing harder. “I lost more sleep over that interview than he did over the entire fucking war,” Stewart told Remnick. Afterward, Rumsfeld wrote him a note saying that the exchange was “fun,” and that the pair could have been friends when they were younger, Stewart added. “Do you have any idea how that still hurts?” ♦</p>
