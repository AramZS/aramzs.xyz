title: House Democrats Release New Photos From Epstein’s Estate

<p>WASHINGTON (AP)—House Democrats released a selection of photos from the estate of <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/jeffrey-epstein" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Jeffrey Epstein</a> on Friday, including some of Donald Trump, Bill Clinton and the former Prince Andrew.</p>
<p>The 19 photos released by Democratic lawmakers on the House Oversight Committee were a small part of more than 95,000 they received from the estate of Epstein, who <a href="https://apnews.com/article/jeffrey-epstein-jail-suicide-prison-death-8d194a756f2b429067f009a0c70f96c0" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">died in a New York jail cell</a> in 2019 while awaiting sex trafficking charges. The photos released Friday were separate from the case files that the Department of Justice is now <a href="https://apnews.com/article/epstein-sex-trafficking-case-records-justice-department-016bbded12959c90d1679e15aa273b60" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">compelled to release</a>, but anticipation is growing as the Trump administration faces a deadline next week to produce the highly anticipated Epstein files.</p>
<p>The photos were released without captions or context and included a black-and-white image of Trump alongside six women whose faces were blacked out.</p>
<p>Rep. Robert Garcia, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, did not say whether any of the women in the photos was a victim of abuse, but he added, “Our commitment from day one has been to redact any photo, any information that could lead to any sort of harm to any of the victims.”</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the Republican-controlled House Oversight Committee accused Garcia and Democratic lawmakers of “cherry-picking photos and making targeted redactions to create a false narrative about President Trump,” adding that nothing in the documents the committee has received shows “any wrongdoing” by the president.</p>
<p>Many of the photos have already circulated in the public. Democrats pledged to continue to release photos in the days and weeks ahead, as they look to pressure Trump over his Republican administration’s earlier refusal to release documents in the Epstein probe. Garcia said that his staff had looked through about a quarter of the images it had received from Epstein’s estate, which included photos that were sent to him or that he had in his possession.</p>
<p>“Donald Trump right now needs to release the files to the American public so that the truth can come out and we can actually get some sense of justice for the survivors,” Garcia added.</p>
<p>The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the photos.</p>
<p>Trump, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-epstein-conspiracies-97200cfab77572a36bc9ab25841a8833" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">once a close friend</a> of Epstein, has said that he parted ways with him long before he faced the sex trafficking charges. Clinton, too, has minimized his relationship with Epstein, acknowledging that he traveled on Epstein’s private jet but saying through a spokesperson that he had no knowledge of the late financier’s crimes. Clinton also has never been accused of misconduct by Epstein’s known victims. However, Republicans on the House committee are pushing him and Hillary Clinton to testify in their investigation.</p>

<p>Andrew <a href="https://apnews.com/article/prince-andrew-charles-epstein-chinese-spy-91c4bec9a5cf3de8fcb16f9c1fe52e60" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">lost his royal titles and privileges</a> this year amid new revelations of his ties to Epstein, though he has denied wrongdoing.</p>
<p>The photo release also included images of the right-wing political operative Steven Bannon, billionaires Richard Branson and Bill Gates, filmmaker Woody Allen, former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers and law professor Alan Dershowitz. The men have denied any wrongdoing in their associations with Epstein, who kept many high-profile figures in his circle of friends.</p>
<p>Amid a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/larry-summers-harvard-jeffrey-epstein-bebad1142f859c15467ed010c08ea6fa" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">release of emails between Summers and Epstein</a>, Summers stepped away from his teaching position at Harvard University and faced other fallout to his standing in academic circles.</p>
<p>Allen has faced allegations from his adopted daughter, Dylan Farrow, of molesting her as a child. He has denied the allegations.</p>
<p>Some lawmakers, however, believe that other high-powered figures could be implicated in Epstein’s abuse if the full case files from the Justice Department are released.</p>
<p>Rep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican who was instrumental in passing a bill to require the public release of the files, said it was a good sign that the Department of Justice has sought to have grand jury material released from several courts.</p>
<p>“The grand jury material is just a small fraction of what the DOJ needs to release, because the FBI and DOJ probably has evidence that they chose not to take to the grand jury because the evidence they’re in possession of would implicate other people, not Epstein or Maxwell,” he said.</p>
