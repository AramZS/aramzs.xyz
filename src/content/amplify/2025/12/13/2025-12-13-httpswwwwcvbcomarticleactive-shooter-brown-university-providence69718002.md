<p><strong>PROVIDENCE, R.I. —</strong></p>
<p>Multiple people were shot Saturday in the area of <a href="https://www.brown.edu/">Brown University</a> in Providence, Rhode Island, as law enforcement officials warned of an active shooter situation.</p>
<p>The school sent a message warning of an active shooter near Barus &amp; Holley — a building that houses the School of Engineering and the Physics Department. Another alert warned of shots fired near Governor Street.</p>
<p>The school later said a person was taken into custody and then later corrected the alert saying a suspect had not been detained.</p>
<p>"Continue to shelter in place. Remain away from Barus &amp; Holley area. Police do not have a suspect in custody and continue to search for suspect(s). Brown coordinating with multiple law enforcement agencies on site. Emergency medical on scene. Stay tuned for further safety Stay tuned for further safety information," the updated alert read.</p>
<p>Dozens of law enforcement officials, some carrying long weapons, were seen in the area, escorting students to safety.</p>
<p>"There is currently heavy Providence Police and Fire presence on Hope Street near Brown University. Please exercise caution and avoid this area until further notice," Providence police posted on X.</p>
<p>It's not clear if anyone was injured.</p>
<p>The Ivy League school is a private, nonprofit institution with about 7,300 undergraduates and just over 3,000 graduate students, according to its website.</p>
<p>WCVB will have more information as it becomes available.</p>
