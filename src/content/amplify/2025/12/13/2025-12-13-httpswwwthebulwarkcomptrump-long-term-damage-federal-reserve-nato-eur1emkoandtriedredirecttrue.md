<h2>1. Banana Republic</h2>
<p>One of the things we talk about here is how difficult it will be to repair the damage Donald Trump is doing to various liberal institutions. <em>Who will have the stomach to cleanse the FBI and DoJ?</em> I ask. <em>How much political capital would it take to rationalize the Supreme Court and de-Trumpify the Pentagon?</em></p>
<p>But those problems at least have theoretical answers. Trump is also creating structural problems to which there are <em>no</em> solutions.</p>
<p>The first is his attempt to politicize the central bank. <a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/the-sleeper-issue-that-could-destroy-the-economy-federal-reserve-trump-powell">Catherine Rampell wrote about this last night</a>, and it’s about more than just putting a puppet into the role of Federal Reserve chair with an explicit litmus test that the prospective nominee commit to cutting interest rates. Trump is also:</p>
<ul><li><p>Trying to fire sitting Fed governors</p></li><li><p>Appointing new Fed governors who literally <em>still work at the White House</em></p></li><li><p>Floating a plan to purge the existing Fed regional bank presidents by instituting a residency requirement that would make most of the incumbents ineligible</p></li></ul>
<p>As Catherine explains, if Trump succeeds in turning the Fed into a political agency, as he has done with the FBI and Department of Justice, it is likely to be very bad for the American economy.</p>
<p>But here’s what worries me:</p>
