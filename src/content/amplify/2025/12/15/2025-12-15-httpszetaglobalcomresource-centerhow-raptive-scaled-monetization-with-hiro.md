<h2>The Challenge</h2>
<p>Raptive, the leading creator media company, is dedicated to maximizing ad revenue for its portfolio of creators and publishers. As the digital advertising landscape evolves, Raptive faces the pressing challenge of preparing for the deprecation of third-party cookies while continuing to provide a future-proofed monetization solution to its publishers. A key driver to Raptive maintaining its value in their publishers’ ad stack lies in leveraging first-party data to drive sustainable revenue growth. However, monetizing non-addressable audiences—those without identifiers—remains a significant hurdle.</p>
<p>To stay ahead, Raptive must enhance addressability across its network inventory to maximize yield and help its publishers maintain a strong competitive edge. Yet, navigating the complex identity landscape requires finding the right partners—ones that can deliver measurable results while aligning with Raptive’s commitment to performance, transparency, and privacy. Raptive’s need for a reliable, first-party data-driven addressability solution has never been greater. Enter HIRO.</p>
<h2>The Solution</h2>
<p>By integrating with HIRO, Raptive transformed its non-addressable audiences into highly valuable, addressable inventory, unlocking significant revenue gains for its publishers. HIRO achieves this by mapping first-party cookies to stable identifiers while prioritizing user privacy. Leveraging one of the largest and richest identity graphs in the United States—built on reliable email inventory that validates matches daily, along with intent signals from authentic users taking action on the web —HIRO enables demand partners and programmatic advertisers to seamlessly recognize and target Raptive’s web inventory, resulting in higher bids, increased CPMs, and greater overall monetization.</p>
<p>To maximize addressability across its entire portfolio, Raptive implemented HIRO via its programmatic connections, ensuring seamless adoption at scale. To quantify the revenue impact, Raptive conducted a controlled test, disabling HIRO on 5% of page loads while enabling it on the remaining 95%, keeping all other factors constant. By comparing the proportional revenue generated between the test and control groups, Raptive can accurately measure the incremental lift driven by HIRO.</p>
<p>The results were clear: HIRO is the most valuable ID partner on 95%+ of the more than 5,600 domains managed by Raptive. These increases lead to higher overall monetization. With HIRO, Raptive has strengthened its competitive edge, ensuring its publishers remain at the forefront of digital advertising’s always-evolving landscape.</p>

<p>The ad-tech space is full of overhyped solutions that don’t deliver, but HIRO is the real deal. It seamlessly bridges the gap between our publishers and the demand side, turning non-addressable audiences into real revenue. It’s refreshing to work with a partner that actually delivers on its promises—HIRO has driven measurable CPM lifts and proven itself as a critical piece in our ability to drive monetization for our creators and publishers.</p>
