  House Must Reject Marjorie Taylor Greene’s Attempt To Criminalize Transgender
  Health Care
---
<p>WASHINGTON – The American Civil Liberties Union is urging members of the House of Representatives to vote “NO’ on a bill sponsored by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene that would criminalize the provision of gender-affirming medical care for any transgender person under 18 and subject providers to up to 10 years in federal prison.</p>
<p>This would be the most extreme anti-trans legislation ever considered by Congress.. These treatments, commonly referred to as gender-affirming medical care, are supported by the American Medical Association, the American Psychological Association, and the American Academy of Pediatrics. At the same time that the legislation criminalizes care for transgender youth, it explicitly endorses non-consensual surgical procedures on intersex youth and infants.</p>
<p>Greene <a href="https://x.com/RepMTG/status/1998866871056216433?s=20">announced on social media</a> that she has received a commitment from House leadership to bring the bill to the floor for a vote on December 17.</p>
<p>“This extreme bill puts the threat of prosecution between hundreds of thousands of families and their doctors and would put doctors behind bars for exercising their best medical judgment,” said <strong>Mike Zamore, National Director of Policy &amp; Government Affairs at the ACLU.</strong> “Passing this bill would be a grave escalation of an already severe effort to not only push transgender people out of public life but also allow the state to control our bodies and our lives further. Families with transgender youth across the country have already taken the dire step of leaving the United States for fear of exactly this kind of proposal becoming the law of the land. Abortion bans have already shown us the deadly consequences of putting baseless politics into our doctors’ offices. Every member of Congress who believes that health care decisions should stay between families and their doctors should vote no and vigorously oppose this bill’s passage. The fundamental equality of transgender people and our families is at stake now, but the implications of criminalizing health care could be far-reaching for everyone.”</p>
