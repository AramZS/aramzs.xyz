title: How American Nightlife Went Honky-Tonk

<h1>How American Nightlife Went Honky-Tonk</h1>
<h2>From New York City to Chicago to Portland, bars are riding a country boom, drawing everyone from outlaw singers to finance bros for ‘countryoke’ and line dancing</h2>
<p>On a chilly Friday night in early October, a shoulder-to-shoulder crowd thronged around the stage at Lucinda’s in Manhattan’s East Village. It was the bar’s weekly “countryoke” show: A four-piece band played while participants—from the startlingly talented to the tragically off-key—waited up to hours for the chance to belt out songs by Brooks &amp; Dunn, the Chicks and Luke Combs.</p>
<p>A recent New York University grad named Kelsey McLennan sang “Before He Cheats” by Carrie Underwood, stomping across the stage in cherry-red cowboy boots while the audience screamed along. Ashok “Shoky” Pai—a 56-year-old former party promoter turned country-nightlife fixture—led the room through a rousing rendition of “Take Me Home, Country Roads.” During an instrumental break, he yanked the emcee onstage to two-step with him.</p>
<p>“A lot of people have it in their head that New York and country don’t mix, but country’s mainstream now,” said Kelley Swindall, creator and managing partner of Lucinda’s, which bills itself as a honky-tonk and juke joint. “Everybody’s getting into it.”</p>

<p>American nightlife has gone honky-tonk. From New York City to Chicago to Portland, bars are hosting line-dancing events and live music performances that draw patrons dressed in cowboy boots, Wranglers and the occasional Stetson. These businesses are riding the wave of a country boom sweeping everything from <a href="https://www.wsj.com/arts-culture/music/country-music-shaboozey-zach-bryan-morgan-wallen-59734986?mod=article_inline">music</a> to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/arts-culture/television/taylor-sheridan-yellowstone-spinoffs-prequels-paramount-nbc-b2a07042?mod=article_inline">TV</a> to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/yellowstone-show-has-suburbanites-dressing-like-cattle-ranchers-11673536153?mod=article_inline">fashion</a>, with no sign of stopping.</p>
<p>Last year, Noah Aussems decided to close his Kips Bay sports bar Sucker Punch and partner with Chris Reda to renovate the space, importing wood from Kentucky and taxidermy from Indiana. They teased the grand reopening with Instagram photos of Bella Hadid astride a horse and videos of influencer types mugging for the camera in 10-gallon hats.</p>
<p>“A couple other places in New York City do a country or Western theme, but the difference between us and these other places is the authenticity of it,” Aussems said.</p>
<p>When they reopened the space, it had become Common Country: a full-on honky-tonk club, complete with $22 well drinks (which Aussems said contain a generous “Texas pour”) and Casamigos tequila bottle service. Its walls are decorated with American flags, deer mounts and Western movie posters. A sign above the DJ booth reads, “LONG LIVE COWBOYS.” There are hay bales everywhere.</p>
<p>Business had been sleepy at Sucker Punch. “The increase has been about 100%,” said Reda, who also co-owns the popular Meatpacking club Common Ground.</p>
<p>Common Country isn’t the only venue rebranding to meet the moment. Stolen Saddle in Chicago—a three-story, 16,000-square-foot behemoth on a busy strip near Wrigley Field—was, until recently, a tiki bar.</p>
<p>Country has always been popular, but its tent has never been so big. Pop stars like Beyoncé, Sabrina Carpenter and Chappell Roan have embraced the genre. Today’s Nashville hitmakers collaborate with artists from the worlds of <a href="https://www.wsj.com/arts-culture/music/christian-music-tiktok-forrest-frank-brandon-lake-2bb6bf81?mod=article_inline">Christian music</a>, Mexican regional and rap. Morgan Wallen, the reigning king of commercial country, blends hip-hop, hard-rock and honky-tonk in his music.</p>

<p>This expanded definition of the genre is on full display at Common Country. Stephanie Wagner, a Rockaways native who runs a website called Country Swag, runs the bar’s music programming. She often books local DJs who specialize in the crossover between country and electronic dance music, popularly known as “YEEDM” (pronounced to rhyme with EDM).</p>
<p>“It’s New York City nightlife meets country music. We do bottle service, we do sparklers, people are dancing on tables, but it’s country vocals over the beat,” Wagner said.</p>
<p>The proprietors of Desert 5 Spot in Brooklyn’s Williamsburg neighborhood also pride themselves on having an eclectic playlist. “We have DJs who play everything from Dwight Yoakam to Bruce Springsteen and Merle Haggard to Chappell Roan,” said Chase Manhattan, regional director of entertainment at Desert 5 Spot. The bar also plays YEEDM, he said, but “it certainly doesn’t define us.”</p>
<p>Known for its mechanical bull and the four-foot-tall, custom disco-ball cowboy boots that loom over its dance-floor, Desert 5 Spot, which first opened in Los Angeles in 2021, unveiled its Brooklyn outpost last year and has since expanded to D.C., with Miami on the way.</p>
<p>As liquor sales decline nationwide, bar operators have had to get creative to combat tightened purse strings and an increasingly health-conscious public. The Showdown saloon in Portland, Ore., offers weekly country-Western cabaret and burlesque shows on top of more standard-issue honky-tonk fare.</p>
<p>“We have the hipster country crowd and we love them, because they spend money,” said owner Frank Faillace. “But we also want to draw from the suburbs and the rural areas and do the stuff that gets actual country folk into the city.”</p>
<p>Popular culture has long shaped New York’s bar scene. In the late 1970s and early ’80s, at the height of “Texas Chic,” the Lone Star Cafe in Greenwich Village drew a voguish crowd of downtown types and hosted concerts by Willie Nelson and George Strait.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, across the country, establishments that had previously been disco-oriented were rebranding as “country discos” to capitalize on the fervor sparked by “Urban Cowboy” and its soundtrack. The line-dancing craze of the 1990s, spurred by Billy Ray Cyrus’s ubiquitous “Achy Breaky Heart” video, brought its own wave of country venues, which in turn stoked the demand for dancefloor-ready hits from stars like Shania Twain and Alan Jackson.</p>
<p>In more recent history, New Yorkers seeking a honky-tonk experience have flocked to the divey Skinny Dennis in Williamsburg, which opened in 2013. This year, the venture expanded with a new location five times the size of the original in the heart of American honky-tonk: Nashville.</p>

<p>Some see the current country wave as part of a broader <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/how-maga-is-taking-back-the-culture-e76a7b1d?mod=article_inline">conservative vibe shift</a> that accompanied President Trump’s re-election. There is precedent for that—the Urban Cowboy fad of the 1980s dovetailed with the rise of Reaganism.</p>
<p>Luke Timm, the doorman at Common Country—known to his TikTok following as simply “hot bouncer”—said his experience hasn’t felt political. “When I’m at the bar, it doesn’t feel like, ‘Oh, yeah, _America_.’ It just seems like we all like country music and we all like a Southern vibe,” Timm, 27, said.</p>
<p>Much as Willie Nelson mythically united the hippies and the cowboys in 1970s Austin, Swindall said Lucinda’s seeks to gather a representative crowd: the “New East Villagers” (read: yuppies), the Bushwick creatives (Swindall hosts an LGBTQ-friendly “Cxntry Club” event once a month), the NPR-loving old-time and bluegrass set out in Red Hook, and the hipsterish “cosmic cowboys” who frequent Honky Tonkin’ in Queens events in Ridgewood and worship at the altar of vintage Levi’s and Lone Star Beer.</p>
<p>In the spirit of its guiding light, the iconoclastic singer-songwriter Lucinda Williams, the bar has played host to other country nonconformists. In October, Texas troubadour Charley Crockett, who has derided the trap-inflected “bro country” coming out of Nashville, played a solo set at Lucinda’s before moving uptown for a three-night residency at Café Carlyle.</p>
<p>At Common Country, Wagner has leveraged her Nashville connections to entice mainstream country stars—including Hardy, known for the hit “Truck Bed” and his collaborations with Morgan Wallen—to drop in for social media-friendly appearances.</p>

<p>In this way, Common Country and Lucinda’s seem to exist on opposite ends of the eternal country music divide: glossy, highly produced “pop-country” on one side, and the harder-edged “outlaw” variety on the other.</p>
<p>At least on weekends, however, the audience doesn’t look all that different from one honky-tonk to the next; <a href="https://www.wsj.com/style/fashion/shiny-blowouts-chic-fashion-and-west-village-reservations-these-insta-perfect-lives-are-managed-by-one-woman-3900b99a?mod=article_inline">West Village Girls</a> and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/lifestyle/man-in-finance-song-tiktok-09ac3457?mod=article_inline">Wall Street guys</a> abound.</p>
<p>“The weekend crowd at these places is not really there for the music,” said Olivia Ellen Lloyd, a 34-year-old West Virginia-born musician who has been playing country music in New York since 2016. “It’s that ‘work hard, play hard’ crowd that’s always seeking whatever the novelty thing of the moment is.”</p>
<p>Christine Cherry, the booker at Daisy Duke’s in the Financial District, says the more the merrier.</p>
<p>“Those financial bros don’t bother me one bit because at the end of the night, guess who tips me the most?” said the Alabama native. Her band, CC and the Boys, has also played at Lucinda’s and nearly every other honky-tonk in town. “You can sit there and be stupid all night long. Put $100 in my tip bucket, and we’ll be friends.”</p>
