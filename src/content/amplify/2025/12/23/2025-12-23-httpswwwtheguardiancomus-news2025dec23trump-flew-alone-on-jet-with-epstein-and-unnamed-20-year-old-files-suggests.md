<h2 data-gu-name="standfirst">Claim by a senior US attorney about US president appears in latest batch of justice department documents </h2>
<p>A newly released batch of the so-called Epstein files includes many references to <a data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>, including a claim by a senior US attorney that the US president was on a flight in the 1990s with the now-deceased paedophile and a 20-year-old woman.</p>
<p>There is no indication of whether the woman was a victim of any crime, and being included in the files does not indicate any criminal wrongdoing.</p>
<p>The dump of files by the justice department follows a similar release last week of a section of the documents detailing its investigations into the billionaire sex offender.</p>
<p>There are numerous references to Trump, including an email that suggests he travelled on board Epstein’s private jet with women who would have been possible witnesses to the case against Epstein’s accomplice, <a data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ghislaine-maxwell">Ghislaine Maxwell</a>.</p>
<p>The email – sent by the US attorney for the southern district of New York on 7 January 2020 – has the subject “Epstein flight records”.</p>
<p>It reads: “For your situational awareness, wanted to let you know that the flight records we received yesterday reflect that Donald Trump traveled on Epstein’s private jet many more times than previously has been reported (or that we were aware), including during the period we would expect to charge in a Maxwell case.</p>
<p>“In particular, he is listed as a passenger on at least eight flights between 1993 and 1996, including at least four flights on which Maxwell was also present. He is listed as having traveled with, among others and at various times, Marla Maples, his daughter Tiffany, and his son Eric.</p>
<p>“On one flight in 1993, he and Epstein are the only two listed passengers; on another, the only three passengers are Epstein, Trump, and then-20-year-old REDACTED.</p>
<p>“On two other flights, two of the passengers, respectively, were women who would be possible witnesses in a [Ghislaine] Maxwell case.”</p>
<p>There are also numerous references in the new batch of files to Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, formerly known as Prince Andrew.</p>
<p>Trump vowed to release Epstein-related files as he campaigned to be president last year. This summer, his administration sparked a backlash after the justice department announced it would not release any files related to the late financier, and said it had found “no incriminating client list” despite earlier claims from Pam Bondi, the attorney general, that such a document was sitting on her desk.</p>
<p>The announcement sparked bipartisan outrage – including from some Trump supporters – and reignited scrutiny of Epstein’s past ties to Trump, with whom he was friendly for at least 15 years before falling out in 2004. The president has consistently denied any knowledge of or involvement in Epstein’s criminal activities.</p>
