<p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement has already hired 10 contractors to carry out its immigrant bounty hunting program, according to records reviewed by The Intercept. The firms included companies that had previous deals with spy agencies and the military, private investigators that boast of their physical surveillance skills, and a private prison giant.</p>
<p>In November, ICE launched a process to get private sector “skip tracing” services, where corporate investigators use digital snooping tools and on-the-ground surveillance to track immigrants in <a href="https://theintercept.com/2025/10/31/ice-plans-cash-rewards-for-private-bounty-hunters-to-locate-and-track-immigrants/">exchange for monetary bonuses</a>. ICE procurement records indicate the agency will be targeting as many as 1.5 million immigrants in the U.S.</p>

<p>Taken together, records show the 10 companies have been made over $1 million to date — and stand to make over $1 billion by the contract’s end in 2027. Some of the companies’ roles in the bounty hunting program have been previously reported, <a href="https://theintercept.com/2025/12/19/ice-bounty-hunters-location-surveillance-geo-group/">including by The Intercept</a>, but others — such as Bluehawk, EnProVera, and Gravitas — are being revealed here for the first time. (None of the 10 companies commented for this story.)</p>
<p>The <a href="https://theintercept.com/2025/02/11/corecivic-private-prison-trump-immigrant-detention/">bonanza</a> for federal contractors comes as the Trump administration’s focus on deportations has led to a massive <a href="https://theintercept.com/2025/07/01/trump-big-beautiful-bill-passes-ice-budget/">increase in ICE’s budget</a>. The companies range from those with extensive experience doing intelligence work to those with more mundane government contracting experience, like finding janitors for federal agencies.</p>
<p>Among the companies poised to cash in on the bounty hunting program, the largest potential haul — over $365 million — could go to Capgemini Government Solutions, a McLean, Virginia-based federal consultancy that has a long track record working for the departments of Defense and Homeland Security, including providing intelligence services for ICE.</p>
<p>Florida-based Bluehawk LLC stands to reap the second largest payout from bounty hunting, at over $200 million. Bluehawk is a longtime contractor for the Pentagon and U.S. intelligence community, providing intelligence collection and analysis, as well as counterintelligence services.</p>
<p>In September, Bluehawk <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/bluehawk-intelligence-services/posts/?feedView=all&amp;viewAsMember=true">announced</a> it was beginning counterintelligence work for the Department of Homeland Security. Like some of the other contractors tapped by ICE, the company is focusing on immigration after <a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/09/10/immigration-enforcement-homeland-security-911/">honing its capabilities doing war on terror-era </a>military and intelligence operations. The company’s advisers include former Defense Intelligence Agency chief Ronald Burgess and Dell Dailey, a retired Army lieutenant general who ran U.S. Joint Special Operations Command following the September 11 attacks.</p>
<p>Government Support Services, a<a href="https://gssglobal.org/"> contractor</a> that helps staff roles for janitors, groundskeepers, and security guards at agencies across the federal government, could make upward of $55 million on the bounty hunting program.</p>
<p>EnProVera, another company signed up for a contract on the bounty hunting program, also boasts a broad range of federal contracts. The company advertises a variety of intelligence-gathering and investigative services on its website, promoting its work with Customs and Border Protection.</p>
<p>EnProVera CEO Larry Grant’s past work experience includes “conducting clandestine overseas operations, authoring a highly classified study of a foreign nation’s technical capabilities,” and “architecting intelligence systems support to combat operations,” according to his biography page.</p>
<p>EnProVera could make nearly $3 million by the contract’s end.</p>
<p>Constellation Inc., which has previously landed administrative contracts across the Department of Homeland Security, is looking at a potential $58 million payday from bounty hunting.</p>
<p>SOS International, or SOSi, another experienced military contractor, landed a bounty hunting contract around when the program was revealed in November. SOSI’s skip-tracing work for the program, which was first reported by <a href="https://archive.is/o/DKU6y/https://www.levernews.com/ice-just-bought-a-social-media-surveillance-botice-just-bought-a-social-media-surveillance-bot/">The Lever</a>, could earn the firm up to $123 million. The company is a longtime military contractor whose past work spans operating a major military <a href="https://www.sosi.com/case-studies/logistics-training-case-studies/department-of-defense-operations-and-maintenance-support-in-iraq/">base</a> in Iraq to operating overseas <a href="https://www.sosi.com/intelligence/information-operations/military-information-operations/">propaganda</a> campaigns. SOSi’s website notes the company uses large language models in its government work.</p>
<p>Other firms have more traditional private investigative backgrounds.</p>
<p>Gravitas Investigations, which could make over $32 million through the bounty hunting contract, says it offers “comprehensive surveillance operations.” The company touts its skill at locating anyone using a combination of digital sleuthing and real-world tracking.</p>
<p>“We go where your Subject goes,” its website says. “We follow on foot, in a vehicle, onto public property, and anywhere legal. Our surveillance operatives covertly document your Subject’s activities with a handheld, high-definition camcorders, and covert cameras.”</p>
<p>Gravitas says it makes extensive use of social media and other online data to pinpoint individuals on its customers’ behalf.</p>
<p>The company Fraud Inc. “strives to validate our clients’ suspicions,” according to its website, using a variety of public and private databases, social media digging, and video surveillance. “We also can obtain legally high-altitude video,” it boasts.</p>
<p>Among the more novel firms on the bounty hunting contract is AI Solutions 87, whose role was recently <a href="https://www.404media.co/ice-contracts-company-making-bounty-hunter-ai-agents/">reported by 404 Media</a>. The company is providing “AI agents” to ICE that it says can autonomously track “people of interest and map out their family and other associates more quickly.”</p>
<p>Perhaps the most provocative bounty hunting firm is BI Incorporated, an immigrant-tracking <a href="https://theintercept.com/2025/12/19/ice-bounty-hunters-location-surveillance-geo-group/">subsidiary of GEO Group</a>, the for-profit prison giant whose <a href="https://theintercept.com/2025/07/10/corecivic-trump-big-beautiful-bill/">fortunes have rapidly climbed</a> following Trump’s reelection and the funding<a href="https://theintercept.com/2025/02/11/corecivic-private-prison-trump-immigrant-detention/"> boom</a> for deportation operations. With lucrative contracts for both hunting and imprisoning immigrants — its bounty hunting work could net $121 million by 2027 — GEO Group now stands to <a href="https://theintercept.com/2025/12/19/deportation-abrego-garcia-ice-immigration/">generate revenue through multiple stages</a> of the administration’s ongoing deportation campaign.</p>
