<p>The Supreme Court on Tuesday refused to allow the Trump administration to deploy National Guard troops in the Chicago area to support its immigration crackdown.</p>
<p>The justices declined the administration’s emergency request to overturn a ruling by U.S. District Judge April Perry that had blocked the deployment of troops. An appeals court also had refused to step in. The Supreme Court took more than two months to act.</p>
<p>The order is not a final ruling but it could affect other lawsuits challenging President Donald Trump’s attempts to deploy the military in other Democratic-led cities.</p>
<p>The outcome is a rare Supreme Court setback for Trump, who had won repeated victories in emergency appeals since he took office again in January.</p>
<p>Department of Justice attorneys previously called on U.S. District Judge April Perry — who issued the order, known as a TRO — to hold off on any future steps in the case until the high court had a chance to rule.</p>
<p>In October, attorneys for both the Trump administration and the state of Illinois agreed to extend that temporary restraining order halting that deployment sought by Trump until a judgment can be reached in the state’s lawsuit.</p>
<p>Trump administration attorneys OK’d the indefinite extension, likely with the belief that the high court would rule in their favor and toss out the TRO altogether.</p>
<p>The president’s emergency appeal came eight days after a federal judge temporarily blocked the federalization and deployment of 300 members of the Illinois National Guard, 200 members of the Texas National Guard and 14 members of the California National Guard into Illinois.</p>
<p>The Trump administration has claimed the deployment is necessary as federal agents in Illinois have been met “with prolonged, coordinated, violent resistance that threatens their lives and safety,” telling the Supreme Court this has become part of a “disturbing and recurring pattern.”</p>
<p>Attorneys representing Illinois called on the Supreme Court to deny the administration’s “dramatic step” of deploying National Guard troops over the state’s objection, claiming the Trump administration “cannot show that such extraordinary relief is warranted.”</p>
<p>Federal officials have only a “flimsy pretext” to deploy military officials to Chicago, according to the state’s lawsuit. Deploying National Guard troops to Chicago “will cause only more unrest, including harming social fabric and community relations and increasing the mistrust of police.”</p>
<p>The lawsuit accuses Trump and members of his administration of ordering troops to Chicago as part of a campaign that dates back to 2013 to denigrate Chicago, home to former President Barack Obama, a longtime political rival of the president.</p>
<p>In issuing the TRO, Perry said she saw “no credible evidence there is a danger of rebellion in the state of Illinois,” adding that she found “no evidence that the president is unable, with the regular forces, to execute the laws of the United States.”</p>
<p>Trump has deployed the Guard to Washington, D.C., and Memphis, Tennessee, to help fight what he says is rampant crime. Los Angeles was the first city where Trump deployed the Guard, arguing it was necessary to protect federal buildings and agents as protesters fought back against mass immigration arrests.</p>
