<h3>from the <i>more-vindictive-prosecutions</i> dept</h3>
<p>You generally don’t see criminal charges filed against judges at any level of the court system. If it does happen, it’s used to address egregious and constant criminal activity by sitting judges. The most common path towards discipline relies on the court system itself, which allows courts to punish judges for misbehavior and, in rare cases, have them removed via internal processes.</p>
<p>But this is no ordinary US. This is <em>Trump’s</em> United States, where anyone who displeases the man who wishes he could be king is subjected to vindictive prosecutions. What happened to New York Attorney General Letitia James and former FBI director James Comey (prosecutions currently paused due to Trump administration <a data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2025/11/25/james-comey-letitia-james-indictments-tossed-because-trumps-insurance-lawyer-wasnt-legally-appointed-to-the-doj/" data-type="link" href="https://www.techdirt.com/2025/11/25/james-comey-letitia-james-indictments-tossed-because-trumps-insurance-lawyer-wasnt-legally-appointed-to-the-doj/">fuckery/fuck ups</a>) can happen to anyone.</p>
<p>So here’s what happened to <a data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2025/04/28/fbi-arrests-wisconsin-judge-for-allegedly-obstructing-the-arrest-of-an-undocumented-immigrant/" data-type="link" href="https://www.techdirt.com/2025/04/28/fbi-arrests-wisconsin-judge-for-allegedly-obstructing-the-arrest-of-an-undocumented-immigrant/">Milwaukee County judge Hannah Dugan</a>. After being made aware of the fact that DEA and ICE agents were hanging around outside of her courtroom in hopes of arresting migrants who were doing nothing more than reporting for their court-ordered check-ins, Dugan decided to let the migrant whose criminal case she was currently handling slip out a side door, rather than go out the main door and directly into the hands of loitering federal officers.</p>
<p><a data-id="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25920037-dugan-charging/" data-type="link" href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25920037-dugan-charging/">According to the criminal complaint</a> filed by Kash Patel’s FBI — something <a data-id="https://www.jsonline.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/04/25/PMJS/83271892007-img-5923.PNG?width=300&amp;height=513&amp;fit=crop&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp" data-type="link" href="https://www.jsonline.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/04/25/PMJS/83271892007-img-5923.PNG?width=300&amp;height=513&amp;fit=crop&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp">he celebrated on X briefly</a> before deleting his post — this meant agents had to move quickly across nearly an additional 50-100 feet to arrest this person. A sworn affidavit by FBI special agent made it clear this was way too much stuff for officers to be doing, especially one with [checks affidavit again] seven years experience as a CPA[??][!!].</p>
<p>The federal government said this added up to obstruction. And it chose to criminally charge Judge Hannah Dugan rather than allow the Wisconsin court system to handle this on its own. There’s precedent for this, of course. The last time a judge faced criminal charges for acts that would normally be handled by the court system’s internal disciplinary procedures <a data-id="https://www.abajournal.com/news/article/judge-gave-reasonable-impression-she-was-letting-immigrant-evade-ice-ethics-charges-say#:~:text=joseph%20was%20suspended%20in%20april%202019%20as%20a%20result%20of%20the%20federal%20indictment%20but%20was%20reinstated%20after%20the%20federal%20charges%20were%20dropped%20in%202022%2C%20according%20to%20boston.com.%20she%20is%20currently%20a%20judge%20for%20the%20boston%20municipal%20court." data-type="link" href="https://www.abajournal.com/news/article/judge-gave-reasonable-impression-she-was-letting-immigrant-evade-ice-ethics-charges-say#:~:text=joseph%20was%20suspended%20in%20april%202019%20as%20a%20result%20of%20the%20federal%20indictment%20but%20was%20reinstated%20after%20the%20federal%20charges%20were%20dropped%20in%202022%2C%20according%20to%20boston.com.%20she%20is%20currently%20a%20judge%20for%20the%20boston%20municipal%20court.">was in 2019 during Trump’s first term as president</a>.</p>
<p>No doubt people like Kash Patel and Pam Bondi will be celebrating this latest abuse of the justice system. The FBI and DOJ have managed to turn a <a data-id="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/18/us/judge-hannah-dugan-trial-verdict.html" data-type="link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/18/us/judge-hannah-dugan-trial-verdict.html">minor, momentary inconvenience into a federal felony conviction</a>.</p>
<blockquote> <p><em>Hannah C. Dugan, a Wisconsin state judge, was found guilty on Thursday of obstructing federal agents, a high-profile victory for the Justice Department in a prosecution of a judge who it said was illegally aiding an undocumented immigrant.</em></p> <p><em>Judge Dugan faces up to five years in prison and, as a person who has been convicted of a felony, she is likely <a href="https://law.justia.com/constitution/wisconsin/article-xiii/section-3/">ineligible</a> to continue to hold office as a judge in Wisconsin, according to the State Constitution.</em></p> </blockquote>
<p>This wasn’t the end result of a lengthy investigation or the culmination of numerous complaints against Judge Dugan. This is nothing more than some federal agents bitching that they were momentarily inconvenienced and getting all the vindictiveness they wanted from Trump’s DOJ and Kash Patel’s FBI.</p>
<p>This isn’t over. This conviction can be appealed. And it appears the court handling this thinks there’s a case to be made. Normally, jury guilty verdicts are accompanied by sentencing dates. <a data-id="https://archive.ph/f0EbM" data-type="link" href="https://archive.ph/f0EbM">That didn’t happen here</a>, which seems to indicate the judge handling the case isn’t necessarily convinced Judge Dugan’s actions rise to the level of a federal felony. But no matter how this ends up playing out, everyone should be on notice that Trump thinks “justice” and “revenge” are the same word.</p>
