<h3><strong>The TPUSA Convention Disaster</strong></h3>
<p>The leading lights of the conservative movement headed to Phoenix over the weekend for AmericaFest, Turning Point USA’s signature annual convention. But what was meant to be a celebration of slain founder Charlie Kirk soon dissolved in recriminations between Kirk’s former friends.</p>
<p>As things started to go south, Erika Kirk, Charlie Kirk’s widow, <a href="https://x.com/RedWave_Press/status/2002229248283803863">joked</a> that the conference was starting to feel like “a Thanksgiving dinner where your family’s hashing out the family business.” Who doesn’t love that! But judging by the cutting speeches at the event, this feels a bit more like the <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt26230386/">Christmas dinner</a> in <em>The Bear</em>.</p>
<p>Ben Shapiro <a href="https://x.com/realmikolson/status/2001827243098804383">kicked things off</a> on Thursday, responding to the wave of antisemitism and conspiracism that has been swamping the right for months. His targets included Candace Owens for suggesting Erika Kirk murdered her husband (“baseless trash”) and personalities like Megyn Kelly for condoning it (“cowardice”).

<p>“There is a reason that Charlie Kirk despised Nick Fuentes and indeed even chided Dinesh D’Souza for debating him,” Shapiro said. “He knew that Nick Fuentes is an evil troll and that building him up is an act of moral imbecility. And that is precisely what Tucker Carlson did. He built Nick Fuentes up, and he ought to take responsibility for that.”</p>
