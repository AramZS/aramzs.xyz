  Before she stoked outrage by spiking a ‘60 Minutes’ segment about a notorious

<p>“Dismal,” “confused,” “demoralized,” “super fucked.” That, as one reporter tells <em>Vanity Fair,</em> is the mood inside CBS News this week—all because of <strong><a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/bari-weiss-gets-to-work-at-cbs">Bari Weiss</a>,</strong> about 14 minutes of television that criticized the Trump administration, and a Canadian streaming service, of all things.</p>
<p>Over the weekend, CBS News’ <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/bari-weiss-cbs-hollywood-reaction?srsltid=AfmBOoov5GvvHeiknhWJ7Ke7oI5yJC3uIy9EHWAhXG-BxGLYSzirUDgE">controversial</a> new editor in chief abruptly pulled a <em>60 Minutes</em> segment featuring interviews with several Venezuelan migrants sent by the Trump administration to CECOT, a notorious prison in El Salvador, without trial. Her decision caused an uproar both inside the network and online. Then the report was mistakenly uploaded by a Canadian network—allowing anyone with Wi-Fi to see the segment Weiss had tried to shelve. “I mean, it’s already out there, so now we just look like idiots,” the CBS reporter tells me. (A representative for CBS News did not respond to <em>Vanity Fair</em>’s request for comment.)</p>
<p>The controversy is the latest in a series of hurdles for CBS News under Weiss, who was handpicked by new Paramount Skydance boss <strong>David Ellison</strong> to serve as the outlet’s editor in chief earlier this year after Paramount acquired <em>The Free Press,</em> a successful digital media start-up she cofounded. Before announcing a new CBS <a data-event-boundary="click" data-event-click='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-in-view='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-include-experiments="true" data-offer-url="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/cbs-news-town-halls-bari-weiss-continue-bank-america-1236611702/" href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/cbs-news-town-halls-bari-weiss-continue-bank-america-1236611702/">town hall and debate series</a>, Weiss, according to two sources, spent weeks lobbying <strong>Megyn Kelly</strong> to participate in a debate on feminism with <em>Call Her Daddy</em> host <strong>Alex Cooper,</strong> to no avail. This was before Weiss promoted <strong>Ben Shapiro</strong>’s <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/megyn-kelly-ben-shapiro-americafest-maga">broadside against Kelly</a> at Turning Point’s annual conference, triggering a searing response from the conservative commentator.</p>
<p>“Bari, for all of her proselytizing about how bad cancel culture is, has not been canceled,” Kelly told me in an interview over the weekend. “She’s only ever been given opportunity after opportunity. And as she gets more powerful, she wants more and more censorship on her signature issue, which is Israel.”</p>

<p>CBS announced that the CECOT segment would not run just hours before <em>60 Minutes</em> was set to air on Sunday night. In a scathing internal memo, <strong>Sharyn Alfonsi,</strong> the longtime <em>60 Minutes</em> correspondent who reported the segment, objected to the decision. “Our story was screened five times and cleared by both CBS attorneys and Standards and Practices,” <a data-event-boundary="click" data-event-click='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-in-view='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-include-experiments="true" data-offer-url="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/21/business/60-minutes-trump-bari-weiss.html" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/21/business/60-minutes-trump-bari-weiss.html">she wrote</a> in the Sunday memo—which was quickly leaked to several media reporters—per <em>The New York Times.</em> “It is factually correct. In my view, pulling it now, after every rigorous internal check has been met, is not an editorial decision, it is a political one.”</p>
<p>In a different <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/12/22/60-minutes-bari-weiss-cecot">memo</a> sent to <em>60 Minutes</em> leadership on Sunday, Weiss argued, per <em>Axios,</em> that the piece was not ready. “At present, we do not present the administration’s argument for why it sent 252 Venezuelans to CECOT,” she wrote.</p>
<p>The segment that aired in Canada featured sound bites from White House press secretary <strong>Karoline Leavitt,</strong> President <strong>Donald Trump,</strong> and Secretary of Homeland Security <strong>Kristi Noem.</strong> In it, Alfonsi said the Department of Homeland Security “declined our request for an interview and referred all questions about CECOT to El Salvador. The government there did not respond to our request.”</p>
<p>Critics of Weiss have argued that it’s not clear what further comment from the administration would add. Trump officials have refused to say what specific crimes the men sent to CECOT committed. Leavitt said from the White House that the men were “heinous monsters, rapists, murderers, kidnappers, sexual assaulters, predators”—but according to Alfonsi’s reporting, at least 48.8% of the men had no criminal history. Internal DHS data reported by <a data-event-boundary="click" data-event-click='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-in-view='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-include-experiments="true" data-offer-url="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/05/30/trump-el-salvador-deportees-criminal-convictions-cecot-venezuela/" href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/05/30/trump-el-salvador-deportees-criminal-convictions-cecot-venezuela/"><em>The Texas Tribune</em></a> earlier this year showed that the US government knew the “vast majority” of Venezuelans sent to CECOT “had not been convicted of crimes in the United States before it labeled them as terrorists and deported them.”</p>
<p>At a <em>60 Minutes</em> staff meeting on Monday, <strong>Scott Pelley</strong> criticized Weiss for the last-minute decision, made after she had missed several earlier screenings of the segment. “It’s not a part-time job,” Pelley said, <a data-event-boundary="click" data-event-click='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-in-view='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-include-experiments="true" data-offer-url="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/22/business/media/cbs-news-bari-weiss-60-minutes.html" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/22/business/media/cbs-news-bari-weiss-60-minutes.html">according to the <em>Times</em></a><em>,</em> which spoke to several people with knowledge of the conversation. In the same meeting, per the <em>Times,</em> <em>60 Minutes</em> executive producer <strong>Tanya Simon</strong> said she stood “100% behind” Alfonsi and her story. “We pushed back, we defended our story, but she wanted changes, and I ultimately had to comply,” Simon reportedly <a data-event-boundary="click" data-event-click='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-in-view='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-include-experiments="true" data-offer-url="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/12/21/cbs-news-bari-weiss-intervention/" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/12/21/cbs-news-bari-weiss-intervention/">said</a>.</p>
<p>During the network’s editorial call on Monday morning, Weiss expressed frustration with this turn of events. “The only newsroom I’m interested in running is one in which we are able to have contentious disagreements about the thorniest editorial matters with respect and, crucially, where we assume the best intent of our colleagues,” she said. “Anything else is absolutely unacceptable.”</p>
<p>“It felt like she was accusing us of breaking the trust she had just broken with us,” the CBS News reporter tells me. They add that they were promised that Weiss would speak to the entire staff about the direction of the network before the end of the year; as of our conversation, though, she had not, aside from making her remarks on the network’s morning news call. “If she has an editorial vision, which apparently she says she has for this place, I think it’s about time for us to hear it.”</p>
<p>Weiss, an opinion writer before she founded <em>The Free Press</em>, lacked the experience in broadcast television typically expected from network newsroom chiefs, leading to fears, both inside and outside CBS, that her appointment was political—that she got the job because of her unwavering support for Israel, a cause important to the Ellison family, or to sate the Trump administration, which has exhibited a voracious appetite for cracking down on media outlets the president doesn’t like.</p>
<p>In her time running the newsroom at the so-called Tiffany Network, Weiss has had a hands-on approach, helping with bookings and even hosting duties. She named <strong>Tony Dokoupil,</strong> a hero in the pages of <em>The Free Press,</em> as anchor of <em>CBS</em> <em>Evening News,</em> the network’s flagship nightly program. She announced the town hall and debate series, the result of a partnership between CBS News and <em>The Free Press,</em> which will air in 2026. Weiss hosted a town hall with <strong>Erika Kirk,</strong> the widow of Charlie Kirk, which <a data-event-boundary="click" data-event-click='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-in-view='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-include-experiments="true" data-offer-url="https://www.forbes.com/sites/maryroeloffs/2025/12/16/erika-kirk-town-hall-looks-like-a-flop-for-cbs-and-bari-weiss/" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/maryroeloffs/2025/12/16/erika-kirk-town-hall-looks-like-a-flop-for-cbs-and-bari-weiss/">performed poorly in the ratings</a>. Upcoming town halls will feature participants including Vice President <strong>JD Vance</strong> and OpenAI chief <strong>Sam Altman,</strong> while debates will feature commentators like <strong>Liz Plank</strong> and <strong>Allie Beth Stuckey,</strong> who will assess whether feminism has “failed women.”</p>
<p>The hurdle for Weiss’s leadership at CBS News comes as Paramount mounts a hostile takeover bid for Warner Bros. Discovery, the media conglomerate that owns CNN and HBO. The Warner board, which agreed to an $82.7 billion acquisition from Netflix, has been fighting back. It’s rejected the Paramount bid multiple times, prompting Paramount to <a data-event-boundary="click" data-event-click='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-in-view='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-include-experiments="true" data-offer-url="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/12/22/media/paramount-warner-bros-ellisons-revised-deal" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/12/22/media/paramount-warner-bros-ellisons-revised-deal">announce this week</a> that <strong>Larry Ellison,</strong> the father of Paramount chief David Ellison, would personally guarantee $40 billion to bankroll the deal. The announcement came soon after Weiss spiked the CECOT story, raising the eyebrows of critics like Senator <strong>Elizabeth Warren:</strong> “Paramount needs Trump’s backing to buy Warner Bros. — including CNN,” <a data-event-boundary="click" data-event-click='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-in-view='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-include-experiments="true" data-offer-url="https://bsky.app/profile/warren.senate.gov/post/3malitilolc2b" href="https://bsky.app/profile/warren.senate.gov/post/3malitilolc2b">she wrote on Bluesky</a>. “Is that just a coincidence? This looks like corruption.”</p>
<p>Despite the pressure, the Warner board seems to be standing firm. “The Board is not modifying its recommendation with respect to the Netflix Merger Agreement,” the company said <a data-event-boundary="click" data-event-click='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-in-view='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-include-experiments="true" data-offer-url="https://ir.wbd.com/news-and-events/financial-news/financial-news-details/2025/Warner-Bros--Discovery-Confirms-Receipt-of-Amended-Unsolicited-Tender-Offer-from-Paramount-Skydance/default.aspx" href="https://ir.wbd.com/news-and-events/financial-news/financial-news-details/2025/Warner-Bros--Discovery-Confirms-Receipt-of-Amended-Unsolicited-Tender-Offer-from-Paramount-Skydance/default.aspx">in a press release</a> on Monday.</p>
<p>There are also signs that Trump might not favor the Ellisons in their hostile bid. “For those people that think I am close with the new owners of CBS, please understand that <em>60 Minutes</em> has treated me far worse since the so-called ‘takeover,’ than they have ever treated me before,” Trump <a data-event-boundary="click" data-event-click='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-in-view='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-include-experiments="true" data-offer-url="https://deadline.com/2025/12/trump-60-minutes-paramount-david-ellison-1236650369/" href="https://deadline.com/2025/12/trump-60-minutes-paramount-david-ellison-1236650369/">recently wrote on Truth Social</a>. “If they are friends, I’d hate to see my enemies!”</p>
