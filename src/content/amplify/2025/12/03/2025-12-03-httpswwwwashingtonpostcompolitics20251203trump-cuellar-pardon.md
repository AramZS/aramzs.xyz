Henry Cuellar (D-Texas) was charged last year. (Eric Gay/AP)</figcaption></figure><p>President Donald Trump on Wednesday said he will pardon Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar of Texas, unexpectedly ending the prosecution of a member of the opposite party.</p><p>Cuellar, one of the most conservative Democrats in the House, was charged last year with <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/05/03/henry-cuellar-indicted-bribery-azerbaijan-mexico/">bribery, money laundering and conspiracy</a>. Trump also pardoned Cuellar’s wife, Imelda, who also had been charged. He and his wife were scheduled to stand trial in April for the combined dozen charges. The 54-page indictment of Henry and Imelda Cuellar detailed a bold corruption scheme in which Cuellar allegedly promised to wield his power as a U.S. congressman to advocate for his benefactors.</p><p>Cuellar said in a statement after the indictment that he and his wife were innocent.</p><p>“Everything I have done in Congress has been to serve the people of South Texas,” the statement added.</p><p>In his post shared Wednesday morning on Truth Social, Trump baselessly accused the Biden administration of weaponizing the justice system against “anyone who disagreed with them” — including Cuellar.</p><p class="rw-outer-content"><span>Some content could not be imported from the original document.</span> <a href="https://washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/12/03/trump-cuellar-pardon/">View content ↗ </a></p><p>“Crooked Joe used the FBI and DOJ to ‘take out’ a member of his own Party after Highly Respected Congressman Henry Cuellar bravely spoke out against Open Borders, and the Biden Border ‘Catastrophe,’” Trump wrote in his post.</p><p>While Cuellar is a Democrat, he repeatedly <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/03/08/border-democrat-wants-seize-back-debate-immigration/">criticized </a>the Biden administration’s immigration policies.</p><p>The investigation into Cuellar began in 2022, and federal authorities alleged that the congressman and his wife <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/05/03/henry-cuellar-indicted-bribery-azerbaijan-mexico/">accepted hundreds of thousands</a> of dollars for advancing the interests of an energy company controlled by the Azerbaijan government and a bank headquartered in Mexico.</p><p>While the investigation into Cuellar was independently run by the Justice Department, in his Wednesday post, Trump — who has often accused his opponents of weaponizing the justice system against him — said the investigation was “unAmerican” and he accused Democrats of being willing to “attack, rob, lie, cheat, destroy, and decimate anyone who dares to oppose their Far Left Agenda.”</p></body></html>
