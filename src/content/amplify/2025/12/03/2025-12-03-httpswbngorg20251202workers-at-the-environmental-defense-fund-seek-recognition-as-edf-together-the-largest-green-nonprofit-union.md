<p>WASHINGTON — Today, workers at the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) announced the formation of their union, “EDF Together,” which will represent nearly 500 workers. They are proud to have submitted a supermajority of union authorization cards from union-eligible staff and hope to receive voluntary recognition from EDF’s Executive Management Team, following in the footsteps of close partners Natural Resources Defense Council Union, League of Conservation Voters Union, and thousands of other workers represented by the Washington-Baltimore News Guild.</p>
<p>EDF Together’s mission is to champion the rights, well-being, and collective voice of workers at EDF. Members seek to strengthen collaboration across the organization and ensure their relationships are effective, equitable, and rooted in trust. EDF works to advance environmental solutions for a just and livable world, and forming this union will empower staff to enhance that work at a critical time. The climate crisis demands the kind of bold action that EDF takes every day, and they as workers know that collective action is the most effective kind.</p>
<p>“Our union is a labor of love — workers have had thousands of conversations about ways to continuously improve our workplace, all because of a heartfelt commitment to EDF’s mission, its staff, and its longevity. If you ask any EDFer about their favorite thing about our workplace, they’ll say it’s the people. EDF Together is about the people.” — Sophie, Federal Affairs</p>
<p>“Democracy and climate action are inextricably intertwined with nearly 75% of Americans supporting climate action and the kind of work we do at EDF. And in an era when democracy is under attack, unionizing allows us to build more democracy into our day-to-day lives and gives workers a meaningful seat at the decision-making table.” — Sam, Project Manager</p>
<p>“To fight for clean air, a livable planet, and a healthy future, workers in environmental advocacy like EDF must feel supported and included in their workplace. Our union supports a culture where all employees can bring their new ideas and bold solutions to the table.” — Neda, Attorney</p>
<p>EDF has proudly supported unions through coalition partnerships and has reiterated its commitment to improving staff experiences. The unit looks forward to Executive Management Team exemplifying this commitment to workplace democracy by voluntarily recognizing the union.</p>
<p>EDF Together is proud that a supermajority of union-eligible EDFers signed union authorization cards, a widely recognized and efficient way to signal workers’ choice to form a union. EDF Together is eager to work alongside the Executive Management Team to inspire others across the growing — and interconnected — environment and labor movements.</p>
