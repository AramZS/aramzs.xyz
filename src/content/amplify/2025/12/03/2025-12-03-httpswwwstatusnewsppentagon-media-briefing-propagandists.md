<p>On Tuesday morning, as the <strong>Pete Hegseth</strong>–led <strong>Defense Department </strong>remained ensnared in scandal over its lethal “double-tap” airstrike in the <strong>Caribbean</strong>, press secretary <strong>Kingsley Wilson </strong>strode onstage in the <strong>Pentagon</strong> press briefing room and took her place behind the podium. “Welcome to the Department of War,” the 20-something said, using the administration’s preferred terminology.</p>
<p>“I would like to take a moment today,” Wilson continued, “to welcome all of you to the Pentagon briefing room as official new members of the Pentagon press corps.” But rather than opening the briefing with a response to the deadly boat strikes roiling the department and its leadership, she used the platform to attack the press. “Legacy media chose to self-deport from this building,” she falsely asserted after every major news organization, including <strong>Fox News</strong>, was barred from the Pentagon in October for refusing to sign unprecedented restrictions on reporting.</p>
<p>“The American people don’t trust these propagandists because they stopped telling the truth,” declared Wilson, who was appointed to her position despite a <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/dod-deputy-press-secretary-history-tweets-racist-antisemitic-conspirac-rcna195005">lengthy online record</a> of advancing antisemitic and bigoted conspiracy theories. “So we’re not going to beg these old gatekeepers to come back. And we’re not rebuilding a broken model just to appease them. Instead we are welcoming new media outlets that actually reach Americans, ask real questions, and don’t pursue a biased agenda.”</p>
<p>Wilson delivered her prepared remarks with a straight face, though even she surely knows they were entirely untethered from reality. Indeed, as she smeared journalists at legacy outlets as “propagandists,” the people assembled before her were…</p>

<p><strong><em>Nuzzi's Narrative:</em></strong><strong> Olivia Nuzzi</strong> broke her silence Tuesday while promoting her new book,<strong> “American Canto,”</strong> blasting her ex-fiancé <strong>Ryan Lizza </strong>for writing what she described as “violating fan fiction-slash-revenge porn.” (Lizza responded in a Q&amp;A with his <strong>Substack</strong> followers that “telling the truth is not harassment.”) Nuzzi first <a href="https://www.readfeedme.com/p/olivia-nuzzi-answers-your-questions">participated in a Q&amp;A</a> with subscribers of <strong>Emily Sundberg’s Feed Me </strong>newsletter, where she flatly stated that she does not believe <strong>Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</strong> is doing a good job as <strong>HHS</strong> secretary and that she has no plans to return to the campaign trail as a political journalist. Nuzzi also penned a list outlining “signs your book rollout has gone awry,” including that “<strong>Monica Lewinsky</strong> reaches out to check on your mental health.”</p>
<p>Later, Nuzzi appeared on <strong>Tim Miller’s Bulwark </strong>podcast, which turned out to be a largely sympathetic venue. Miller did, however, press her on why she didn’t speak out during Kennedy’s confirmation hearing— a question she never fully answered, reiterating only that…</p>
