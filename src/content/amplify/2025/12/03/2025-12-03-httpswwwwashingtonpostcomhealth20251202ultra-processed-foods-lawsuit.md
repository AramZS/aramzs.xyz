<p>Makers of popular drinks, snacks and cereals that fill store shelves and pantries across the nation are facing legal heat again.</p>
<p>San Francisco’s city attorney filed a <a href="https://sfcityattorney.org/san-francisco-city-attorney-chiu-sues-largest-manufacturers-of-ultra-processed-foods/">first-of-its-kind government lawsuit</a> on Tuesday against some of the country’s largest manufacturers of ultra-processed food, accusing the companies of making and selling products that are harmful to people’s health.
