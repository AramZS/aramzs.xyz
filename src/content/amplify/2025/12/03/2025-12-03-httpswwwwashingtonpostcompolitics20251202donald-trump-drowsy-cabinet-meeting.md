  Trump appears drowsy in Cabinet meeting, repeatedly closing his eyes - The
  Washington Post

<p>It was the second time in a month Trump has appeared to struggle to stay awake as his advisers have spoken to cameras about the administration’s initiatives.</p>
<p>President Donald Trump closed his eyes for extended periods as Cabinet officials went around the room Tuesday providing updates on their work, at times seeming to nod off.</p>
<p>It was the second time in less than a month that Trump has appeared to struggle to stay awake as his advisers speak about the administration’s initiatives. A Washington Post analysis of multiple video feeds of the meeting Tuesday showed that during nine separate instances, Trump’s eyes were closed for extended periods or he appeared to struggle to keep them open, amounting cumulatively to nearly six minutes. The episode was similar to an Oval Office event on Nov. 6 when the president spent nearly 20 minutes <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/11/08/trump-sleeping-oval-office/">battling to keep his eyes open</a>.</p>
