title: Blacksky Algorithms Announces One-Click PDS Deployment Coming Soon
---
<p><a href="https://blackskyweb.xyz/anniversary/">Rudy Fraser</a>, founder and CEO of <a href="https://blackskyweb.xyz/overview/">Blacksky</a>, made two big announcements on the occasion of it being the first anniversary of its launch. The first is online cash payments in USD, which I am a little unclear about, but relies in part on the trust implicit in AT Protocol connections.</p>
<p>The second, though, is easier for me to understand:</p>
<blockquote> <p>As Mozilla has been saying, we need to <a href="https://blacksky.community/profile/did:plc:jxrrsbtaptoynkhm2tdvxohg/post/3maly6tgzoi2i">decentralize the internet</a>. Decentralization necessarily requires running your own servers and as mentioned above by Moxie, founder of the beloved Signal protocol, <strong>no one wants to run their own servers, and never will.</strong> If you take seriously that both are true, how do you square the two?</p> <p>I’m excited to say: promises made, promises kept. Clinton has built a mobile-friendly web app that will allow users to create a new PDS [Personal Data Server] that is truly one-click and will be hosted on Blacksky’s infrastructure. […]</p> </blockquote>
<p>I am intrigued by the possibility of announcements like this one. It offers a meaningful layer of self-governance beyond monolithic social platforms, made possible only by open standards like AT Protocol and the rival ActivityPub.</p>
