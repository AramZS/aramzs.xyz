  Exclusive: Woman detained by feds in Keys says she was following agents’
  orders
---
<p>The woman in medical scrubs who was forcibly yanked from her car while on her way to work in Key Largo, screaming she was a U.S. citizen, said Friday she had obeyed the federal agents’ commands to roll down her window and the story immigration officials told was “completely false.”</p>
<p>“To clarify, I did roll down my window the moment they pulled me over, and any claim saying that I refused to do so is completely false,” the woman wrote in a detailed statement about the incident to the Miami Herald. “In the video of the incident, you can clearly see my windows rolled down as they opened my door, which further proves that I complied from the start.”</p>
<p>The woman, who is a behavioral therapist and was dressed in green medical scrubs, was on her way to work when the masked agents dragged her from her car at about 9:15 a.m. Wednesday. They had pulled her over to the southbound lanes of U.S. 1 in front of the Pink Plaza shopping center at mile marker 103.4 in Key Largo.</p>
<p>She is just shy of 5 feet tall and weighs 85 pounds, she said.</p>
<p><b><a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/florida-keys/article313356223.html#storylink=cpy">READ MORE: ‘I’m a U.S. citizen.’ Agents pull woman from car in Keys. Feds said she wouldn’t show ID</a></b></p>
<p>“Before I could even reach for my driver’s license, the individuals surrounding my vehicle threatened to break my window, creating fear and pressure instead of allowing me a moment to comply. Their tone and actions made it extremely difficult to remain calm or feel safe.”</p>
<p>The Herald is not publishing the woman’s name over concerns about her privacy. The Herald independently verified her name and that she is the woman who was pulled over by agents with U.S. Customs and Border Protection and CBP’s Air and Marine Operations in Key Largo.</p>
<p>Her statement is the first time she told her version of the incident, which has gained international attention and outrage after the Herald posted its video from the scene on its website.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for Customs and Border Patrol told a Miami Herald reporter on Wednesday that the woman had refused to roll down her window initially, and after she did, refused to hand over her driver’s license. The Herald reporter was on the scene and filmed the incident.</p>
<p>When asked about the woman’s version of events Friday, a Customs and Border Protection spokesperson declined to comment.</p>
<p>She says she’s been stopped twice before for immigration inspections in the same area; federal agents have ratcheted up immigration traffic stops in the Key Largo area over the past few weeks.</p>
<p>But on Wednesday it was different. The agents yanked her from her white Toyota and threatened to break her window while she was reaching for her license, she said. The agents then hoisted her up and carried her over to a grassy area while she kicked and screamed and was later handcuffed.</p>
<h2>‘Snatched my phone from my hand’</h2>
<p>“I’m a U.S. citizen. Please help me! This is unfair. Why are you doing this to me?” she yelled as passing drivers watched.</p>
<p>“From the very beginning of the encounter, there was clear intimidation,” the healthcare worker wrote.</p>
<p>She says that the agents were masked and never identified themselves, heightening her “fear, confusion and sense of danger.”</p>
<p>She rolled down her window, and was intending to comply, but the agents unlocked her car door and yanked her out of the car while she was reaching for her license, according to the statement.</p>
<p>They “dragged me out of my vehicle aggressively, snatched my phone from my hand, and handcuffed me,” she wrote.</p>
<p>“Being surrounded by masked, unidentified men was terrifying. I have seen many incidents online of people impersonating law enforcement, and in that moment, I panicked. My body began shaking, and I went into severe anxiety and possibly a panic attack, genuinely afraid for my safety,” she wrote.</p>
<p>She was detained in an unmarked Ford SUV and watched as the agents looked through her belongings, including her purse, which she says she did not consent to, until they found her license. Once they verified she was a U.S. citizen, they released her.</p>
<h2>‘Unreasonable search and seizure’: attorney</h2>
<p>“None of that is legal,” said Magdalena Cuprys, a South Florida immigration attorney, after a Herald reporter recounted the woman’s testimony. “If you’re within 100 miles of a border, which in theory in the Keys you are, they do have a right to ask you for citizenship documents or for legal status, but they still don’t have a right to go into your car, into your purse. That’s an unreasonable search and seizure.”</p>
<p>The Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution says a search warrant is needed, based on probable cause, to search a person, their house or their documents.</p>
<p>The woman’s sister, who also shared a statement with the Herald, called the incident “a complete overstepping on human rights and dignity.”</p>
<p>Customs and Border Protection said in a statement that agents arrested 14 undocumented immigrants during Wednesday’s operation. The agency announced last week that a previous operation in the Keys conducted earlier in the month resulted in the arrest of 12 people.</p>
<p>In the days following the event, the woman says she hasn’t been able to sleep, is in physical pain from the way she was handled by the agents, and keeps reliving what happened.</p>
<p>“The way I was treated left me feeling traumatized, humiliated, degraded, and unheard,” she wrote.</p>
<p>“I want to make something absolutely clear: This is not the America that I grew up in, and this is not the America that we represent. I refuse to allow anyone — identified or not— to violate my rights or strip away my dignity.”</p>
<h5>These are the full statements from the two women</h5>
<h5>From the essential healthcare worker detained in Key Largo on Wednesday, December 3rd</h5>
<p>"I am the essential healthcare worker who was detained in Key Largo on Wednesday, December 3rd while on my way to work, and I want to correct the false narrative currently being shared. <br/>
 From the very beginning of the encounter, there was clear intimidation. To clarify, I did roll down my window the moment they pulled me over, and any claim saying that I refused to do so is completely false. In the video of the incident, you can clearly see my windows rolled down as they opened my door, which further proves that I complied from the start. Before I could even reach for my driver’s license, the individuals surrounding my vehicle threatened to break my window, creating fear and pressure instead of allowing me a moment to comply. Their tone and actions made it extremely difficult to remain calm or feel safe. <br/>
 During the encounter, the individuals who stopped me unlocked my car door without my consent, dragged me out of my vehicle aggressively, snatched my phone from my hand, and handcuffed me. They placed me inside their car, and while I was restrained, I watched them search through my personal belongings—including my purse—without my consent. I know I have the right to not consent to a search, yet my rights were not respected. <br/>
 I also want to state that they never identified themselves. Bystanders were unsure—some believed they might be federal agents, others said police, and others said ICE—but the individuals themselves never told me who they were, and their vehicle had no visible identification. They were also wearing masks, which heightened my fear, confusion, and sense of danger. <br/>
 Being surrounded by masked, unidentified men was terrifying. I have seen many incidents online of people impersonating law enforcement, and in that moment, I panicked. My body began shaking, and I went into severe anxiety and possibly a panic attack, genuinely afraid for my safety. <br/>
 This incident was especially distressing because it was the third time I had been stopped in the same area for what they called an “immigration inspection.” I explained this history to them and clearly repeated that I am a U.S. citizen. After they forcibly removed me, restrained me, and searched my belongings, they eventually verified that I am, in fact, a U.S. citizen, and only then did they hand my license back to me before releasing me. <br/>
 Since this incident, I haven’t been able to sleep well at night. I keep reliving what happened, and the fear stays with me. My arms are in significant pain, and my entire body hurts from the way I was handled. The physical pain and emotional distress have made it extremely difficult to return to work or feel safe on the road again. <br/>
 Despite confirming my citizenship, the way I was treated left me feeling traumatized, humiliated, degraded, and unheard. As someone who is 4’11” and 85 pounds, the level of force used against me was overwhelming and unnecessary. <br/>
 I want to make something absolutely clear: This is not the America that I grew up in, and this is not the America that we represent. I refuse to allow anyone—identified or not—to violate my rights or strip away my dignity. <br/>
 I would like to thank the community, the people around me, and everyone who has stood up, spoken up, and shown support during this incredibly painful experience. Your voices, your compassion, and your solidarity mean more to me than I can express. <br/>
 I still believe in this country, in our values, and in the people who fight for what is right. <br/>
 God bless America.”</p>
<h5>From the woman's sister</h5>
<p>This is my sister, yes a U.S CITIZEN, shame on them!!!! this is kidnapping at its best. <br/>
 No name, no badge number, face covered, dragging her out of her car, and shoving her into an SUV!!! <br/>
 they snatched the cell phone out of her hand, looked through her purse. she clearly told them that she did not consent to that. <br/>
 She’s a behavioral therapist, on her way to work (wearing her scrubs) <br/>
 This is humiliating, traumatizing and a complete over stepping on human rights and dignity. <br/>
 by the way, she is 4’11. <br/>
 shame, shame,shame!!!!! to say the VERY least. They confirmed her identity and the fact that she is a rightful U.S Citizen once they went through her purse without her consent and found her valid I.D/ driver’s license. <br/>
 These are “men” in a tremendous power trip. <br/>
 We are devastated as a family. She is not well! She is having panic attacks, and very scared. <br/>
 It breaks my heart as her sister to see these images and that she had to go through such a humiliating, traumatic event all on her own. <br/>
 I love her dearly! <br/>
 I want to say thank you to everyone who has expressed their sympathy and concern, regarding the situation. <br/>
 This is the greatest country in the world! A country that is rooted on human rights and justice! <br/>
 Let’s not forget that. <br/>
 God bless America.</p>
