<p><a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://people.com/person/sydney-sweeney/">Sydney Sweeney</a> is addressing her highly publicized American Eagle denim ad in an emotional interview with PEOPLE.</p>
<p>Sweeney came under scrutiny for the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://people.com/sydney-sweeney-american-eagle-ad-explained-11781702">denim brand's hotly debated campaign</a> titled, <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" href="https://www.facebook.com/americaneagle/videos/1136711328284537/">"Sydney Sweeney Has Great Jeans,"</a> which was released on July 23.</p>
<p>The campaign sparked a debate that the usage of the word "jeans" as a play on "genes" is racially charged and hints at genetic superiority. Others criticized it for catering to the male gaze and taking inspiration from Brooke Shields' controversial 1980 denim campaign.</p>
<p>"I was honestly surprised by the reaction," Sweeney tells PEOPLE. "I did it because I love the jeans and love the brand. I don’t support the views some people chose to connect to the campaign. Many have assigned motives and labels to me that just aren’t true."</p>

<p>Shortly after the ad dropped, <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://people.com/american-eagle-responds-sydney-sweeney-denim-campaign-11780538">American Eagle took to social media to stand its ground</a> in response to all the online chatter. In an Aug. 1 <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DM0tMjaTBll/">Instagram</a>, the brand wrote, "'Sydney Sweeney Has Great Jeans' is and always was about the jeans. Her jeans. Her story. We'll continue to celebrate how everyone wears their AE jeans with confidence, their way. Great jeans look good on everyone."</p>
<p>Sweeney tells PEOPLE she's someone who "leads with kindness," and that she is addressing the campaign backlash to clarify her stance and dispel negativity.</p>
<p>"Anyone who knows me knows that I’m always trying to bring people together. I’m against hate and divisiveness," she says. "In the past my stance has been to never respond to negative or positive press but recently I have come to realize that my silence regarding this issue has only widened the divide, not closed it. So I hope this new year brings more focus on what connects us instead of what divides us."</p>
<p>The actress first <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://people.com/sydney-sweeney-breaks-silence-american-eagle-campaign-controversy-11843017">broke her silence</a> on the campaign in an interview with <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" href="https://www.gq.com/story/sydney-sweeney-gq-cover-story-interview-men-of-the-year-2025"><em>GQ </em>for its "Men of the Year" cover story</a> published on Nov. 4.</p>
<p>When asked by <em>GQ</em> if she was surprised by the reaction of the American Eagle ad, Sweeney answered directly.</p>
<p>"I did a jean ad. I mean, the reaction definitely was a surprise, but I love jeans. All I wear are jeans. I’m literally in jeans and a T-shirt every day of my life," she responded.</p>

<p>Despite the debate surrounding the campaign, American Eagle reported that the denim Sweeney was promoting sold well. In fact, pieces sold out.</p>
<p>Weeks after the launch on July 23, a press email from the brand stated that it saw record-breaking numbers, with a double-digit increase in men's and women’s denim. Per the retailer, the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" href="https://www.ae.com/us/en/p/women/jackets-vests/jackets-vests/ae-x-sydney-sweeney-cinched-waist-denim-jacket/0383_3791_915">Sydney Jacket</a> worn by Sweeney in the campaign sold out in one day, while the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" href="https://www.ae.com/us/en/p/women/baggy-wide-leg-jeans/baggy-wide-leg-jeans/ae-x-sydney-sweeney-ultra-wide-leg-jean/0437_5959_471">Sydney Jean</a>, the actress' custom Dreamy Drape style with 100% of proceeds benefiting the Crisis Text Line, sold out in one week.</p>
<p>Right now, Sweeney is busy promoting her upcoming film <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://people.com/the-housemaid-trailer-sydney-sweeney-amanda-seyfried-11706623"><em>The Housemaid</em></a>, directed by Paul Feig and adapted from Freida McFadden's 2022 bestselling novel.</p>
<p>She says some of her favorite set memories involve bonding with co-star Amanda Seyfried.</p>
<p>"One that is special to me was the time Amanda crocheted me this bag that is now my favorite bag ever," Sweeney says. "She would crochet on set all the time and she had made her own really cute bags, so when we wrapped she made me one."</p>
<p>Sweeney adds that the pair empowered each other by "showing up for one another" while filming, "each giving 100%."</p>
<p>"We both are similar in we always are giving positive energy to everyone, cast and crew," she says. "But most of all just having fun."</p>

<p><strong>What does a typical day off entail for you? </strong><br/>
 "It usually entails some sort of adventure outside, whether I’m jumping out of a plane, or water skiing, or going rock climbing. There’s also some arts and crafts activity, my best friend Kelley and I have many half way done projects we need to finish. Then I try to also fit in a solid core class, and end it with cuddles with my dog."</p>
<p><strong>Do you have any fun holiday traditions that you are most looking forward to?</strong><br/>
 "My entire family gets matching onesies and we stack on top of each other like a pyramid and take a picture together. It’s been fun to watch it grow wider and taller every year as cousins get spouses and have kids."</p>
<p><strong>What’s most important to you when it comes to maintaining a healthy work/life balance?</strong><br/>
 "Honestly, I haven’t figured out a healthy work life balance yet. I’m a work in progress."</p>
<p><strong>What makes you happiest?</strong><br/>
 "Love, family and friends."<br/>
<strong><br/>
 What are you most grateful for?</strong><br/>
 "That my grandparents are still with me."</p>
<p><strong>Any New Year’s resolutions?</strong><br/>
 "You know this past year I have tried to be strong but it’s been really hard at times. I think this next year I want to be really intentional with showing people who I am and what I want, cause so many people can just get it wrong."</p>
<p><em>The Housemaid</em> is in theaters Dec. 19.</p>
