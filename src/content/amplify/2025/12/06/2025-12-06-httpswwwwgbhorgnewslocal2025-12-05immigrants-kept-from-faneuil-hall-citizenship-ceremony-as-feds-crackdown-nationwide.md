<p>Becoming a U.S. citizen takes years and involves immigrants acquiring a green card, extensive interviews, background checks, classes and a citizenship test. The naturalization ceremony is the final step to the process, where the oath of allegiance and a citizenship certificate are granted.</p>
<p>Immigrants approved to be naturalized went to Faneuil Hall Thursday — known as the country’s cradle of liberty — for that long-awaited moment to pledge allegiance to the United States. But instead, as they lined up, some were told by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services officials that they couldn’t proceed due to their countries of origin.</p>
<p>The same situation is playing out at naturalization events across the country as USCIS <a data-cms-ai="0" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-administration-halts-immigration-citizenship-for-19-countries/">directed its employees</a> to halt adjudicating all immigration pathways for people from 19 countries deemed to be <a data-cms-ai="0" href="https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/document/policy-alerts/PM-602-0192-PendingApplicationsHighRiskCountries-20251202.pdf">“high risk”</a>.</p>
<p>“One of our clients said that she had gone to her oath ceremony because she hadn’t received the cancellation notice in time,” said Gail Breslow, executive director of Project Citizenship. “She showed up as scheduled, and when she arrived, officers were asking everyone what country they were from, and if they said a certain country, they were told to step out of line and that their oath ceremonies were canceled.”</p>
<p>That client, a Haitian woman in her 50s, has had a green card since the early 2000s and started working with Project Citizenship in January. She declined an interview request through Breslow.</p>
<p>“People are devastated and they’re frightened,” Breslow told GBH News. “People were plucked out of line. They didn’t cancel the whole ceremony.”</p>
<p>She said many clients with upcoming ceremonies and USCIS appointments have received cancellations via an online portal. She shared an example of the <a data-cms-ai="0" href="https://cdn.grove.wgbh.org/94/e7/ca84b0dc4184a1db3b056509df7f/uscis-notice-of-oath-ceremony-cancellation.pdf">notices they’re receiving</a>, which provide no further guidance or instructions.</p>
<p>“One person was, you know, asking ... what did I do wrong? Why is this happening to me? And, you know, needed to be reassured that it wasn’t anything she had done. This wasn’t her fault,” Breslow said.</p>
<p>The ceremony, which usually involves immigrants having family and friends present to witness their life-changing moment, is usually presided over by a judge or a USCIS official. USCIS, and the agency it falls under — the Department of Homeland Security — have not returned direct requests for comment about the Faneuil Hall ceremony. USCIS issued a press release on Friday saying that is is launching a USCIS Vetting Center in Atlanta for immigration and naturalization processes.</p>
<p>“USCIS’ role in the nation’s immigration system has never been more critical. In the wake of several recent incidents of violence, including a foreign national attacking National Guard service members on U.S. soil, establishing this vetting center will give us more enhanced capabilities to safeguard national security and ensure public safety,” said USCIS Director Joseph B. Edlow in the statement.</p>
<p>Advocates are decrying the move.</p>
<p>“As an immigrant takes the oath of citizenship, it’s a reflection and recognition of the tremendous sacrifice of time, energy, and financial resources they have made in the hopes of becoming a full member of our community and nation,” said Elizabeth Sweet, Executive Director of MIRA Coalition. “To have that final step canceled is unnecessarily cruel and does nothing to make this country a safer place.”</p>
<p>The countries presently on the full travel ban list are Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen. Those on the partial ban list are Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela.</p>
