title: The Greatest Feeling in the World
---
<h3>Seven months with an electric bike. </h3>
<p>My dad told me, when I was six years old, that the greatest feeling in the world was loving me and my sister, which made me feel so sad for him — because if he really believed that, it meant he’d never graduated to getting his training wheels off his bike. I myself had gotten my training wheels off one entire year earlier, the only person in my kindergarten class to do so, which is how I knew that the actual best feeling in the world was the crunch of gravel under two knobby tires, the glory of the wind whipping your hair into nest of tangles, the thrill of pedaling as fast and far as your legs would go.</p>
<p>My first bike was a real hotrod: a Strawberry Shortcake 16” Air-Ride with a banana saddle, green and red handlebar streamers, and a basket with a lid where I kept my precious treasures (such as my She-Ra and Catra action figures, quarters I planned to turn into dollars for the book fair, my collection of tuxedos for my Ken doll, and all the adoption papers for my Pound Purries: Blair, Jo, and Tootie Tortie). One time I got off the school bus after kindergarten and no one was home, so I just hopped onto my training wheel-less bike and took off to my great-grandmother’s corner store, four miles away.</p>
<p>“No training wheels!” I’d sometimes remind our mail lady when she slowed down in front of our house. “I’m practically flying!”</p>
<p>She’d laugh, put our envelopes in the box, and holler, “Fly on, honey!” with her hand out the window as she drove off.</p>
<p>There was an ad in the window of our local sporting goods store that said “Merry BMXmas” and had a drawing of Santa Claus riding a Schwinn Phantom Scrambler through the starry winter sky, with a sack of presents thrown over his shoulder. The Phantom Scrambler had a black and gold gusseted frame, a real competition saddle, and handlebar breaks. I didn’t even know what it meant to covet thy neighbour’s ox before I saw that poster, but once I did, I knew I’d be forever breaking God’s holy tenth Commandment until I got my hands on a BMX bike.</p>
<p>My dad said the Schwinn Phantom Scrambler was a rich kid’s ride (”The price isn’t even on the poster!”). My mom said I couldn’t have it even if it was not a rich kid’s ride (”Because ‘BMXmas’ is taking the ‘Christ’ out of ‘Christmas.’”). And my sister said not to lose hope, that BMXmas would find me one day (”But how?” “Magic!”).</p>
<p>I think it was my broken arm that convinced my dad I needed a big person bicycle, and also maybe convinced him that I was born into the world as an un-reformable misandrist lesbian.</p>
<p>He’d upgraded me to a pink Huffy Lil’ Chik we found at a yard sale for only ten dollars, when my knees started clanking into the handlebars of my Strawberry Shortcake Air-Ride, and then to a pink Huffy Sweet Thunder we put on layaway at Wal-Mart, when my legs continued to grow — as my Papa liked to say — “faster than a weed in manure.” The Huffy Sweet Thunder was almost (but not quite) big enough for me, which meant I couldn’t outrun the boys in my neighborhood on it, which led to a lot of boys getting walloped in their dumb faces. It was the Huffy Sweet Thunder I crashed when I broke my arm, but that wasn’t an actual problem because my cast simply became a boy-bonker that did better damage than my fist.</p>
<p>“You’ve been riding your bike, even though I told you not to, haven’t you?” my doctor asked, when he was sawing the cast off my arm, two months after I broke it.</p>
<p>I said, “Yeah.”</p>
<p>“Is it your blood all over this thing?” he asked.</p>
<p>I smiled, said, “No.”</p>
<p>That night my dad loaded us into the car and took us to a little piece of heaven called The Sports Authority, where I picked out a lime green and midnight black Diamond Back Viper. It looked like poison.</p>
<p>No boy ever caught up to me again.</p>
<p>I started naming my bikes when I was old enough to start buying them for myself: April O’Neil, a rubber duck-colored mountain bike I got with my first office job paycheck; Brushed Aluminum Bathsheba, a silver mountain bike I bought off a guy at my church; Sally Ride, the used road bike that carried me to every corner of my hometown of Flowery Branch, Georgia; Summitt (two <em>t’s</em> because of legendary Tennessee women’s basketball coach Pat Summitt; not one <em>t</em> like the top of a mountain); an orange hybrid that spent six majestic months zipping me around the high-altitude, oxygen-less air of Salt Lake City; Holdsclaw (like Chamique, my favorite Lady Vol), my first New York bike that was stolen 48 hours after I bought it; and Catchings (my next favorite Lady Vol), my second New York bike that never left my sight due to the previous thievery.</p>
<p>I’ve ridden bikes all over the United States, through the woods, and in the desert, over rivers, and in downtown Manhattan rush hour. I’ve ridden for fun, for transportation, for competition, for therapy, for friendship, in sun and snow and pummeling rain.</p>
<p>I’ve pedaled through Wales. I’ve glided around Amsterdam. I’ve huffed and puffed the endless ups of Switzerland. I’ve been called both a <em>wichser</em> and a <em>hurensohn </em>while trying to navigate traffic in Berlin, and a whole host of things in Paris that I didn’t really internalize because French is such a beautiful language to be cursed in. I asked about riding a bike in Venice, but everyone in Italy told me I would either fall into a canal and die or be attacked by pigeons, which is honestly like 50/50 in Venice, even if you’re not on a bike. In Belgium, I did a whole bike tour of chocolate shops. In Austria, the same, but with strudels.</p>
<p>I even worked in a bike shop for store credit, and because my best friend, the best cyclist I ever knew, the only boy I ever loved, worked every shift with me.</p>
<p>In 2019, I bought my first real pro bike, a fully carbon fiber Specialized Sirius X that I named Strawberry Shortcake Anne Lister because half her cost was covered by a bonus I got at my last job, for landing HBO as a client when they were marketing the first season of <em>Gentleman Jack; </em>plus, she kind of looked like the red Ferrari version of my original ride. We saw as much of New York together as any Central Park pigeon.</p>
<p>And then COVID-19 came, and then <a href="https://theheatherhogan.substack.com/t/long-covid">Long COVID</a>.</p>
<p>Strawberry Shortcake Anne Lister became an unmoving object perched on a stand in our kitchen, a drying rack for damp dishcloths and wet socks.</p>
<p>I’d been without my bike before.</p>
<p>I had the kind of extensive endometriosis — that’s uterine tissue growing outside the uterus, and migrating to other organs, so it’s like your bladder and intestines and stomach and pancreas and whatever else are having a period every month, too — that my gynecological surgeon told me he didn’t know how I’d even been walking around upright for the past 15 years. I have the kind of multi-level cervical stenosis — that’s when your spine starts crunching in on your spinal cord and nerve roots — that my neurosurgeon told me he didn’t even know how I was able to move any part of the upper left side of my body.</p>
<p>It made me feel so strong and permanent when doctors told me stuff like that. Like a <em>normal </em>person would fold under that kind of excruciating pain, but not me. I was a tough guy. A broken arm couldn’t keep me off my Huffy Sweet Thunder, and my whole skeleton trying to choke out my brain tubes couldn’t keep me away from Strawberry Shortcake Anne Lister.</p>
<p>Long COVID was so different. Trying to keep pushing, to power through, to ignore my body’s begging didn’t make me any better. <a href="https://longcovidjustice.org/PEM/">In fact, it made me much, much worse</a>. And so there I was, sitting at the window, coveting my neighbor’s ox for the first time in decades, watching as carefree people pedaled up and down my New York City street, all day, every day.</p>
<p>The email that flipped me over was short: “I’ve been following your writing since 2008, when I was a closeted lesbian in Alabama. You changed my life. I’m hoping to return the favor: Have you ever considered trying an e-bike?”</p>
<p>I had not considered trying an e-bike. Because they’re so expensive. Because I actually didn’t even know how e-bikes worked. Because I’ve been getting slowly, slowly better at managing my new-to-me disability, and I didn’t want to jeopardize my hard-won progress. But mostly because I didn’t want to get my hopes up, only to have them pulverized under the boot of chronic illness again. Losing my ability to ride my bike, really losing it this time, was a terrible grief. I didn’t want to do it a second time.</p>
<p>My wife is the one who got to the bottom of it when I was talking through the pros and cons of an e-bike for the thousandth time. I hadn’t mentioned the fear that quitting on Strawberry Shortcake Anne Lister was admitting something about myself that still terrified me. I hadn’t mentioned the internalized ableism. But Stacy knew.</p>
<p>“It’s not giving up,” she said, “It’s not cheating. It’s a new kind of freedom.”</p>
<p>Which, of course, is pretty much what Susan B. Anthony wrote about women on bikes 200 years ago: “Let me tell you what I think of bicycling. I think it has done more to emancipate women than anything else in the world. It gives women a feeling of freedom and self-reliance. I stand and rejoice every time I see a woman ride by on a wheel. The picture of free, untrammeled womanhood.”</p>
<p>Maybe I could be a picture of free, untrammeled womanhood, but with an electric boost to keep my body from crashing out on me. Maybe the magic of BMXmas had finally found me, like my sister said it would, at the tender age of 46. And so I said yes please, and thank you, and you have no idea what this means to me — and a few days later, an Aventon Level 2 e-bike arrived on my doorstep, in a color called <em>glacier</em>.</p>
<p>My bike shop muscle memory kicked in, and I had that thing assembled in less than an hour. I plugged in the battery to charge for 12 hours, exactly as the instructions said. And then, with a spark of hope crackling on the detritus of my heart, I laid out my bike clothes like tomorrow was the first day of school. I went to sleep. I woke up before the sun, and waited and waited and waited like Christmas morning. When it was finally light outside, I took my e-bike out for a ride.</p>
<p>There are three classes of e-bikes. I got the one that has both pedal assist and a throttle. The pedal assist is when the little motor provides power to make it easier to, well, pedal. My e-bike has five levels of pedal assist. The first one is just a little bit of support and the fifth one is like riding a hot knife through butter. When you press the throttle with your thumb, you don’t even have to pedal. The bike just zips off using all of the motor and none of your leg muscles.</p>
<p>I told Stacy I wouldn’t ride far that first day, that I just wanted to test it, but I kept texting “ten more minutes,” “ten more minutes,” “ten more minutes.”</p>
<p>When I got home, I sat on the floor, wearing my helmet, and sobbed until I was hoarse with the overwhelm of my joy. I’d just ridden a bike for an hour! A bike! For an hour! I could still feel the rhythm of pedaling in my body. I could smell the briny glimmer of the East River from when I turned onto the road by the park, for the first time in five years. The crunch of loose gravel under my tires, same as when I was six years old, same as when I first discovered the greatest feeling in the world.</p>
<p>I’ve had the e-bike for seven months now, and haven’t experienced a single negative physical effect from riding. Some days I only need pedal assist two, some days I need full pedal assist five, and I always need the throttle for the 45-degree incline that connects the bike lanes down by the water. I can’t ride every day, but I can ride a lot of days, and every time someone I know sees me out on my bike, they text to say, “I’ve never seen you smiling so big, I’ve never seen you so happy.”</p>
<p>It took me the entire summer to hit 200 miles, something I would have done in a week at the peak of my cycling life. But the more I rode — pedal assist and throttle and all — the more I realized that who I’d been didn’t matter much to me anymore. I wasn’t giving up. I wasn’t cheating. I was experiencing a whole new kind of freedom.</p>
<p>As the digital odometer clicked from 199 to 200, I felt a giddy laugh fizzing up inside of me. I threw both of my arms out to the side, the wind and sun caressing my face.</p>
<p>“Fly on, honey!” I yelled.</p>
