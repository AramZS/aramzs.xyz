<p>Mike Winkelmann, the digital artist known as Beeple, has placed himself at the center of the pack — literally — with his latest viral installation at Art Basel Miami Beach, and there’s still time to see it through Sunday.</p>
<p>His “Regular Animals” project features $100,000 robotic dogs outfitted with hyper-realistic heads resembling Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, and Jeff Bezos, alongside art legends Pablo Picasso and Andy Warhol. The robot dogs roam a plexiglass pen, capturing images through chest-mounted cameras that are processed by AI and printed from their hindquarters, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/arts-culture/fine-art/beeple-robot-dogs-regular-animals-art-basel-nft-84043fb9">according to the WSJ</a>. Of the prints produced, 256 include QR codes that offer collectors a free NFT, distributed in bags labeled “Excrement Sample.”</p>
<p>Beeple also included himself in this exclusive group, a move the Charleston-based artist himself called “ballsy.” His self-portrait dog sold first, surprising even Beeple, he told the Journal.</p>
<p>The project marks at least the second time Winkelmann has become the art world’s main character. Four years ago, his digital collage sold at Christie’s for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/beeples-69-million-nft-sale-marks-a-potentially-transformative-moment-for-the-art-world/">$69 million</a>, helping to fuel an NFT boom that would peak a year later before largely imploding.</p>
