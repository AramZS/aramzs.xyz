<p>Traveling without <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/09/travel/real-id-deadline-what-to-know.html">a Real ID</a> is now going to cost travelers.</p>
<p>As of Feb. 1, 2026, passengers without one will be required to pay a $45 fee in order to fly from U.S. airports, the <a href="https://www.tsa.gov/news/press/releases/2025/12/01/tsa-introduces-new-45-fee-option-for-travelers-without-real-id">Transportation Security Administration announced</a> on Monday.</p>
<p>Travelers will be able to pay the fee, valid for a 10-day period, before they arrive at the airport. Details about online payment or what screening is entailed in this alternative identity verification process, called <a href="https://www.tsa.gov/tsaconfirm-id">T.S.A. Confirm.ID</a>, were not yet available.</p>
<p>In May, after years of delay, the government <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/07/travel/real-id-requirement-tsa-airports.html">began requiring Real IDs</a>, which are federally compliant state-issued driver’s licenses, learner’s permits or nondriver IDs, at airports. Government officials said that the change was meant to enhance security and create a consistent standard for state-issued documentation.</p>
<p>But the authorities did not impose any penalties for not having a Real ID, and people flying without Real ID-compliant documents were allowed to travel with additional screening, which, <a href="https://www.tsa.gov/travel/security-screening/identification">according to the T.S.A. website</a>, included collecting current addresses.</p>
<p>“The current alternative identity verification process is time and resource intensive, limiting the number of individuals for whom T.S.A. can provide the service,” the agency said in a notice filed in the Federal Register last month. “Requiring a fee for the modernized alternative identity verification program will ensure that the cost to administer this program is recovered from the users who benefit from it.”</p>

<p>The verification process for non-Real IDs will differ airport to airport, the T.S.A. said.</p>
<p>More than 94 percent of passengers are already using a Real ID or another acceptable form of identification like a passport, the T.S.A. said.</p>
<p>The fee is a notable increase from the $18 payment the T.S.A. was recently considering. In the <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/11/20/2025-20474/tsa-modernized-alternative-identity-verification-user-fee#dates">document filed in the Federal Register</a>, the agency said the new fee system would “address government-incurred costs” and that it expected some travelers to pay the fee more than once.</p>
<p>Bill McGee, a senior fellow for aviation at the <a href="https://www.economicliberties.us/">American Economic Liberties Project</a>, a progressive-leaning nonprofit, emphasized that the new fee could especially penalize families who don’t travel frequently.</p>
