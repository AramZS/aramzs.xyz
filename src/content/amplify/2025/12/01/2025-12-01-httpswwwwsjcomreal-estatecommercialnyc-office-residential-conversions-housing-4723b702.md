<h2 data-testid="dek-block">A tour of Manhattan buildings you can now call home, and a peek inside the architectural hacks that make transformations possible</h2>
<p>By <a data-testid="author-link" href="https://www.wsj.com/news/author/brian-mcgill">Brian McGill</a> , <a data-testid="author-link" href="https://www.wsj.com/news/author/max-rust">Max Rust</a> and <a data-testid="author-link" href="https://www.wsj.com/news/author/peter-grant">Peter Grant</a> Dec. 1, 2025 5:30 am ET</p>
<p>Over the past two decades, developers in New York have converted nearly 30 million square feet of office space into residential living, with the pace of transformation picking up in recent years.</p>
<p>Most office buildings were considered too wide and mechanically complex to repurpose into apartments with kitchens, bathrooms and bedrooms. But New York developers are solving those problems with new architectural hacks—cut-through notches, carved light wells, and strategic wall-offs of interior cores that create space for new residential floors.</p>

<p>Even the pickup in conversion will make only a small dent in New York’s more than 75 million square feet of surplus office space. But Manhattan has one advantage other cities can’t match: a rental market with median $4,500 monthly rents for a one-bedroom.</p>
<p>Design breakthroughs pioneered in Manhattan will likely accelerate the pace of conversion in New York as well as the rest of the country. The national pipeline currently includes 78,500 units, up from 23,000 in 2022, according to RentCafe.com. And as these projects multiply, the playbook keeps expanding.</p>
<p>“There are more case studies that prove the naysayers wrong,” said Robert Fuller, principal of Gensler.</p>
