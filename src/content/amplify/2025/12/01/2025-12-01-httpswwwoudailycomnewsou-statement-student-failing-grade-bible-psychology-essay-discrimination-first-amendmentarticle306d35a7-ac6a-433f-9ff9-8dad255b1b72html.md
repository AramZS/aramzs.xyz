<p>“The University of Oklahoma takes seriously concerns involving First Amendment rights, certainly including religious freedoms. Upon receiving notice from the student on the grading of an assignment, the University immediately began a full review of the situation and has acted swiftly to address the matter,” the statement read.</p>

<p>According to the statement, university leaders contacted Samantha Fulnecky, a psychology junior, the day she submitted her complaint and a formal grade appeals process was conducted. Steps were taken to ensure there was no academic harm to the student, the statement reads.</p>
<p>OU also placed a graduate student instructor on administrative leave and placed a different full-time professor to teach the class for the remainder of the semester after the student reported filing a claim of illegal discrimination based on religious beliefs.</p>
<p>“OU has a clear process for reviewing such claims and it has been activated, …” the statement reads. “OU remains firmly committed to fairness, respect and protecting every student’s right to express sincerely held religious beliefs.”</p>
<p>Gov. Kevin Stitt <a href="https://x.com/GovStitt/status/1995209374193852595?s=20">wrote in a post</a> on social platform X Sunday that the situation was “deeply concerning” and called on the OU Board of Regents to review the results of the investigation.</p>
<p>“The 1st Amendment is foundational to our freedom &amp; inseparable from a well rounded education. The situation at OU is deeply concerning,” Stitt wrote. “I’m calling on the OU regents to review the results of the investigation &amp; ensure other students aren’t unfairly penalized for their beliefs.”</p>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Fulnecky contested a grade on an essay assignment in an OU psychology course, stating she believed she received the grade because of her religious beliefs. Fulnecky reportedly received zero points out of 25 for her assignment. Fulnecky also filed a formal claim of illegal discrimination based on religious beliefs.</p>
<p>In the essay, <a href="https://www.oklahoman.com/story/news/education/2025/11/25/ou-oklahoma-samantha-fulnecky-read-essay-gender-bible/87463858007/">published by The Oklahoman</a>, Fulnecky cites the Bible to argue that traditional gender roles should not be considered stereotypes. She wrote eliminating gender would put people “farther from God’s original plan for humans.”</p>
<p>The instructor stated the grade was based on the essay’s lack of empirical evidence and said parts of the essay were offensive, according to reporting by The Oklahoman.</p>
<p>Fulnecky reportedly asked her instructor to reconsider the grade, stating she met the requirements of the essay, but the instructor denied the request.</p>
