  Flock accidentally exposed training materials and a panel which tracked what
  its AI annotators were working on. It showed that Flock, which has cameras in
  thousands of U.S. communities, is using workers in the Philippines to review
  and classify footage.

<p>Flock, the automatic license plate reader (ALPR) and AI-powered camera company, uses overseas workers from Upwork to train its machine learning algorithms, with training material telling workers how to review and categorize footage including images people and vehicles in the U.S., according to material reviewed by 404 Media that was accidentally exposed by the company.</p>
<p>The findings bring up questions about who exactly has access to footage collected by Flock surveillance cameras and where people reviewing the footage may be based. Flock has become a pervasive technology in the U.S., with its cameras present in thousands of communities that cops use everyday to investigate things like car jackings. Local police have also <a href="https://www.404media.co/ice-taps-into-nationwide-ai-enabled-camera-network-data-shows/"><u>performed numerous lookups</u></a> for ICE in the system.</p>
<p>Companies that use AI or machine learning regularly turn to overseas workers to train their algorithms, often because the labor is cheaper than hiring domestically. But the nature of Flock’s business—creating a surveillance system that constantly monitors U.S. residents’ movements—means that footage might be more sensitive than other AI training jobs.</p>
<p><b><strong>Do you work at Flock or know more about the company? I would love to hear from you. Using a non-work device, you can message me securely on Signal at joseph.404 or send me an email at joseph@404media.co.</strong></b></p>
<p>Flock’s cameras continuously scan the license plate, color, brand, and model of all vehicles that drive by. Law enforcement are then able to search cameras nationwide to see where else a vehicle has driven. Authorities typically dig through this data without a warrant, leading the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) to <a href="https://www.404media.co/aclu-and-eff-sue-a-city-blanketed-with-flock-surveillance-cameras/"><u>recently sue a city</u></a> blanketed in nearly 500 Flock cameras.</p>
<p>Broadly, Flock uses AI or machine learning to automatically detect license plates, vehicles, <a href="https://www.flocksafety.com/blog/flock-safetys-q2-2025-law-enforcement-product-launch-summary-increasing-speed-for-law-enforcement?ref=404media.co"><u>and people</u></a>, including what clothes they are wearing, from camera footage. <a href="https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/77/9a/03/7b3b26499077d4/US11416545.pdf?ref=404media.co"><u>A Flock patent</u></a> also mentions cameras detecting “race.”</p>

<p>Multiple tipsters pointed 404 Media to an exposed online panel which showed various metrics associated with Flock’s AI training.</p>
<p>It included figures on “annotations completed” and “annotator tasks remaining in queue,” with annotations being the notes workers add to reviewed footage to help train AI algorithms. Tasks include categorizing vehicle makes, colors, and types, transcribing license plates, and “audio tasks.” Flock recently started advertising a feature <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/10/flocks-gunshot-detection-microphones-will-start-listening-human-voices?ref=404media.co"><u>that will detect “screaming.”</u></a> The panel showed workers sometimes completed thousands upon thousands of annotations over two day periods.</p>
<p>The exposed panel included a list of people tasked with annotating Flock’s footage. Taking those names, 404 Media found some were located in the Philippines, according to their LinkedIn and other online profiles.</p>
<p>Many of these people were employed through Upwork, according to the exposed material. Upwork is a gig and freelance work platform where companies can hire designers, writers, or pay for “AI services,” according to Upwork’s website.</p>

<p>The tipsters also pointed to several publicly available Flock presentations which explained in more detail how workers were to categorize the footage. It is not clear what specific camera footage Flock’s AI workers are reviewing. But screenshots included in the worker guides show numerous images from vehicles with U.S. plates, including in New York, Michigan, Florida, New Jersey, and California. Other images include road signs clearly showing the footage is taken from inside the U.S., and one image contains an advertisement for a specific law firm in Atlanta.</p>
<p>One slide about audio told workers to “listen to the audio all the way through,” then select from a dropdown menu including “car wreck,” “gunshot," and “reckless driving.” Another slide says tire screeching might be associated with someone “doing donuts,” and another says that because it can be hard to distinguish between an adult and a child screaming, workers should use a second dropdown menu explaining their confidence in what they heard, with options like “certain” and “uncertain.”</p>
<p>Another slide deck explains that workers should not label people inside cars, but should label those riding motorcycles or walking.</p>
<p>After 404 Media contacted Flock for comment, the exposed panel became no longer available. Flock then declined to comment.</p>
