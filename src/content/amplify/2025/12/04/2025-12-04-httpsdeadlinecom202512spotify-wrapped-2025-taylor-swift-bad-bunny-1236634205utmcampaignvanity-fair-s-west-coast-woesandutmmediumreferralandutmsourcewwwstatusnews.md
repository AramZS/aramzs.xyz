<p>Spotify has dropped its 11<sup>th</sup> annual Wrapped, the personalized year-end listening summaries for users. <a data-tag="bad-bunny" href="https://deadline.com/tag/bad-bunny/">Bad Bunny</a> is the giant streamer’s global top artist for the year (with more than 19.8 billion streams) and his DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS is the top album. Die With A Smile by Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars is the no. 1 global song. Movie soundtracks got a boost with KPop Demon Hunters the no. 2 global album.</p>
<p>Stateside, <a data-tag="taylor-swift" href="https://deadline.com/tag/taylor-swift/">Taylor Swift</a> is the top artist. <em>I’m The Problem</em> by Morgan Wallen, and luther (with sza) by Kendrick Lamar &amp; SZA, hit, respectively, as top album and top song.</p>

<p><em>The Joe Rogan Experience</em> is Spotify’s no. 1 global and U.S. podcast. Fourth Wing by Rebecca Yarros leads all audiobook, a newly added category.</p>
<p>Wrapped recaps users’ top genres, artists and songs for the year, calculates how many times a user streamed each of their top 100 tracks, and how their top five artists shifted month by month. The campaign is a fan favorite and an increasingly key marketing tool although it saw some blowback from last year’s edition — “reminding us just how much this experience means to our users. It reinforces for us that we need to surpass expectations, and we know expectations are big,” said Dustee Jenkins, chief public affairs officer, kicking off an event in New York with an early peek at Wrapped 2025.</p>
<p>Wrapped Party is one of a dozen new features this year. It turns listening data into a live experience a user can host inviting up to nine friends to compare listening stats — a first step in Wrapped becoming more interactive. “This isn’t just rehashing the data you’ve already got, these are all new data stories including things like the most obsessed fan; who has the most discoveries; the most and least compatible people in the party,” said Payman Kassaie, Director, Brand + Creative.</p>
<p>A new Listening Age feature compares users’ musical tastes to others in the same age group. Fan Leaderboards show users where they rank globally in streaming certain artists based on total minutes listened. Wrapped will also sort users into six new Clubs based on their streaming habits.</p>
<p>The campaign will spill outside the app with some 50 real world fan experiences in major cities globally and a short film featuring Sap Concho, the endangered Puerto Rican crested toad that’s a mascot in Bad Bunny’s album DeBí TiRAR MáS FOToS. It will play on social media, out-of-home activations and select theaters in the U.S. and Canada.</p>
<p>Creators and advertisers on Spotify also receive their own personalized Wrapped data trove.</p>
