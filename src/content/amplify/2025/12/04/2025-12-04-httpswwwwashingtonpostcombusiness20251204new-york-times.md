<p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s new requirement that journalists pledge not to solicit any unauthorized information violates the First and Fifth amendments, the newspaper alleges, calling it “an attempt to exert control over reporting the government dislikes.”</p>
<p>The New York Times sued the Defense Department over its press policy prohibiting journalists from soliciting any information not explicitly authorized for release by the government. In a complaint filed Thursday morning in federal district court in Washington, the Times alleged that the press rules violated the First Amendment’s guarantee of a free press and the newspaper’s due process rights under the Fifth Amendment.</p>
