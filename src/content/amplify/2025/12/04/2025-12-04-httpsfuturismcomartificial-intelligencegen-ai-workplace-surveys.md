<p>After three years of unprecedented tech spending and nonstop hype, the demand for AI in the workplace seems to be drying up fast.</p>
<p>Referencing data from a recent US Census Bureau survey, <a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2025/11/26/investors-expect-ai-use-to-soar-thats-not-happening"><em>The </em><em>Economist</em> estimated</a> that the percentage of Americans using AI to “produce goods and services” at large companies rang in at a modest 11 percent in October, the latest available <a href="https://www.census.gov/hfp/btos/data_downloads">survey date</a>. It’s not just that the figure is a bit soggy for the supposedly world-changing technology, but that it’s suddenly moving in the wrong direction: the financial publication notes that the percentage is actually <em>down</em> from 12 percent in the prior survey, conducted two weeks previously.</p>
<p>Looking at the big picture doesn’t make it any prettier. Back in March, the number of businesses with 100-249 employees that reported <em>not </em>using AI within the last two weeks stood at 74.1 percent. The survey results show a steady uptick in “no” results over the past few months, culminating in a dreadful 81.4 percent as of the latest poll.</p>
<p>For big corporations with over 250 employees, meanwhile, the “no” reports have crept up to 68.6 percent, up from the year’s low of 62.4 percent recorded in February.</p>
<p>The data is nothing if not a major red flag for an industry which is <a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/jpmorgan-global-data-center-and-ai-infra-spend-to-hit-5-trillion-demand-for-compute-remains-astronomical/">expected to spend $5 trillion</a> on AI infrastructure between now and 2030. To do so will require a massive increase in revenue from both business and personal AI use — the <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Business/ai-make-big-profits-experts-weigh-bubble-fears/story?id=127858140">latter of which</a> has been lagging.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for the tech industry, enterprise AI customers aren’t picking up the slack. Though various non-government surveys cited by <em>The Economist</em> varied wildly in their numbers, they all seemed to spell out the same results: AI remains more of an experimental plaything in the workplace than a serious driver of productivity.</p>
<p>One economist at Stanford who tracks the use of generative AI at work found a <a href="https://x.com/Jon_Hartley_/status/1980742482200822147?s=20">major drop</a> in usage month to month: though 46 percent of respondents reported using the tech in June, that number had fallen to 37 percent by September. Another estimate, by <a href="https://ramp.com/data/ai-index">Fintech firm Ramp</a>, found that AI use at American corporations went through the roof earlier in 2025 to around 40 percent, but has since plateaued.</p>
<p>The results follow a disappointing summer for AI advancements, with models like <a href="https://mashable.com/article/gpt5-coming">OpenAI’s GPT-5</a> falling short of expected performance gains. Still, the cracks in enterprise AI adoption had begun to show as early as December of 2024, when an <a href="https://mashable.com/article/gpt5-coming">EY pulse survey</a> of 500 senior executives found over half felt they were “failing in their role” of supporting AI in their companies.</p>
<p>Instead, executives pointed to a creep of “AI fatigue” among the rank and file — which a year of <a href="https://futurism.com/ceo-ai-scare-labor">AI horrors</a> probably hasn’t helped.</p>
<p>With a $600 billion gulf between AI revenue and AI spending, an immense amount is riding on whether the tech can start bringing home the bacon.</p>
