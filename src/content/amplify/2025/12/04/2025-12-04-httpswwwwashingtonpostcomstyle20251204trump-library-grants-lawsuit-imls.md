Public Library. The DCPL has received funding from the Institute of Museum and Library Services. (Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post)</figcaption></figure><p>The federal agency responsible for supporting the nation’s libraries and museums has reinstated all grants terminated by President Donald Trump, complying with a federal court ruling that found the executive order mandating the cuts to have been unlawful.</p><p>The Institute of Museum and Library Services is<b> </b>the only federal agency responsible for funding libraries.<b> </b>This year, the White House ordered it to scale down to a “minimum presence,” forcing it to slash its spending by millions.</p><p>But <a href="https://washingtonpost.com/documents/c2f61b56-b9c0-4b53-848e-d548ccf73bf7.pdf" target="_blank">in a November ruling</a>, the U.S. District Court for Rhode Island found that the Trump administration’s effort to dismantle the IMLS was unlawful.</p><p>In a brief statement <a href="https://www.imls.gov/news/statement-agencys-reinstatement-terminated-imls-grants" target="_blank">posted online</a> Wednesday, the IMLS said that “upon further review” it had reinstated all federal grants. “This action supersedes any prior notices which may have been received related to grant termination,” it added. The statement did not directly reference the court ruling.</p><p>The Trump administration had <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/03/15/trump-voa-environment-executive-orders/" target="_blank">gutted</a> the IMLS in March, ordering the agency to dismantle as much of itself as possible. In response, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/04/01/doge-imls-library-museum-leave/" target="_blank">staff at the agency were placed</a> on administrative leave.</p><p class="rw-outer-content"><span>Some content could not be imported from the original document.</span> <a href="https://washingtonpost.com/style/2025/12/04/trump-library-grants-lawsuit-imls/">View content ↗ </a></p><p>According to federal spending data, the agency’s planned spending for the fiscal year ending in September was $215 million, down from more than $300 million the previous two fiscal years.</p><p>In April, the attorneys general of 21 states filed a <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.rid.59257/gov.uscourts.rid.59257.1.0_2.pdf" target="_blank">lawsuit</a> challenging the legality of Trump’s executive order dismantling the agency, along with several others. In his ruling last month, U.S. District Judge John J. McConnell Jr. found that the administration’s efforts to diminish the agencies had been “arbitrary and capricious” and that the president did not have the unilateral authority to refuse to spend congressionally appropriated funds.</p><p>“The question presented in this case is a familiar one: may the Executive Branch undertake such actions in circumvention of the will of the Legislative Branch? In recent months, this Court — along with other courts across the country — has concluded that it may not. That answer remains the same here,” McConnell wrote.</p><p>The total value of the IMLS grants reinstated as a result of the order was not immediately clear. Last year, the agency gave libraries and museums <a href="https://www.imls.gov/find-funding/funding-opportunities/grant-programs" target="_blank">$266.7 million</a> in grants and funding for policymaking and research.</p><p><a href="https://www.ala.org/news/2025/12/ala-welcomes-reinstatement-all-federal-imls-grants-libraries" target="_blank">In a statement</a> welcoming Wednesday’s reinstatement, American Library Association President Sam Helmick said: “This means that libraries across the country will be able to resume vital services for learning, imagination, and economic opportunity. … Every public, school and academic library and their patrons benefit from the research findings and program outcomes from individual library and organization grantees.”</p><p>The bulk of IMLS’s grants are distributed through its Grants to States program, which <a href="https://www.imls.gov/find-funding/funding-opportunities/grants-to-states-overview" target="_blank">annually distributes $160 million to library agencies</a> in every state and the District of Columbia using a population-based formula. <a href="https://ilovelibraries.org/article/all-federal-library-grants-previously-canceled-by-federal-agency-restored/" target="_blank">According to ALA</a>, the nation’s oldest library group, library administrators use the money to fund initiatives such as summer reading programs for children and early-years literacy programs.</p><p>IMLS was created by an act of Congress in 1996, providing the primary source of federal finding to the nation’s 124,000 libraries. In June, a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/06/16/trump-impoundment-act-gao/" target="_blank">federal watchdog said the Trump administration</a> had violated the Impoundment Act by withholding congressionally appropriated funds to the IMLO. Public libraries receive the majority of their regular funding from local, city and state governments, with only a fraction coming directly from federal sources.</p></body></html>
