<p>Did CBS News and “60 Minutes” edit an interview with President Donald Trump to keep Trump from looking bad? Is Trump throwing his weight around when it comes to CBS News?</p>
<p>A leading Democrat wants answers.</p>
<p>Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Maryland, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, has <a href="https://democrats-judiciary.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/democrats-judiciary.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/2025-12-03.raskin-to-weinstein-cbs-re-editorial-decisions.pdf">filed a complaint</a> with CBS News’ new ombudsman over the way that “60 Minutes” edited a recent interview with Trump.</p>
<p>In addition, Raskin questioned if Trump has exerted power over the network following the administration’s approval of the merger between Skydance and Paramount, CBS’s parent company.</p>
<p>Raskin wrote to CBS News ombudsman Kenneth Weinstein, “President Trump increasingly appears to be exercising direct control over CBS’s editorial decisions, destroying CBS’s ‘journalistic integrity’ while violating its right to be free from governmental coercion and manipulation.”</p>
<p>CBS News’ Norah O’Donnell interviewed Trump for a “60 Minutes” episode that aired on Nov. 2. About 28 minutes of O’Donnell’s interview aired on “60 Minutes.” A longer, 73-minute version of the interview, as well as a transcript, was posted online.</p>
<p>Raskin wrote in his letter, “Most egregiously, CBS removed substantive questions about corruption after President Trump objected. When interviewer Norah O’Donnell asked about the appearance of corruption behind President Trump’s pardon of Binance founder Changpeng Zhao — who had pleaded guilty to money laundering and whose company struck a $2 billion deal with the Trump family’s cryptocurrency venture — President Trump got defensive: ‘I can’t say, because — I can’t say — I’m not concerned. I don’t — I’d rather not have you ask the question. But I let you ask it,’ he said. CBS omitted that entire exchange about potential conflicts of interest from both video versions, depriving the public of critical information about President Trump’s obvious pay-to-play pardon scheme and his obvious discomfort.”</p>
<p>Raskin also accused CBS News of omitting a part of the interview where Trump bragged about CBS settling a lawsuit with him over another “60 Minutes” interview — the one with then-Vice President and Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris before the 2024 election. Trump sued Paramount and CBS, claiming Harris’ interview was edited in such a way to help her win the election. Despite legal experts believing Trump had no chance to prevail in court, Paramount ultimately settled by agreeing to pay Trump $16 million.</p>
<p>In the interview transcript, Trump said, “Actually ‘60 Minutes’ paid me a lotta money. And you don’t have to put this on, because I don’t wanna embarrass you … ‘60 Minutes’ was forced to pay me — a lot of money because they took (Vice President Harris’) answer out that was so bad, it was election-changing … You can’t have fake news. You’ve gotta have legit news.”</p>
<p>Raskin wrote in his letter, “CBS again complied with President Trump’s request, omitting that entire exchange from both the television broadcast and the extended online version.”</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, after Skydance and CEO David Ellison acquired Paramount and took over CBS News in late summer, the network put an ombudsman in place.</p>
<p>Raskin went on to write, “Mr. Weinstein: news ombudsmen serve as independent advocates for the public, investigating complaints and publicly critiquing their organizations when those organizations fall short. You have a duty to defend CBS’s editorial independence, rather than ratify President Trump’s influence over the organization’s coverage. The facts here are clear. President Trump directed CBS to edit his own interview after suing the network for editing his opponent’s interview, and CBS complied with his requests and omitted its anchor’s questions about President Trump’s pardons. It is one thing for CBS to make independent editorial decisions protected by the First Amendment. It is quite another to make edits at the President’s demand out of fear of retribution.”</p>
<p>Just one more thought on this. Media observers and viewers are keeping a close eye on CBS News, especially since it named Bari Weiss editor-in-chief. (Many consider Weiss, based on her work, to be conservative, although she has described herself in the past as a “radical centrist.”) But, thus far, it would appear that CBS News continues to vigorously cover Trump and his administration, including critical stories of the president on “60 Minutes.”</p>
