<p>A forthcoming report from the Defense Department’s watchdog dismantles the excuses that Pete Hegseth’s former Fox News colleagues offered in March after The Atlantic <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/03/trump-administration-accidentally-texted-me-its-war-plans/682151/">reported</a> that the secretary of defense had <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/03/signal-group-chat-attack-plans-hegseth-goldberg/682176/">shared plans</a> for an imminent U.S. strike against Houthi targets in Yemen on a Signal chain with other top Trump administration officials — and, inadvertently, Atlantic Editor-in-Chief Jeffrey Goldberg.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/national-security/2025/12/hegseth-signalgate-trump-defense-pentagon/684997/">The Atlantic</a> and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/03/politics/watchdog-report-hegseth-signal">CNN</a> reported Wednesday that the DOD inspector general concluded after a monthslong probe into Hegseth’s conduct that the information Hegseth shared had been classified at the time he received it, and that sending the attack plans through unsecured networks had endangered U.S. national security and the lives of the military service members tasked to the mission. An unclassified version of the report is scheduled for release Thursday.</p>
<p>Fox’s right-wing stars scrambled to downplay Hegseth’s actions in the days after The Atlantic first reported on his text messages, denying that the information had been classified or that its transmission through unsecured channels carried risks and generally mocking the notion that anything untoward had occurred beyond Goldberg’s addition to the chain.</p>
<p>“It's abundantly clear that none of this put national security at risk,” Fox host Laura Ingraham <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/fox-news/laura-ingraham-group-chat-scandal-its-abundantly-clear-none-put-national-security-risk">claimed</a> of the texts. “And there was no risk to our troops, and the entire world is safer because of the actions that our troops took. Now, some of us are actually happier about that, others are rooting for the United States to fail.”</p>
<p>Sean Hannity <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/fox-news/foxs-newest-defense-signal-mess-detailed-information-about-imminent-military-strikes-no">insisted to his</a> prime-time viewers that “there was no classified material revealed in those texts,” later adding, “I would spend more time on this Signal issue, but it's such a nonissue, I don't even think it's worth talking about at this point.” On his radio show, Hannity <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/sean-hannity/sean-hannity-there-difference-between-sensitive-information-versus-classified">expanded</a> on his argument: “The distinction between sensitive and top secret classification information is very critical because we're dealing with sensitive information. The administration has reiterated no classified material was discussed, and, more importantly, the mission was operationally a complete success.”</p>
<p>Jesse Watters initially <a href="https://www.mediaite.com/tv/jesse-watters-brushes-off-mike-waltzs-wee-group-chat-security-breach-to-attack-hillary-clinton/">treated the story</a> as a joke, asking his viewers: “Did you ever try to start a group text? You’re adding people and you accidentally add the wrong person? All of a sudden your Aunt Mary knows all your raunchy plans for the bachelor party? Well, that kind of happened today with the Trump administration.” After Goldberg released the texts, Watters <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/media/4028707">declared</a> the scandal “dead in 48 hours,” saying that all they showed was that officials “accidentally leaked to a reporter. It was a mistake. Hopefully it doesn’t happen again.”</p>
<p>Will Cain, Hegseth’s former co-host on <em>Fox &amp; Friends</em>’ weekend edition, <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/fox-news/fox-host-says-leaked-yemen-strike-plans-being-discussed-signal-transparent-insight">claimed</a> on his eponymous show that while “it is incredibly concerning that sensitive information would be sent with a journalist included in the thread.” With that out of the way, he explained why this was actually good: “But the bigger takeaway from me is it is an insight, a transparent insight, into the thought process and dialog of our national leaders.”</p>
<p>And for Greg Gutfeld, texting battle plans over unsecured channels is <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/fox-news/greg-gutfeld-excuses-yemen-strikes-leak-thats-how-winners-live-their-lives">simply</a> “how winners live their lives.”</p>
<p>While Hegseth’s old buddies at Fox News were bloviating on his behalf, legal and military experts were explaining to journalists — including Fox’s own <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/pete-hegseth/fox-news-reports-current-and-former-defense-officials-say-sharing-operational-details">Jennifer Griffin</a> — the grave risks of Hegseth’s actions. As more evidence arose of Hegseth’s malfeasance, including reports that Hegseth’s messages were <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/fox-news/fox-news-gave-new-classified-email-revelation-hegseth-signal-scandal-just-40-seconds">derived</a> from a classified email labeled “SECRET/NOFORN” and that he had also <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/pete-hegseth/fox-stars-pass-defending-hegseth-amid-pentagon-chaos">shared attack plans</a> in a second text chain that included members of his family, they went quiet rather than either admit fault or double down on their support for the defense secretary’s actions.</p>
<p>The IG report’s release comes as Hegseth faces <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/pete-hegseth/flashback-when-pete-hegseth-endorsed-soldiers-executing-captured-alleged-combatants">media and congressional scrutiny</a> for reportedly ordering extrajudicial killings in the Caribbean that legal experts argue would constitute “at best, a war crime under federal law.”</p>
<p>It turns out <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/pete-hegseth/pete-hegseth-debacle-was-inevitable">there are downsides</a> to promoting a second-tier Fox pundit best known for his defenses of alleged war criminals to lead the most powerful military in the history of the world and a sprawling bureaucracy with millions of employees.</p>
