<p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/PSKY/">Paramount Skydance</a> is launching a hostile bid to buy <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/WBD/">Warner Bros. Discovery</a> after it lost out to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NFLX/">Netflix</a> in a months-long bidding war for the legacy assets, the company said Monday.</p>
<p>Paramount will go straight to WBD shareholders with an all-cash, $30-per-share offer. That's the same bid WBD rejected last week, according to people familiar with the bid who asked not to be named because the details were private. The offer is backstopped with equity financing from the Ellison family and the private-equity firm RedBird Capital and $54 billion of debt commitments from Bank of America, Citi and Apollo Global Management.</p>
<p>On Friday, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/05/neflix-warner-bros-discovery-deal.html">Netflix announced a deal</a> to acquire WBD's studio and streaming assets for $72 billion. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/05/paramount-david-ellison-wbd-bidding-war-hostile-bid.html">David Ellison-run Paramount had been bidding for the entirety</a> of Warner Bros. Discovery, including those assets and the company's TV networks like CNN and TNT Sports.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/CMCSA/">Comcast</a> also bid for the streaming and studio businesses, CNBC previously reported.</p>
<p>Paramount has <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/05/warner-bros-discovery-wbd-sale-split-plans-deadline.html">repeatedly argued to the WBD board of directors</a> that keeping Warner Bros. Discovery whole was in the best interest of its shareholders.</p>
<p>Paramount executives also plan to argue their deal will have a much shorter regulatory approval process given the company's smaller size and friendly relationship with the Trump administration, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>Netflix's proposed acquisition has already <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/05/netflix-warner-bros-deal-regulatory-questions.html">raised antitrust questions,</a> in particular for combining two of the most dominant streaming platforms. CNBC reported Friday that the Trump administration was <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/05/trump-netflix-wbd-deal.html">viewing the deal with "heavy skepticism,"</a> and President Donald Trump said Sunday the market share considerations could pose a "problem."</p>
