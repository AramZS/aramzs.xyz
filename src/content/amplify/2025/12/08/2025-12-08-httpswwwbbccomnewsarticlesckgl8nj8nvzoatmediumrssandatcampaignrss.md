<p>Gen Z are going retro. People in their teens and early 20s are increasingly turning to old school tech in a bid to unplug from the online world.</p>
<p>Amazon UK told BBC Scotland News that retro-themed products surged in popularity during its Black Friday event, with portable vinyl turntables, Tamagotchis and disposable cameras among their best sellers.</p>
<p>Retailers Currys and John Lewis also said they had seen retro gadgets making a comeback with sales of radios, instant cameras and alarm clocks showing big jumps.</p>

<p>While some people scroll endlessly through Netflix in search of their next watch, 17-year-old Declan prefers the more traditional approach of having a DVD in his hands.</p>
<p>He grew up surrounded by his gran's collection and later bought his own after visiting a shop with a friend.</p>
<p>"The main selling point for me is the cases," he says.</p>
<p>"There's something about really clean cases that I love."</p>
<p>Streaming services like Netflix and Disney+ dominate the market but Declan says he values ownership.</p>
<p>"It's nice to have something you own instead of paying for subscriptions all the time," he says.</p>
<p>"If I lost access to streaming tomorrow, I'd still have my favourite movies ready to watch."</p>
<p>He admits DVDs are a "dying way of watching movies" but that makes them cheaper.</p>
<p>"I think they're just cool, there's something authentic about having DVDs," he says.</p>
<p>"These things are generations old, it's nice to have them available."</p>

<p>Saul, 20, has been collecting vinyl records since 2016.</p>
<p>With new vinyl albums costing about £35 on average, it might seem expensive compared to streaming but Saul feels it's worth it.</p>
<p>"It's a more authentic sound," he says.</p>
<p>"The grooves on the record make it feel real, you can hear the difference.</p>
<p>"It's about having something physical you can look at instead of just scrolling through your phone mindlessly."</p>
<p>For Saul, the appeal goes beyond sound quality.</p>
<p>"You've got the actual cover art, and you put the disc down yourself, it's a hands-on experience." he says.</p>
<p>Saul admits that vinyl's popularity might not last forever.</p>
<p>"For a lot of people, I think vinyl is just a trend," he says.</p>
<p>"It's the same way things come and go, like different trends on social media.</p>
<p>"Once it becomes too expensive, people will click off it," he says.</p>
<p>"I'll still collect because I like to have them. I like having that option to listen."</p>
<h2>'Physical cameras are timeless'</h2>

<p>While most people instinctively reach for their phones to take photos, 21-year-old Aoibheann prefers the deliberate artistry of traditional cameras.</p>
<p>"There's something about the quality of them and the style of photo you get, it's unmatched compared to your phone." she says.</p>
<p>"There's more pressure with film because you're not going to see the photo straight away, you have to wait. But that's the novelty of it," she explains.</p>
<p>"I'll take my camera to birthdays, holidays, even walks," she says.</p>
<p>Aoibheann believes the appeal of traditional cameras runs deeper than aesthetics.</p>
<p>It is rooted in nostalgia, she says.</p>
<p>"Many people are curious about the experience of using physical cameras because they grew up seeing their parents use them," she says.</p>
<p>"Gen Z enjoys the novelty of something we don't usually have. It's a break from phones and instant gratification.</p>
<p>"Physical cameras are timeless. They'll never go out of fashion because past generations relied on them."</p>

<p>Kyle, 21 got a PSP to relive his childhood and enjoy the nostalgic simplicity of gaming without modern hassles like updates or downloads.</p>
<p>The PSP (PlayStation Portable) is a handheld gaming console made by Sony that became an instant hit in the UK when it was introduced in 2005 but was discontinued a decade later as technology moved on.</p>
<p>"It was the first game console that I grew up with, it's a weird feeling, it's like a home comfort, you know? It feels retro," he says.</p>
<p>"Obviously the screen isn't as good, the buttons aren't as good, it's a lot more unreliable, but that's not the point.</p>
<p>"When you play a modern PlayStation or Xbox, you can't just play, you need to download updates. With a PSP, you put a game in and play".</p>
<p>Kyle says: "Since I got it, I've used it almost every day. I've been playing Need for Speed on my PSP, it's more addictive than any game I've got on my PS5."</p>
<p>Embodying the streamlined look of early-2000s technology, the PSP resurgence could be seen as just another passing trend.</p>
<p>"I feel like there's definitely a performative aspect to it, almost like an accessory for some people." he says.</p>
<p>"For the majority, it's just a fad, a trend. But for people like me, I'll be playing this until it breaks."</p>
