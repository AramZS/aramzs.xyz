<p>Google quietly updated its <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/16297775#:~:text=Ads%20in%20AI%20Overviews%20are%20currently%20available%20in%20English%20on%20mobile%20and%20desktop%20devices%20in%20the%20following%20countries%3A%20Australia%2C%20Canada%2C%20India%2C%20Indonesia%2C%20Kenya%2C%20Malaysia%2C%20New%20Zealand%2C%20Nigeria%2C%20Pakistan%2C%20Philippines%2C%20Singapore%2C%20and%20US.">AI Overviews ad documentation</a> to say that ads in AI Overviews are supported in Australia, Canada, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Malaysia, New Zealand, Nigeria, Pakistan, Philippines, Singapore, and US. Google also added that they are now showing ads in AI Overviews for some sensitive verticals.</p>
<p>The new document lists these 12 countries as where AI Overviews can contain ads:</p>
<ul><li>Australia</li> <li>Canada</li> <li>India</li> <li>Indonesia</li> <li>Kenya</li> <li>Malaysia</li> <li>New Zealand</li> <li>Nigeria</li> <li>Pakistan</li> <li>Philippines</li> <li>Singapore</li> <li>US</li></ul>
<p>Previously, it just <a href="https://www.seroundtable.com/google-ads-help-doc-ai-overviews-39469.html">said it</a> was available in the US and "will expand to select English speaking countries soon."</p>
<p>Google also added "Currently, we don’t show ads in AI Overviews for sensitive verticals like adult, alcohol, gambling, finance, healthcare, politics, and more." So Google won't currently show ads in AI Overviews for queries related to these topics:</p>
<ul><li>Adult</li> <li>Alcohol</li> <li>Gambling</li> <li>Finance</li> <li>Healthcare</li> <li>Politics</li> <li>and more sensitive verticals.</li></ul>
