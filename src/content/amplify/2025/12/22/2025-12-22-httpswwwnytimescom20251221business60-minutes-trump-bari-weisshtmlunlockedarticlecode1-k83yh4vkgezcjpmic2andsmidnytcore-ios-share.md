<p>In a move that drew harsh criticism from its own correspondent, CBS News abruptly removed a segment from Sunday’s episode of “60 Minutes” that was to feature the stories of Venezuelan men deported by the Trump administration to what the program called a “brutal” prison in El Salvador.</p>
<p>The segment was pulled three hours before the broadcast, a highly unusual last-minute change. The decision was made after Bari Weiss, the new editor in chief of CBS News, requested numerous changes to the segment. CBS News said in a statement that the segment would air at a later date and “needed additional reporting.”</p>
<p>But Sharyn Alfonsi, the veteran “60 Minutes” correspondent who reported the segment, rejected that criticism in a private note to CBS colleagues on Sunday, in which she accused CBS News of pulling the segment for “political” reasons.</p>
<p>“Our story was screened five times and cleared by both CBS attorneys and Standards and Practices,” Ms. Alfonsi wrote in the note, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times. “It is factually correct. In my view, pulling it now, after every rigorous internal check has been met, is not an editorial decision, it is a political one.”</p>
<p>The unusual events on Sunday have once again placed “60 Minutes” at the center of a media and political fracas.</p>
<p>Ms. Weiss was appointed in October after David Ellison, the owner of CBS’s parent company, Paramount Skydance, acquired her independent news and opinion site, The Free Press.</p>
<p>Mr. Ellison’s acquisition of Paramount earlier this year was approved by the Trump administration after Paramount paid $16 million <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/02/business/media/paramount-trump-60-minutes-lawsuit.html">to settle a lawsuit</a> that Mr. Trump had brought against “60 Minutes.”</p>
<p>Mr. Ellison is currently making a hostile bid to outmaneuver a rival company, Netflix, and acquire the media behemoth Warner Bros. Discovery. He has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/08/business/media/trump-netflix-paramount-deal.html">courting Mr. Trump’s support</a> for his bid, but the president has used recent episodes of “60 Minutes” to suggest he is displeased with Mr. Ellison’s stewardship of CBS.</p>
<p>CBS News did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Ms. Alfonsi’s note. Reached on Sunday evening, Ms. Alfonsi said: “I refer all questions to Bari Weiss.”</p>
