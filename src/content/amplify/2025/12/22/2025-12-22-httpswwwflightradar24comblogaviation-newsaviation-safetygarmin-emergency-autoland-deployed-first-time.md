title: Garmin Emergency Autoland deployed for the first time
---
<p>On Saturday, 20 December 2025, the Garmin’s Emergency Autoland was used for the first time in a real world emergency situation. The Emergency Autoland system is designed to take control of an aircraft in the event of pilot incapacitation and safely land at a nearby airfield.</p>
<p>That is precisely what happened on Saturday as the pilot of <a href="https://www.flightradar24.com/data/aircraft/n479br#3d97a11e">Beech B200 Super King Air N479BR</a> became incapacitated about 20 minutes after departing Aspen for Denver. The operator of the aircraft, Buffalo River Aviation, tells local media that everyone on board is safe, but did not release any information on the condition of the pilot.</p>

<p>When activated, Garmin’s Emergency Autoland will choose the nearest suitable airfield, configure the aircraft for landing, and contact air traffic control. Upon landing, Emergency Autoland will stop the plane on the runway and shut down the engine(s).</p>
<p>The system computes the optimal landing airport based on distance from current position, runway length and conditions, remaining fuel, and other factors. Once the system designates a landing airport, it begins communicating with air traffic control via automated voice messages.</p>
