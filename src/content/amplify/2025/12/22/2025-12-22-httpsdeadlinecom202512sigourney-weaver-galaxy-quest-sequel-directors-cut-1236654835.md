  Sigourney Weaver Says She Wishes DreamWorks Released A Director’s Cut Of
  ‘Galaxy Quest,’ Reminisces On Sequel That Never Came To Pass

<p>While breaking down her career timeline, <a data-tag="sigourney-weaver" href="https://deadline.com/tag/sigourney-weaver/">Sigourney Weaver</a> reflected on 1999’s satirical sci-fi comedy <em><a data-tag="galaxy-quest" href="https://deadline.com/tag/galaxy-quest/">Galaxy Quest</a></em> and how she wishes the cult favorite had stuck to its initial R-rated guns (or, rather, space lasers).</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6s1ssDMUXZ4">video interview with <em>Vanity Fair</em></a>, the <em>Alien </em>star said she related more to her character Gwen, a has-been actress who resented her objectification in the movie’s bygone space soap opera series, than the steely Ripley in the 1979 Ridley Scott classic.</p>
<p>“I wanted to play a young woman in that world of stardom, who wants so much to be a star and who, because she’s beautiful and bosomy and blonde, no one takes very seriously — not even the commander. And I felt great compassion and sisterhood with Gwen and Tawny [the fictional character she plays in the world of <em>Galaxy Quest</em>].”</p>
<p>Adding that she was “fortunate” to have worked with an “amazing group” of co-stars including Tim Allen, Tony Shalhoub and <a data-tag="alan-rickman" href="https://deadline.com/tag/alan-rickman/">Alan Rickman</a>, the <em>Avatar </em>actress said, “I wish they put out a director’s cut of the movie because, at the last minute, <a data-tag="dreamworks" href="https://deadline.com/tag/dreamworks/">DreamWorks</a> decided to release the movie with some of the more sophisticated scenes cut that Alan was in because it needed a kids’ movie to go up against [Columbia Pictures’] <em>Stuart Little</em>. And why they don’t put out the movie again with more of his very, very strange and wonderful scenes?”</p>
<p>Of the long-discussed sequel that never came to pass, Weaver said, “[Co-writer] Bob Gordon had written a second one, and he wouldn’t give it to DreamWorks because he just felt they’d missed the boat on ours. And so we always meant to do a sequel, and then with Alan passing away, we just lost heart. But it was a great privilege to do this love letter to actors.”</p>
<p>Directed by Dean Parisot, the parody and loving homage to series like <em>Star Trek</em> centers on a group of alumni of a space TV show who are unwittingly drawn into an intergalactic conflict by aliens who believe their imaginary series to be a depiction of real life.</p>
<p>Though sequel discussions have circulated prior to and following Rickman’s death as a result of pancreatic cancer in 2016, potential follow-ups have since stalled. However, OG film producer Mark Johnson told Deadline earlier this year that a <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/05/mark-johnson-greta-gerwig-narnia-galaxy-quest-holdovers-series-1236413994/"><em>Galaxy Quest</em> TV series is currently being written for CBS Studios</a>.</p>
