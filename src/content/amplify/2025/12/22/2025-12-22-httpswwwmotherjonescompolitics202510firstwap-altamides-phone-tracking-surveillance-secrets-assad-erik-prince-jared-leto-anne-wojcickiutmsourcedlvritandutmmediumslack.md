<p>There was one line that the burgeoning private surveillance industry has generally refused to cross. Governments, however reckless or repressive, were seen as fair game. But private clients were off limits. Yet Altamides has made its way into private hands.</p>
<p>In 2013, KCS was preparing a “discreet due diligence” report on oil and gas executive Roberto Casula, who worked at the Italy-based energy multinational Eni. This report, which was sent to Eni’s security head Umberto Saccone, sought information to discredit Casula, including allegations of bribery and criminal association. It was the type of dossier often commissioned from a corporate intelligence firm. But the KCS report came with a twist: “Technical surveillance revealing recent movements.” KCS had used Altamides to track Casula in Italy and on a trip to Libya.</p>
<p>KCS’s Poole-Robb said he “100 percent” denied tracking Casula using Altamides and noted that his company “never used location tracking for anyone in relation to that type of work.” He added, “We tend to work where possible on the side of the angels.” Eni said in a statement that Casula and Saccone “have not worked at Eni for several years” and that it “is not aware of the specific matter and has no further comments on it.” Neither Casula nor Saccone responded to requests for comment.</p>
<p>KCS also deployed Altamides for private clients in other instances: to surveil Italian venture capitalist Alessandro Benedetti on behalf of Egyptian billionaire Naguib Sawiris during <a href="https://www.trusts.it/admincp/UploadedPDF/201010111406300.Benedetti%20v%20Sawiris.pdf">legal wrangling</a> over a telecom deal, and to track Formula 1 journalist <a href="https://joesaward.wordpress.com/">Joe Saward</a> in order to learn if someone was paying him for his critical coverage of Team Lotus. Sawiris did not reply to multiple requests for comment. Dany Bahar, the Lotus executive the Saward report was presented to, said that he had “no knowledge about any surveillance tracking software and such practices nor would I approve such means.”</p>
<p>Cases like these show how easily, once access is given to a powerful location tracking system, its use expands beyond intelligence agencies and law enforcement. Sneaking into phone networks and using them to elicit intelligence about business competitors, litigation opponents, and others becomes another tool in the corporate arsenal.</p>
<p>But even more troublingly, the First Wap archive shows how Altamides was used for purely personal reasons.</p>
<p>Sophia (not her real name) was perplexed when we told her that her old phone number popped up in the logs of a military-grade location tracking system. She was followed for almost a year: at the office, at her home outside London, and even as she walked the beaches of Goa on a rare vacation.</p>
<p>At first she speculated the surveillance might relate to her job—business intelligence for a pharmaceutical multinational—or her background, a Russian immigrant who had been publicly critical of Vladimir Putin and his government. But as she pieced together the story, revisiting old Facebook contacts and assessing the data pattern we found, a disturbing truth emerged.</p>
<p>On arrival in the UK, she needed a new driver’s license. Her company contracted a driving instructor, who gave her lessons while regaling her with stories of his alleged time in the Pakistani military. At first she found him talkative, charming, helpful even. But over time, what had seemed like friendliness began to feel like pursuit. Sophia rebuffed his advances and eventually cut ties with him. But, she said, he continued to call and text her.</p>
<p>Spurred by the recollection, Sophia took another look at her former driving instructor. And she uncovered a crucial detail, which she passed on to us. “A guy with the same name seems to represent a Pakistani surveillance and forensic technology company,” she wrote.</p>
<p>The company was a leading provider of security products to Pakistan’s armed forces. Her driving instructor was one of its sales managers. The First Wap archive shows that Sophia was targeted within minutes of several of his close professional and personal associates, indicating that he was testing the tool on all of them.</p>
<p>A year after she was tracked, Sophia moved from the UK, keeping her old phone number as she resettled. As she prepared to disconnect her number, she listened back to unopened voicemails. One of them was her driving instructor confessing that he had “done wrong things” and “crossed a line.”</p>
<p>More than a decade later, knowing that she was tracked, those comments took on newfound significance. “I feel very vulnerable,” she said. “Like there is no privacy, there is no private safe space where I can just be left alone.”</p>
<p>First Wap has continued to develop Altamides, adding new capabilities. Now it can not only track locations, it can intercept calls and messages and crack accounts that rely on passcodes sent via text messages—including the encrypted messaging service WhatsApp, as Guenther Rudolph told Albert and Abdou, the Lighthouse reporters posing as potential buyers, at the ISS conference in June. The company steers clear of the spyware, highly regarded in the industry, that provides access to everything on a target’s device. It continues to exploit phone networks, which offers more limited surveillance possibilities, but allows First Wap to operate more freely and flexibly than its competitors, Rudolph said.</p>
<p>Expensive hacking tools, he explained during one conversation with Albert, are too short-lived. “As soon as Apple get informed that there’s a vulnerability, they close it with the next patch. So whatever you buy now, in two months you can put your money in the garbage bin.”</p>
<p>Additionally, he said, the media attention that high-end hacking tools have attracted has meant that their vendors now have “ethical principles.”</p>
<p>“They don’t want to get into the newspaper or into the internet and be, okay, another president in Africa who is monitoring the free press or restricting human rights or whatever. So they don’t want this right? Bad marketing for them.”</p>
<p>Rudolph mentioned an Israeli hacking firm, sanctioned by the US on the basis that it had supplied spyware used to target journalists, businesspeople, and activists. Rudolph said he had introduced two new clients to the firm, only to have them rejected—representing a loss to the Israeli firm of tens of millions of dollars of potential business.</p>
<p>“I said, ‘Not bad!’ So they just dumped 100 million, huh? I also want to have this moralistic viewpoint.”</p>
<p>Across hours of discussion over multiple days at the Prague conference, one theme emerged repeatedly, echoing the findings from the First Wap archive: First Wap was prepared to do business with places—and people—that should have been off limits.</p>
<p>“We emphatically reject any allegations that we offer an illegal business model or promote, support, or enable unlawful operations,” First Wap said in a statement.</p>
<p>One scenario Albert and Abdou discussed with Rudolph in detail was that of a mining company facing problems from environmental activists looking to disrupt its business. How could First Wap help their West African client? Rudolph’s response was pragmatic. “He knows already who are the leaders, or he wants to find out?”</p>
<p>The mining company would need to organize connectivity with a local phone operator, which typically means that someone in government has to sign off. But “if they could bring us the connectivity, then we can deliver,” Rudolph said.</p>
<p>Other companies would not do this, he added, because it would contravene laws around exports of surveillance technology that are in force in Europe, Israel, and America—but not in Indonesia.</p>
<p>“I think we’re the only one who can deliver,” he said.</p>
<p>The next day, Rudolph, along with Jonny Goebel, now First Wap’s owner, described how they could structure the delivery of a tracking system in order to circumvent sanctions or export controls.</p>
<p>They would sell Altamides to Albert’s firm, which would in turn resell the technology to a South African shell company, newly established by his customer for this purpose. The sales contract would state that the shell company could resell the system to an unspecified law enforcement agency. First Wap could then claim ignorance about who ended up using the system. It was, according to Goebel, a “dark grey area.” But it was “the only thing” that can “somehow protect us.”</p>
<p>The shell company “should not be owned by somebody who’s on the sanction list,” he cautioned, bursting into laughter.</p>
<p>In September, Goebel and Rudolph joined a video call with the undercover reporter posing as Albert to go through next steps on the proposal they had discussed in Prague three months earlier.</p>
<p>Albert pressed for a price range. “It depends on what the client chooses on the different features and the number of operators,” Goebel replied. “It can start, let’s say, minimum one million…It can get up to 15 to 20 million theoretically, if they buy all the features in there.”</p>
<p>Moments later, Albert revealed himself as a journalist. The call went silent.</p>
