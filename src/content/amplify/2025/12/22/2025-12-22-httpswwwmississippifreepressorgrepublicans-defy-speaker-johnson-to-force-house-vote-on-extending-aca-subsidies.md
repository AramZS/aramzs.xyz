<p>WASHINGTON (AP)—Four centrist Republicans broke with Speaker Mike Johnson on Wednesday and signed onto a Democratic-led petition that will force a House vote on extending for three years an enhanced pandemic-era subsidy that lowers health insurance costs for millions of Americans.</p>
<p>The stunning move comes after House Republican leaders pushed ahead with a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/republican-house-health-care-plan-obamacare-subsidies-208b30670d0486c8d27ceb59c59003e0">health care bill</a> that does not address the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/shutdown-health-tax-credits-affordable-care-act-2b5ae3651ff16783a00e00dc1ce264bf" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">soaring monthly premiums</a> that millions of people will soon endure when the tax credits for those who buy insurance through the Affordable Care Act expire at year’s end.</p>
<p>Democrats led by Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York needed 218 signatures to force a floor vote on their bill, which would extend the subsidies for three years.</p>
<p>Republican Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick, Robert Bresnahan and Ryan Mackenzie, all from Pennsylvania, and Mike Lawler of New York signed on Wednesday morning, pushing it to the magic number of 218. A vote on the subsidy bill could come as soon as January under House rules.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, it is House leadership themselves that have forced this outcome.” Fitzpatrick said in a statement.</p>
<h3><strong>Origins of a Republican Revolt</strong></h3>
<p>The revolt against GOP leadership came after days of talks centered on the health care subsidies.</p>
<p><a href="https://apnews.com/hub/mike-johnson/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Johnson</a>, R-La., had discussed allowing more politically vulnerable GOP lawmakers a chance to vote on bills that would temporarily extend the subsidies while also adding changes such as income caps for beneficiaries. But after days of discussions, the leadership sided with the more conservative wing of the party’s conference, which has assailed the subsidies as propping up a failed marketplace through the ACA, which is widely known as “Obamacare.”</p>
<p>House Republicans pushed ahead Wednesday a 100-plus-page health care package without the subsidies, instead focusing on long-sought GOP proposals designed to expand insurance coverage options for small businesses and the self-employed.</p>
<p>Fitzpatrick and Lawler tried to add a temporary extension of the subsidies to the bill, but were denied.</p>
<p>“Our only request was a floor vote on this compromise, so that the American People’s voice could be heard on this issue. That request was rejected. Then, at the request of House leadership I, along with my colleagues, filed multiple amendments, and testified at length to those amendments,” Fitzpatrick said. “House leadership then decided to reject every single one of these amendments.</p>
<p>“As I’ve stated many times before, the only policy that is worse than a clean three-year extension without any reforms, is a policy of complete expiration without any bridge,” Fitzpatrick said.</p>
<p>Lawler, in a social media post, similarly said that “the failure of leadership” to permit a vote had left him with “no choice” but to sign the petition. He urged Johnson to bring the plan up for an immediate floor vote.</p>
<h3><strong>Path Ahead Is Uncertain</strong></h3>
<p>Even if the subsidy bill were to pass the House, which is far from assured, it would face an arduous climb in the Republican-led Senate.</p>
<p>Republicans last week <a href="https://apnews.com/article/health-care-vote-affordable-care-act-obamacare-6ffc1ea9f878c6b3da995589ef8a012c" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">voted down</a> a three-year extension of the subsidies and proposed an alternative that also failed. But in an encouraging sign for Democrats, four Republican senators crossed party lines to support their proposal.</p>
<p>Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., argued against the Democratic extension as “an attempt to disguise the real impact of Obamacare’s spiraling health care costs.”</p>
