<html><body><figure><img src="https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/wapo/XSYJH2W4SCK2TSERDKLMLCQS4U.JPG"/><figcaption>Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) on July 9 at the Capitol.</figcaption></figure><p>Sen. Ted Cruz sat down with a longtime ally in November at an office near D.C.’s Union Station to discuss the future of the Republican Party. Before long, the discussion touched on his own future.</p><p>His friend Morton Klein, president of the Zionist Organization for America, told Cruz he believed that “Jew hatred and Israel bashing” was on the rise on the right — and that something had to be done about it. Cruz, who had begun a series of speeches decrying antisemitism in the GOP, told Klein he had been fielding requests from people urging him to run for president in 2028.</p><p>Cruz came across as someone “seriously” considering such a run, Klein recalled.</p><p>With the future of the party up for grabs in a Donald Trump-less 2028 primary, Cruz has in recent months positioned himself as a loud voice for a more traditional, hawkish Republican foreign policy. He’s also urging the GOP to rid itself of popular MAGA pundit Tucker Carlson, who he argues is <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/10/31/carlson-fuentes-heritage-antisemitism/" target="_blank">injecting the “poison” of antisemitism into the movement</a> with his broadsides against Israel. Carlson has rejected that characterization.</p><p>As he feuds with Carlson, Cruz is weighing a second presidential bid, according to a person close to the senator and another briefed on his thinking, who spoke like others on the condition of anonymity to disclose internal conversations. A White House run would be politically risky for Cruz, 55, putting him on course to collide with Vice President JD Vance, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/03/08/10-republicans-who-could-be-trumps-heir-apparent-2028/" target="_blank">whom many Republicans expect to enter the 2028 race</a>.</p><p>Friction is already evident behind the scenes: Cruz has criticized Vance, a close ally of Carlson, to Republican donors, according to two people familiar with the comments. The senator has warned that <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/2024/07/16/jd-vance-foreign-policy/" target="_blank">Vance’s foreign policy views</a> are dangerously isolationist, the people said.<b> </b>(Vance has been one of the GOP’s most prominent skeptics of U.S. intervention abroad.)</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/wapo/YKZNGVW6TE4RDK6FTHZZRDTLOU.jpg"/><figcaption>Vice President JD Vance leads early polls in the potential 2028 Republican presidential field. (Sarah L. Voisin/The Washington Post)</figcaption></figure><p>The emerging rivalry shows how much the party has changed under Trump’s leadership since Cruz arrived in the Senate in 2013. After rising to prominence as a rebel against the establishment, Cruz is now a vocal champion of some longtime orthodox GOP positions, as a new generation of conservatives is ascending with a different vision.</p><p>Some political observers are skeptical that another Cruz run would gain much traction. He can no longer run as an outsider and alienated some conservatives with his fight against Trump in the 2016 campaign. Still, Cruz has built name recognition and relationships with plenty of activists and donors across the country in recent years, and it’s far from clear what will animate the base in the next GOP primary.</p><p>“Can Ted help craft or meld together the traditional Republican approach with the new reality of what the Republican Party is now?” asked Daron Shaw, a political science professor at the University of Texas who overlapped with Cruz as a staffer on George W. Bush’s presidential<b> </b>campaign. “It’s a heavy lift.”</p><p class="rw-outer-content"><span>Some content could not be imported from the original document.</span> <a href="https://washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/12/22/ted-cruz-president-2028-vance-maga/">View content ↗ </a></p><p>The day after his chat with Klein, Cruz called Carlson “a coward” during a speech before a group supporting Jewish conservatives in Las Vegas, again denouncing the “poisonous lies” of antisemitism. He said they were “blessed” to have Trump, who “loves the Jewish people,” in the White House right now.</p><p>“When Trump is not in the White House, what then?” he asked in his booming voice.</p><p>“Ted Cruz!” an audience member shouted.</p><p>The senator just smiled, then continued his speech.</p><h3>‘All of us hate Ted Cruz’</h3><p>Anyone considering a run for the GOP nomination in 2028 faces a big obstacle: Vance.</p><p>The 41-year-old vice president leads early polls and is seen as a loyal lieutenant to Trump, who maintains high support from the party base even as the president’s approval ratings have plummeted.</p><p>But Trump has been noncommittal about endorsing his running mate as heir to his Make America Great Again movement, leaving an opening for an ambitious conservative with a different vision for the party.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/wapo/7SLO2SBKE4U3OIYT3CXA523WPM.JPG"/><figcaption>Cruz wears Senate-themed boots in May at the Capitol. (Tom Brenner/For The Washington Post)</figcaption></figure><p>“The Republicans will be fighting for their identity,” Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Georgia) said of the 2028 primary. Greene, a close ally of Carlson who represents the populist and isolationist wing of the party, added: “There’ll be Ted Cruz, I’m sure, running against JD Vance. All of us hate Ted Cruz.”</p><p>Cruz has adapted to changes in his party over several decades in politics. Following a stretch in the establishment during Bush’s 2000 campaign, he became solicitor general of Texas in 2003 and launched a Senate campaign in 2011 as a tea-party-infused change agent, defeating the lieutenant governor in the GOP primary.</p><p>“The best thing to happen to the Republican Party was to get its teeth kicked in in 2008,” Cruz said during a 2012 campaign event with the libertarian Ron Paul.</p><p>When he arrived in Washington, Cruz picked fights over spending and President Barack Obama’s health care law, sparking a government shutdown in 2013. Not everyone in his party liked his style. “If you killed Ted Cruz on the floor of the Senate, and the trial was in the Senate, nobody could convict you,” Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina) joked at a 2016 press dinner.</p><p>Cruz brought his insurgent pitch into the 2016 presidential race, but Trump caught fire with an antiestablishment campaign that dramatically eclipsed the senator’s. After <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/ted-cruz-drops-out-of-the-republican-presidential-race/2016/05/03/8f955a06-0fe7-11e6-81b4-581a5c4c42df_story.html" target="_blank">bowing out of the GOP race as the last major Trump opponent standing</a>, Cruz told delegates at the Republican National Convention that year to “vote your conscience,” <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/as-trump-captures-gop-nomination-former-rivals-prepare-to-take-the-stage/2016/07/20/13e5c4c0-4e23-11e6-a422-83ab49ed5e6a_story.html" target="_blank">instead of throwing his support behind Trump</a>, who had branded him as “Lyin’ Ted.” He returned to the Senate, where he is now chair of the Commerce Committee and has refashioned himself into a bipartisan dealmaker on aviation safety and other issues.</p><p>The Texas senator, who has called himself a “noninterventionist hawk” and has long been a vocal ally of Israel, argues that an anti-Israel foreign policy could embolden terrorists. And he is a defender of the benefits of traditional capitalism at a time when some in the “New Right” are calling for a more populist turn.</p><p>“Those who are anti-Israel quickly become anti-capitalist and anti-American,” Cruz said in a brief interview about his decision to speak out against Carlson. “Tucker’s obsession is unhealthy and dangerous.”</p><p>By targeting Carlson and growing anti-Israel sentiment within the party, Cruz has hit upon a division within the GOP base that some believe could animate the 2028 primaries. Carlson is closely allied with Vance, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/2024/07/15/jd-vance-trump-criticism/" target="_blank">a onetime Trump critic who is now an “America First” populist</a>, embracing skepticism of some big-business interests and rejecting the U.S. foreign policy status quo.</p><p>Cruz is staking out positions against isolationism and antisemitism at a time when explicitly antisemitic figures such as <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/11/08/nick-fuentes-tucker-carlson-hate-speech/" target="_blank">white supremacist commentator Nick Fuentes</a> are gaining an audience on the right.</p><p>Vance, by contrast,<b> </b>has <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/12/22/jd-vance-israel-maga-debate/" target="_blank">rejected the suggestion that the right has a problem with antisemitism</a> after<b> </b>Carlson hosted Fuentes for a friendly interview. (<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/12/20/tucker-carlson-maga-trump-fuentes-antisemitism/" target="_blank">The vice president disavowed Fuentes</a> months before the interview and has not explicitly weighed in on <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/10/31/carlson-fuentes-heritage-antisemitism/" target="_blank">Carlson hosting him</a>.)</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/wapo/PPCQX2HB2LP7NPRVTUDVPNBEBI.JPG"/><figcaption>Cruz in 2013, during his first Senate term, at the Capitol. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)</figcaption></figure><p>It’s “kind of slanderous to say that the Republican Party, the conservative movement, is extremely antisemitic,”<b> </b>Vance<b> </b>said in a recent interview with NBC News. In a social media post<b> </b>last week, Vance criticized a news article claiming antisemitism was rising among young people.</p><p>“I would say there’s a difference between not liking Israel (or disagreeing with a given Israeli policy) and antisemitism,” he replied to one user.</p><p>Asked to respond to Vance’s comment, Cruz said he is not in agreement with “people who are anti-Israel or people who are antisemitic.”</p><p>“Every Hamas or Hezbollah or IRGC terrorist that Israel took out makes Americans safer,” Cruz<b> </b>said, referencing militants in Gaza, Lebanon and Iran that the United States designates as terrorist groups. “And those who don’t see that are not acting in accordance with American national security interests.”</p><h3>The feud</h3><p>In early July, Cruz sat down in Washington with Israel’s prime minister and delivered a dire warning. Over cigars at Blair House, Cruz told Benjamin Netanyahu that antisemitism on the right was rising to a level he had never seen before.</p><p>“No, Ted,” Netanyahu responded, according to Cruz, who recounted the conversation in a speech. “That’s Qatar, that’s Iran, that’s astroturf, that’s paid for.”</p><p>But Cruz said he was not placated. Replies to his social media posts were flooded with anti-Jewish bigotry from what looked to him like ordinary, real people. He began to fear that what he saw as antisemitism on the left was beginning to infect the right, he said.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/wapo/HUWUDDE4SQTEOAH72HCRDSPGM4.jpg"/><figcaption>Tucker Carlson during inauguration festivities in Washington on Jan. 20. (Pete Kiehart/For The Washington Post)</figcaption></figure><p>In June, Cruz sat for an interview with Carlson that grew heated over the topic of Israel. Cruz suggested that Carlson criticizes Israel more than other countries because of bigotry toward Jews. Carlson said he has many Jewish friends who have the same questions as him and grilled Cruz with factual questions on the Middle East. In an uncharacteristic lapse, Cruz failed to identify the population of Iran. “You don’t know the population of the country you seek to topple?” Carlson asked.</p><p>Since then, the two have savaged each other in increasingly personal terms. Carlson has called Cruz “vulgar and dumb and reckless” for connecting U.S. military support for Israel to a biblical responsibility to defend the Holy Land and God’s chosen people. After Carlson hosted Fuentes on his podcast this fall, Cruz called on Republicans to repudiate the pundit.</p><p>Carlson “decided Jews are the source of all evil in the world,” Cruz said in a recent podcast. The senator also posted a digitally altered sexually suggestive photo of Carlson to critique his friendly stance toward Qatar, a U.S. ally with which Israel has clashed.</p><p>Since the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/09/10/charlie-kirk-dead/" target="_blank">killing of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk</a>, internal battles about the future of the GOP have spilled into the open, many centering on the true meaning of “America First” as Trump spends time and political capital on Ukraine, Israel and Venezuela. Carlson criticized <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/06/21/b-2-bombers-iran-trump/" target="_blank">Trump’s decision to strike Iran’s nuclear sites</a> in June and has warned the president against <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/12/10/cia-latin-america-trump-venezuela/" target="_blank">pursuing regime change in Venezuela</a>, a goal Cruz shares.</p><p>“What Ted is trying to do is say, this is where our voters are,” said one person close to the senator. “Trump and Ted are much more aligned on foreign policy than Trump and Tucker are.”</p><p>Few Republicans have publicly rallied to Cruz’s side.</p><p>“I can tell you, my colleagues, almost to a person, think what is happening is horrifying,” Cruz said in one speech on Carlson. “But a great many of them are frightened because he has one hell of a big megaphone.”</p><p>Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-Texas) said he “applauds” Cruz for speaking out against Carlson. But others declined to weigh in.</p><p>Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-Alabama), a close Trump ally, said he believes the back-and-forth is personal. “Sometimes when you get embarrassed, you get mad, get your feelings hurt,” he said.</p><p>Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Connecticut) said he is surprised but happy that Cruz has the “courage” to challenge such a powerful figure on the right. “To give Senator Cruz due credit, it requires some guts and gumption to stand up against Tucker Carlson,” he said.</p><p>As Carlson and Cruz have attacked each other, Trump has declined to take sides, calling Carlson a “nice guy” and Cruz a “good friend” in recent months.</p><p>Carlson has said he thinks “antisemitism is immoral, and I am against it.” He argues the feud is just politics. “All [Cruz] wants is to be president. That’s all he’s ever wanted,” Carlson said in an interview. “As a political matter, he somehow thinks that calling me a Nazi is going to get him the nomination because it’s going to hurt JD Vance.” (Cruz has not publicly used that word to described Carlson.)</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/wapo/FDDACNWIR762D3QKKEMD7R5TUM.JPG"/><figcaption>Trump supporters at a 2024 Phoenix event where Carlson interviewed the then-presidential candidate. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)</figcaption></figure><p>Rep. Ryan Zinke (R-Montana), who argued that Cruz damaged his credibility with conservatives after spurning Trump in 2016 but later recovered his standing, said Cruz “always has an eye on running.”</p><p>“Ted stakes out his position pretty well, and so were he to run, we know where he is,” Zinke said.</p><p>So far, there are few signs that Cruz is gaining an advantage. Hal Lambert, a major GOP donor who helped organize a super PAC to support Cruz when he ran for president in 2016, said he thinks a 2028 bid would be tricky for the senator.</p><p>“If JD Vance is running, I’m going to be supporting JD Vance,” Lambert said.</p><p>“I just don’t understand what the platform would be,” he said of Cruz’s potential run. “The platform would be, I’m Ted, and that’s JD?”</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/wapo/M3PSZDZKG4JTD6BZM5NKH6YQLQ.JPG"/><figcaption>Cruz in 2013 at the Capitol.
