<p>Now that EV tax incentives have <a href="https://www.edmunds.com/fuel-economy/the-ins-and-outs-of-electric-vehicle-tax-credits.html">gone up in smoke</a>, Tesla is <a href="https://insideevs.com/news/782155/tesla-poor-sales-in-2025/">expected to disappoint</a> <a href="https://futurism.com/things-looking-bad-tesla-q2">once again</a> with its Q4 sales.</p>
<p>Despite a pessimistic sales forecast, Tesla’s shares have skyrocketed and are up almost 50 percent over the last six months — showing yet again how the company’s $1.5 trillion market cap is <a href="https://nypost.com/2025/12/01/business/big-short-icon-michael-burry-unloads-on-elon-musk-calls-tesla-ridiculously-overvalued/">largely untethered</a> from the success of its core business.</p>
<p>But that hasn’t stopped Tesla CEO Elon Musk from seemingly putting his thumb on the scales. As an insider source <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/12/18/elon-musks-spacex-bought-tens-of-millions-worth-of-cybertrucks-tesla-cant-sell/">told <em>Electrek</em></a>, the billionaire’s space company SpaceX has bought over 1,000 Cybertrucks from Tesla, a number that could rise to 2,000 over time.</p>
<p>In other words, one of Musk’s other companies has allegedly spent north of $100 million on Teslas that it’s hard to imagine it finding a use for — and in what looks an awful lot like an <a href="https://futurism.com/advanced-transport/elon-musk-sell-cybertruck-a-huge-number-to-himself">embarrassing ploy</a> to save face for the EV maker.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://x.com/Ellieinspace/status/2000612387179671932?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E2000612387179671932%7Ctwgr%5Ec0a4ca22b3e50e55a4ea508e5612dc3d493b837b%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Felectrek.co%2F2025%2F12%2F18%2Felon-musks-spacex-bought-tens-of-millions-worth-of-cybertrucks-tesla-cant-sell%2F">video</a> circulating on Musk’s social media platform, X, shows an enormous number of Cybertrucks parked outside of SpaceX’s facilities in South Texas.</p>
<p>Considering the pickup EV has been an enormous commercial flop, only selling barely a fraction of Musk’s promised <a href="https://futurism.com/advanced-transport/cybertruck-lead-leaving-tesla">250,000 to 500,000 Cybertrucks a year</a>, there’s a good chance Tesla is using the mercurial CEO’s other venture to boost the numbers ahead of the end of an otherwise disastrous year.</p>
<p>As Musk continues to <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/data-elon-musk-alienated-tesla-core-buyers">alienate his customers</a> following his embrace of far-right ideologies, the company is struggling to close sales. Tesla’s US sales dropped to a nearly four-year low in November, as <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-us-sales-drop-nearly-3-year-low-november-despite-launch-cheaper-versions-2025-12-11/"><em>Reuters</em> reported</a> last week. A cheaper, stripped-down version of its Model Y SUV failed to reverse the downward trend.</p>
<p>According to registration data, the company <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/elon-musk-calls-cybertruck-teslas-223106324.html">sold just 5,385 Cybertrucks</a> in the US in Q3, a precipitous drop of 62 percent compared to the same period last year.</p>
<p>Apart from being a major commercial flop, the Cybertruck has also been <a href="https://futurism.com/tesla-cybertruck-recall-piece-flying-off">recalled eight times</a> for sometimes-glaring design issues, and criticized for its <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/cybertruck-real-world-range-feeble">relatively low range</a> and much <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/cybertruck-actual-price">higher than originally advertised price</a>.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Musk is adamant that the truck is a success story, <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1996484482514428311?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1996484482514428311%7Ctwgr%5E659b1707eaf9ae9ebe9cf3e2bd3f1276e162d2ca%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ffinance.yahoo.com%2Fnews%2Felon-musk-calls-cybertruck-teslas-223106324.html">tweeting earlier this month</a> that it’s an “incredible vehicle” and “our best ever from Tesla.”</p>
<p>How committed the EV maker still is to producing the stainless steel monstrosity remains to be seen. Musk has been trying to transition Tesla away from selling traditional vehicles, <a href="https://futurism.com/future-society/teslas-robotaxi-plans-jumble">doubling down on a robotaxi service</a> and <a href="https://futurism.com/former-tesla-robotics-boss-elon-musk-optimus">humanoid robots</a> instead.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Tesla’s core business is looking worse for wear. Beyond drying up demand, the company is facing fresh regulatory headwinds, with California <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/12/17/business/california-may-halt-tesla-sales-autopilot">threatening the company with a 30-day car sales ban</a> in the state for misleading its customers with the term “Autopilot.”</p>
<p>Despite its erroneous marketing terms, Tesla vehicles — at least the <a href="https://futurism.com/advanced-transport/tesla-removing-safety-drivers-robotaxis">ones being sold to the public</a> — are not able to fully drive themselves, and require the driver to be able to take over control at any time.</p>
