<p>The infant botulism outbreak that sickened dozens of babies who drank <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/11/14/byheart-baby-formula-fda-recall-company-response-criticized/">ByHeart formula</a> is a reminder of how vulnerable we all are to the companies that sell us food — and how important it is to have a robust food safety system that responds quickly to problems and prevents illness in the first place.</p>
<p>But federal cuts this year will leave more people exposed to potential foodborne illness in the future, food safety experts predict. The changes they say will degrade U.S. food safety include the <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cdc-quietly-scaled-back-surveillance-program-foodborne-illnesses-rcna227089">reduced number of pathogens</a> now monitored by a key surveillance program, brain drain of the foodborne illness staff at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Food and Drug Administration amid low morale and overwork, and cuts to the administrative staff who support FDA inspectors, which agency officials say has already led to a <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/foreign-food-safety-inspections-historic-low-fda">historic low in inspections</a> of foreign facilities that import food to the U.S.</p>
<p>“It’s not that they [the Trump administration] are necessarily choosing to harm the system,” said Daniel Jernigan, who worked at the CDC for 30 years before <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/08/28/profiles-cdc-officials-who-resigned-in-protest/">resigning</a> from his position as head of the agency’s National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases in August. “It’s that all of these cuts that are not coherent are all working against each other, and therefore you end up with a system that’s just not functioning well.”</p>
<p>As it is, foodborne illness causes around <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/food-safety/about/index.html">48 million illnesses and 3,000 deaths</a> in the U.S. each year.</p>
<p>The Trump administration has taken some measures to try to protect food safety, restoring funding to states to carry out more inspections, said Sarah Sorscher, director of regulatory affairs at the consumer advocacy group Center for Science in the Public Interest. Nonetheless, she said, the cumulative effect of the cuts is to make food safety “collateral damage in this war on government.”</p>
<p>She added, “Consumers are certainly going to feel it when they get sick from outbreaks that could have been prevented.”</p>
<h2>The cost of scaling back FoodNet</h2>
<p>One significant area of concern is the Trump administration’s decision to scale back the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/foodnet/about/index.html">Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network</a>, or FoodNet, program, reducing the number of pathogens in its reporting requirements from eight to two — salmonella and E. coli. Ten state health departments participate in the FoodNet program, which surveys about 16% of the U.S. population with the goal of detecting outbreaks early and tracking down their sources.</p>
<p>The CDC <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cdc-quietly-scaled-back-surveillance-program-foodborne-illnesses-rcna227089">cited funding issues</a> as a reason for the change and said that other CDC systems also conduct national surveillance for the pathogens. “Narrowing FoodNet’s reporting requirements and associated activities will allow FoodNet staff to prioritize core activities,” a CDC spokesperson told STAT.</p>

<p>But experts said that what makes FoodNet unique is that it conducts active surveillance, reaching out to state laboratories to ask about cases, rather than passively relying on states to notify the CDC about illness.</p>
<p>FoodNet is “the best measure we have for whether the system is working or failing us,” said Sorscher. “So the fact that they cut that first is just really dark.”</p>
<p>The fault doesn’t just lie with the Trump administration, said Sorscher — Congress has also failed to provide sufficient funding to detect and prevent foodborne illness. (The CDC typically requests a budget of $72 million a year for food safety, about half of which goes to states.)</p>
<p>With FoodNet cuts, Sorscher said, “what’s being lost is accuracy and the ability to compare [trends] over time.” That means “we will not be able to say with any certainty moving forward what the DOGE [Department of Government Efficiency] cuts did, what the shutdown did. So it really just wipes away any form of accountability for these other changes.”</p>
<p>Carlota Medus, supervisor of the foodborne diseases unit at the Minnesota Department of Health, said via email that the immediate impact of cuts to FoodNet in the state could be the speed with which his department is able to identify the source of an outbreak. “Long term, the cuts will affect our ability to use surveillance data to better understand risks in the food supply, and which areas food producers and regulatory agencies should prioritize,” she said.</p>
<h2>Brain drain, pipeline problems, and low morale</h2>
<p>Food inspectors at the FDA weren’t targeted by federal cuts. But <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/federal-health-worker-cuts-rfk-trump-administration/?_gl=1*wz6vu1*_ga*MTA1NzkzMTMyOS4xNzYxNzQzNjY2*_ga_K9RW8M6GL5*czE3NjU4MTkyOTUkbzExJGcxJHQxNzY1ODE5MzI4JGoyNyRsMCRoMA..">65% of support staff</a> charged with tasks like booking and reimbursing travel were eliminated. Jernigan compares the loss of support staff to a person trying to use a banking app on a smartphone that needs a software update. “The app may be perfectly fine,” he said, “but if you don’t have the operating system on the phone, you’re not going to be able to use the app.”</p>
<p>There was already a chronic shortage of food inspectors at the FDA and the Department of Agriculture, said Barbara Kowalcyk, director of the Institute for Food Safety and Nutrition Security at George Washington University. Now morale is low, experienced inspectors are retiring or leaving for the private sector, and the people who remain are overextended.</p>
<p>“The staffing losses and the brain drain is huge,” said Sorscher. “The inspection is only as good as the person doing it, and we’re losing so many experienced staff.” The FDA food inspection workforce is about 20% understaffed, with 470 out of a ceiling of 589 positions filled, the agency told consumer groups last week. The infant formula team has only 5 inspector positions filled out of 10, though there are 11 traditional inspectors who can also examine facilities. There’s no hiring freeze on inspectors — the problem is recruiting and retaining staff.</p>

<p>The FDA reassured consumer groups that current staffing was adequate in spite of being below the budgeted ceiling, Sorscher said. “No specifics really, just seemed like they were trying to keep a stiff upper lip for external partners,” she added.</p>
<p>In her own view, “[e]ven if they’re able to bring in new people, it’s going to take years to have the level of competency we had before Trump took office.”</p>
<p>ProPublica reported last month that, in the aftermath of support staff cuts, the FDA will have the <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/foreign-food-safety-inspections-historic-low-fda">lowest number of inspections of imported food</a> since 2011, excluding the pandemic. “That’s particularly concerning,” Kowalcyk said, because a lot of fruits and vegetables are imported into the U.S., and “fresh produce is our riskiest product” when it comes to foodborne illness.</p>
<p>Imported foods “don’t have the same level of regulation when it comes to things like irrigation water and food safety practices,” Kowalcyk said. Back in 2008, for example, a nationwide salmonella outbreak that led to hundreds of hospitalizations and two deaths was eventually traced back to contaminated irrigation water used to <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1005741">grow peppers</a> in Mexico.</p>
<p>Food safety experts also predict pipeline problems for years to come as students who might normally seek out jobs in government look for private sector roles instead. “If a student were to come to me today to say, ‘Hey, I’m considering a career in the federal government in food safety,’ I might say, ‘Maybe not right now,’” said Don Schaffner, a distinguished professor of food science at Rutgers University.</p>
<p>Brain drain among food safety experts at the CDC is underway as well. That’s a problem because state health departments rely on the CDC to identify and manage responses to foodborne illness that affects people across state lines, according to Medus of the Minnesota foodborne diseases unit. “With a decrease in expertise and capacity at the CDC, it will be harder to coordinate the investigation efforts across the U.S.,” and harder to arrive at answers about the root cause of outbreaks, Medus said.</p>
<p>Jernigan also noted that DOGE cut a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/orr/topics-programs/orise-fellowship.html">CDC fellowship program</a> with the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education that provided training to young people who often went on to become junior employees at the agency, including in food safety. “It was a significant cut to the incoming pipeline for young scientists, and I think we’ll be feeling that impact for years,” Jernigan said.</p>
<p>The entire staff of 40 or so people in the CDC’s Washington office, which coordinated communication between the agency and Congress, also <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/10/11/cdc-firings-government-shutdown-hhs/">lost their jobs</a> in October. That means policymakers on appropriation and oversight committees may not be getting the information they need about outbreaks and other issues, Jernigan said.</p>
<h2>How funding cuts are weakening food safety</h2>
<p>State health departments do most of the initial work on foodborne illness, but they’re heavily dependent on CDC funding. It’s hard to lay out exactly how those cuts have impacted state food safety efforts, said Sorscher, because states’ work is largely funded through federal block grants that can be allocated for a wide range of purposes. “Those grants have decreased dramatically and they’ve probably had to make layoffs, but we can’t really follow the money,” she said.</p>
<p>One change that Jernigan said has definitely weakened the food safety system is the <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/26/trump-pulls-back-billions-covid-funding-local-health-departments/">rescission of Covid-related funding</a> and the fallout effect on <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/advanced-molecular-detection/index.html">Advanced Molecular Detection</a>, a CDC program that allows state health departments to use newer genomic sequencing techniques rather than older methods of microbiology.</p>
<aside><figure><img alt="" src="https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Morning-Rounds-Logo-Black-640x295.png"/></figure></aside>
<p>For foodborne illness, that could mean that when a sick person shows up at the hospital and their stool sample tests positive for salmonella, the sample then gets sent to a state public health laboratory to sequence that particular bacteria. Two weeks later, if someone in another state gets sick, the sequencing would be able to identify a match between the two cases and, from there, help investigators more speedily identify the source of contamination.</p>
<p>“The taking back of those dollars meant that they no longer had money in state health departments to pay for the people doing the sequencing,” Jernigan said. As a result, he said, “what you will see is later detection of outbreaks, and probably larger numbers of cases.”</p>
<h2>How we’ll know if the food safety system is breaking down</h2>
<p>One challenge with communicating the importance of food safety, said Kowalcyk, is that it’s fundamentally about prevention. “If we’re doing our jobs right, you don’t ever see it.”</p>
<p>It may be hard to see the impact of cuts, too. “If you stop looking for things, then you will not find them,” said Jernigan. “Your overall foodborne illness rate will start going down. Yay! No, that’s bad.” Fewer outbreaks, with larger numbers of cases, could be one sign of worsening food safety.</p>
<p>Beyond foodborne illness, a side effect of the cuts may be to discourage Americans from eating fresh food. “If we have a lot of fresh produce outbreaks, that’s going to reduce consumer confidence,” Kowalcyk said. Ultra-processed foods, by contrast, “tend to be pretty safe because they’ve had preservatives added to them and are shelf-stable.”</p>
<p>Overall, experts said, food safety and nutrition go hand in hand. “We’re supposedly trying to make America healthy again,” said Schaffner. “And that’s hard to do without people that understand food safety.”</p>
