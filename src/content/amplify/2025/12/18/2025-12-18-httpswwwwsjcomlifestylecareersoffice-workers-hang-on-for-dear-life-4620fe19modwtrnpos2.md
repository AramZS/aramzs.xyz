<div><strong data-type="emphasis">White-collar workers are hanging onto their jobs for dear life,</strong> <a data-type="link" href="https://www.wsj.com/economy/jobs/white-collar-workers-job-anxiety-d8f83885?mod=article_inline">spooked by high-profile layoff announcements</a>, the rise of AI and an unforgiving job market for the unemployed. </div><p></p>
<div><strong data-type="emphasis">What does a “knowledge architect” even do?</strong> More Americans have jobs that didn’t even exist a generation ago, which has   <a data-type="link" href="https://www.wsj.com/lifestyle/careers/youre-a-knowledge-architect-why-modern-careers-are-so-hard-to-explain-b0bc2407?mod=article_inline">made careers more difficult to describe</a>, writes Callum Borchers. </div><p></p>
<div><strong data-type="emphasis">These jobs could crop up in our AI future.</strong> Though there will surely be many occupations that we can’t even imagine today,   <a data-type="link" href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/new-jobs-ai-future-fefd4b35?mod=article_inline">here are four that seem possible</a>, writes New York University’s Robert Seaman. </div><p></p>

<div><strong data-type="emphasis">Too many bosses take a hands-off approach when delegating</strong>, and then get frustrated when things go awry.

<div><strong data-type="emphasis">Human-resources departments often don’t live up to employees’ expectations</strong> because   <a data-type="link" href="https://www.wsj.com/lifestyle/careers/hr-departments-employees-expectations-68ff8885?mod=article_inline">workers want more than a transactional relationship</a> with their HR colleagues, writes Glenn Ruffenach. </div><p></p>
<div><strong data-type="emphasis">OpenAI shortened its “vesting cliff” for new employees,</strong> a shift in compensation policy that’s   <a data-type="link" href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/openai-ends-vesting-cliff-for-new-employees-in-compensation-policy-change-d4c4c2cd?mod=article_inline">meant to help retain new hires</a> from leaving in the midst of a fierce talent war. </div><p></p>
<h3 data-type="hed">The Big Number</h3>
