  Migrate your existing 1Password data from standalone vaults to a 1Password
  account
---
<p>If you don’t need to migrate your existing data to a 1Password account, you can still <a href="https://support.1password.com/move-copy-items/">move and copy items between vaults</a>.</p>
<p>1Password 7 and earlier supported <a href="https://support.1password.com/1password-glossary/#primary-vault">standalone vaults</a>, which stored information locally on your device outside of a 1Password account. 1Password 8 requires a <a href="https://support.1password.com/explore/membership/">1Password membership</a>. If you see a <a href="https://support.1password.com/1password-glossary/#primary-vault">Primary vault</a> in the 1Password app, follow the instructions below to sign up for an account and migrate your information.</p>
<h2>Step 1: Sign up or join an account</h2>
<p>You can sign up for an account on <a href="https://1password.com/pricing/password-manager">1Password.com</a>, <a href="https://1password.ca/pricing/password-manager">1Password.ca</a>, or <a href="https://1password.eu/pricing/password-manager">1Password.eu</a>.</p>
<ul><li>If you choose to create a family or team account, only one person needs to set up an account. They’re responsible for inviting everyone else.</li><li>If someone already set up an account for your family or team, ask them to invite you. Then look for an invitation email from 1Password to join your family or team.</li></ul>
<p>During sign-up, you’ll be asked to create an account password. Use the password you already use with 1Password. You’ll also generate a Secret Key and receive a copy of your <a href="https://support.1password.com/emergency-kit/">Emergency Kit</a>, which you should <a href="https://support.1password.com/emergency-kit/#prepare-your-emergency-kit">fill out and save in a secure location</a>.</p>
<p>After you’re done creating your account, you’ll see your Home page.</p>
<p>The password you use to create your 1Password account is the one you will use to unlock 1Password after you migrate your data.</p>
<h2>Step 2: Migrate your data on your main device</h2>
<p>Pick one computer or mobile device that has all your 1Password data. You’ll add your account and migrate your data into it.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Set up your other devices</h2>
<p>After you’ve migrated your data on your main device, <a href="https://1password.com/downloads/">get 1Password 8</a> on your other devices.</p>
<p>You will not need to migrate your data again. If you see a prompt to migrate your data again, select <strong>Install without Moving Data</strong>, then select <strong>Install 1Password 8</strong>.</p>
<p>If you’re using a mobile device, you should also uninstall 1Password 7 on your <a href="https://support.1password.com/uninstall-1password/?ios">iOS</a> or <a href="https://support.1password.com/uninstall-1password/?android">Android</a> device after you upgrade to 1Password 8.</p>
