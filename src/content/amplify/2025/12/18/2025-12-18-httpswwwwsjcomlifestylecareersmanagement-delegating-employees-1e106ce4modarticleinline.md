<p>The mark of a good manager is the ability to delegate. Or so goes the conventional wisdom: By handing off tasks to direct reports, managers free themselves up for higher-level work, empower employees and increase the capacity of their teams.</p>
<p>But if delegation is supposed to be so great, why does it so often go wrong?</p>
<p>I’ve found that almost all managers fall into the same delegation trap: They treat delegation like an on-off switch. That is, after assigning a task to an employee, they immediately take a hands-off approach, hoping the employee gets it right and becoming frustrated when they don’t. Instead of empowering employees and reducing pressure on managers, delegation leads to frustration for both, as well as wasted effort and low motivation for team members.</p>
<p>An engineering manager at a large, high-tech company once said to me: “I would delegate if anyone figured out how to do things on their own. They don’t get it right, they take too long and they lack initiative.” Digging deeper, however, we discovered that her delegation problems had more to do with her than her team.</p>
<p>Instead of delegating and disappearing, I suggest a strategy that uses what I call a delegation dial.</p>
<h3 data-type="hed">Step by step</h3>
<p>The first step is to determine the employee’s degree of knowledge, skill and experience to handle the job or task you want to delegate. It’s obvious that an intern will need guidance, but that could be true of any team member, even a senior one, when it comes to specific projects. Note the type of questions the employee asks—do they indicate the person has an inkling of what you need them to do?</p>
<p>Once you’ve figured out where the employee stands, you can gauge how hands-on you need to be. My delegation dial—the level of input you need to provide—consists of five notches: “do,” “tell,” “teach,” “coach” and “safety net.”</p>
<p>“Do” means you have the employee observe you doing the job or task before you hand it off. This is most appropriate for team members who have never done the task before and don’t know where to begin. For employees who are capable of a bit more autonomy—for example, they understand which skills they lack and what they need to do to become proficient—there is “tell,” which means you provide step-by-step instructions on how to do a job, or “teach,” where you explain clearly why the job should be done in a particular order and manner and let the employee take it from there.</p>
<p>The next level, “coach” is when you let the employee handle the delegated task on their own, but coach them through it by asking questions such as: “What else did you consider?” or “What made you choose this option?” Finally, there is “safety net,” which is when you let your direct report do the job and tell them you are available if needed. Ironically, this is the step most managers start with.</p>
<h3 data-type="hed">Regular check-ins</h3>
<p>No matter which notch of the delegation dial you and your team member are operating in, schedule regular check-ins to avoid last-minute mismatches in expectations. The engineering manager I worked with scheduled biweekly check-ins, even when she was just acting as the person’s safety net.</p>
<p>Periodically reassess where employees are in their stage of learning to determine their readiness for increased autonomy. Ask them to evaluate what worked and how, and where they encountered stumbling blocks and why. What was their overall comfort level with the project? If there is any doubt about the employee’s increased capacity, it’s best to delegate at the current notch until the person proves themselves.</p>
<p>Using the delegation dial fulfills three goals: less work on our plates, growth for our teams, and higher quality work with fewer last-minute crises.</p>
