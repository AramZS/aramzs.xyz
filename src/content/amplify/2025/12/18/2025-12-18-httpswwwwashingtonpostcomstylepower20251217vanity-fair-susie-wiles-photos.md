<p>Every line, spot, blemish and blood vessel was captured by Christopher Anderson’s lens. What was he thinking?</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Vanity Fair <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/trump-susie-wiles-interview-exclusive-part-1">published</a> a two-part story by Chris Whipple about the inner circle of President Donald Trump’s staff featuring unusually candid conversations with Chief of Staff Susie Wiles. It also featured remarkably unvarnished portraits of Wiles, JD Vance, Marco Rubio and Karoline Leavitt, all photographed by Christopher Anderson.</p>
