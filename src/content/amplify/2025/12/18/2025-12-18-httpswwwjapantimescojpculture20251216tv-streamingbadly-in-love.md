<p><em>[Editor’s note: The following article includes spoilers for Netflix Japan’s “Badly in Love”]</em></p>
<p>First encounters on Japanese dating shows usually drip with polite discomfort. Strangers engineered together by ambitious programming exchange hellos, fumble through small talk and strain to find common ground — ideally something harmless enough to bond over.</p>
<p>This is not how “Badly in Love,” Netflix Japan’s newest reality-dating experiment, begins.</p>
<p>When the first two male contestants meet inside an empty high school, one immediately snarls, “What are you looking at?” The other snaps back. Desks start flying. They’re already nose to nose and barking insults before security barrels in to separate them.</p>
<p>This is just two minutes into the first episode.</p>
<p>“Badly in Love” gleefully flips the script on Japanese dating shows. The series, which premiered last week, follows self-identified delinquents tied to <em>yankī</em> culture — a subculture often associated with rebellion and run-ins with the law — as they attempt to find romance. From the jump, it signals a departure from Netflix’s usual aesthetic. Gone is the polished minimalism of “Terrace House.” In its place: clashing colors, dartboards, beer ads and a general vibe of controlled chaos. When couples want to get closer, they head to the sauna together, tattoos proudly on display.</p>

<p>Created by actor Megumi Yamano, “Badly in Love” aims to showcase “<a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/bady-in-love-premieres-december-9">people who are unapologetically themselves</a>” at a time when emotional restraint is the norm. The cast delivers. They speak bluntly about attraction, irritation and insecurity, skipping the sugarcoating common to the genre. Familiar reality-TV devices still appear — challenges, surprise arrivals, confessional interviews — but the participants’ rawness makes even the contrivances feel earned.</p>
<p>It’s also the rare reality show with strict rules. Despite the early fireworks, it quickly lays down rules: no physical violence, no illegal activity. Break them and you’re out. The threat isn’t theoretical. Contestants are reprimanded for throwing drinks and even for referencing past drug use. Still, nearly every episode finds someone pushing right up against those limits.</p>
<p>Much of the appeal comes from watching “Badly in Love” shove expectations into a locker. At times, it feels like Japan’s answer to MTV’s “Jersey Shore,” another series that centered a maligned subculture and dared viewers to look closer.</p>
<p>The difference is the gaze. “Jersey Shore” occasionally humanized its cast but still lingered on their excesses like a spectator sport. “Badly in Love” strips away distractions, isolating its participants in an attempt to get at something more sincere — and, surprisingly, it works.</p>
<p>More so than any previous Netflix dating show, “Badly in Love” functions as a collection of character studies. The contestants, with their turbulent pasts and all, reveal unexpected depth as they open up about trauma, regret and attempts to change course. They squabble, sure, but they also connect in ways that feel more lived-in than the streamer’s typical will-they-won’t-they fare. While the endgame is still a romantic confession, the group is also tasked with building a children’s cafeteria — a shared project everyone takes seriously.</p>
<p>The show’s biggest twist may be just how earnest it is. Emotions get messy, tempers flare, but “Badly in Love” has a refreshing directness missing from the increasingly convoluted dating formats Netflix Japan has churned out lately via “<a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/culture/2023/05/27/tv/love-village-dating/">Love Village</a>” and “<a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/culture/2025/02/18/tv-streaming/offline-love/">Offline Love</a>.” Everyone gets to the point — loudly, imperfectly — and the series is better for it.</p>
