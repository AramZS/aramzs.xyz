<p>CBS News pulled a planned “60 Minutes” segment on an El Salvador maximum-security prison where the Trump administration sent hundreds of Venezuelan migrants, a last-minute decision that drew a rebuke from one of its high-profile correspondents.</p>
<div>Sharyn Alfonsi said in a Sunday email to fellow correspondents including Lesley Stahl, Scott Pelley and Anderson Cooper that she learned Saturday that   <a data-type="link" href="https://www.wsj.com/business/media/paramount-buys-bari-weisss-the-free-press-for-150-million-737a94eb?mod=article_inline">new CBS News editor in chief</a> Bari Weiss “spiked our story.” Alfonsi said the last-minute change was, in her view, a political decision, rather than an editorial call, according to the email, which was reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. </div><p></p>
<p>“The 60 Minutes report on Inside CECOT will air in a future broadcast. We determined it needed additional reporting,” a spokesperson for CBS News said in a statement. Over the course of this weekend, Weiss made the decision not to run the piece as planned, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>“Our story was screened five times and cleared by both CBS attorneys and Standards and Practices. It is factually correct,” Alfonsi wrote in the email. If the standard for airing a story became the government agreeing to be interviewed, she wrote, the network would cede editorial control. “We go from an investigative powerhouse to a stenographer for the state,” Alfonsi wrote.</p>
<div>CBS parent   <a data-type="company" href="https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/PSKY">Paramount</a> <a href="https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/PSKY">PSKY 0.31% 🔼</a> purchased Weiss’s news and opinion site the Free Press   <a data-type="link" href="https://www.wsj.com/business/media/paramount-buys-bari-weisss-the-free-press-for-150-million-737a94eb?mod=article_inline">for $150 million</a> earlier this year. At the time of her appointment, David Ellison said he hired Weiss to bring to CBS “news that reflects reality” and journalism that “doesn’t seek to demonize, but seeks to understand.” </div><p></p>
<p>CBS advertised the segment on Friday, showcasing Alfonsi’s interviews with some of the deported migrants who had since been released from the megaprison, saying they described, “the brutal and torturous conditions they endured.”</p>
<div>The Trump administration earlier this year deported alleged Venezuelan gang members to El Salvador’s   <a data-type="link" href="https://www.wsj.com/world/americas/trump-sends-more-migrants-to-el-salvador-prison-a0431a07?mod=article_inline">Terrorism Confinement Center</a>, a sprawling compound known as Cecot.
