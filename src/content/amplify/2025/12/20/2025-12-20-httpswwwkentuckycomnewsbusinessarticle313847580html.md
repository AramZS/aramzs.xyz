title: Major Kentucky bourbon maker Jim Beam shuttering distillery for 2026
---
<p>One of Kentucky’s largest bourbon producers apparently is pausing whiskey production at the end of the year.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.beamdistilling.com/">Jim Beam</a>, which is one of the largest makers of American whiskey in the world, is planning to shut down production in Happy Hollow in Clermont on Jan. 1 through 2026.</p>
<p>The visitors center on site will remain open for Kentucky Bourbon Trail visitors.</p>
<p>“We are always assessing production levels to best meet consumer demand and recently met with our team to discuss our volumes for 2026,” according to a statement from the company. “We’ve shared with our teams that while we will continue to distill at our (Freddie Booker Noe) craft distillery in Clermont and at our larger Booker Noe distillery in Boston, we plan to pause distillation at our main distillery on the James B. Beam campus for 2026 while we take the opportunity to invest in site enhancements. Our visitor center at the James B. Beam campus remains open so visitors can have the full James B. Beam experience and join us for a meal at The Kitchen Table.”</p>
<p>Bottling and warehousing will still be operating at Clermont.</p>
<p>The news was first reported by <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/louisville/news/2025/12/19/jim-beam-production-pause-clermont-distillery-2026.html">Louisville Business Journal</a>.</p>
<h2>Kentucky bourbon industry troubles</h2>
<p>The move comes as Kentucky’s $9 billion bourbon industry grapples with a glut of whiskey and a slump in demand at home.</p>
<p>In response, the industry <a href="https://www.kentucky.com/lexgoeat/bourbon/article313593499.html">has pulled back production</a> by more than 55 million proof-gallons (an industry unit of measurement) or more than 28% through August, the lowest level since 2018.</p>
<p>At the same time, exports have been curtailed to major trading partners; Canada has been boycotting American spirits since March in retaliation for President Trump’s ongoing trade war and U.S. whiskey sales to that country are down by <a href="https://www.kentucky.com/lexgoeat/bourbon/article313389656.html">more than 60% through October</a>.</p>
<p>Other Kentucky companies including Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey maker Brown-Forman also have <a href="https://www.kentucky.com/news/business/article298507738.html">announced layoffs</a> or shorter pauses in production earlier in the year.</p>
<h2>Will there be layoffs at Jim Beam?</h2>
<p>So far, Beam has not filed a lay-offs notice with the state of Kentucky, according to the state’s WARN Act online database. It is unclear how many jobs might be impacted.</p>
<p>The Clermont distillery is a major production facility in Kentucky, making the flagship brand as well as Basil Hayden, Knob Creek and others. The company also operates a larger distillery in Boston, Ky.</p>
<p>Both are operated by <a href="https://www.suntoryglobalspirits.com/">Suntory Global Spirits</a>, whose Japanese parent company Suntory also owns <a href="https://www.makersmark.com/en-us/">Maker’s Mark</a>. Distilling at Maker’s Mark is not affected, according to a Suntory spokesperson.</p>
<p>As of 2024, Jim Beam had nearly 1,500 Kentucky employees, according to the company.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.suntoryglobalspirits.com/">Suntory</a>, which bought Jim Beam in 2014, says it has invested more than $540 million in its Kentucky facilities and that more than 100,000 people visit the James B. Beam Distilling Co. and Maker’s Mark every year.</p>
