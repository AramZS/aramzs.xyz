  you’re playing Tetris in a warzone, I guess?

<p>ModRetro, a company that makes <a href="https://kotaku.com/m64-mario-kart-modretro-palmer-luckey-nintendo-64-1851786895">retro handhelds and consoles that play older games</a> and that’s run by Oculus founder Palmer Luckey, has announced a new Chromatic device it’s making in collaboration with Luckey’s other professional endeavor: defense tech company Anduril Industries. The limited-edition handheld’s big selling point is that it’s made from the same metal Anduril uses to create its attack drones. Gross.</p>
<p>The $349.99 <a href="https://modretro.com/products/anduril-chromatic-porta-pro-bundle">Anduril Chromatic + Porta Pro Bundle</a> includes the handheld, headphones, and a charm of Anduril’s logo. The listing says that the device is made from the “same magnesium aluminum alloy as Anduril’s attack drones” and that if you’re looking for a retro gaming system that offers “performance and reliability under any and all conditions, there is no other option.” What kind of combat zone does ModRetro think people are playing <i>Tetris</i> in that they need something military-grade to play their games on?</p>
<p>While we can speculate about what kind of environment someone might play a retro handheld gaming system in, this is ultimately the latest effort from a glorified arms dealer responsible for making weapons used in acts of war to cozy up to the retro gaming community. The video game industry and the military-industrial complex have long been deeply connected in ways too numerous to count, joining forces to use <a href="https://kotaku.com/u-s-army-call-duty-twitch-ign-g4-swagg-stonemountain64-1849844389">games and live-streaming platforms to try to increase military recruitment</a> among Gen Z, but there is something particularly gross and fetishistic about selling people a Game Boy knock-off that is made to be as durable as an attack drone.</p>
<p>As you might expect, retro gamers and historians are not having it.</p>
<p>Luckey announced the ModRetro Chromatic <a href="https://kotaku.com/modretro-chromatic-game-boy-analogue-pocket-1851518764">back in 2024</a>, calling it the “world’s best tribute to the Game Boy,” but even then the entrepreneur’s retro hardware venture didn’t pass the smell test.. The Oculus co-founder was <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-did-facebook-fire-a-top-executive-hint-it-had-something-to-do-with-trump-1541965245">ousted from the VR company</a> some time after it was revealed he had helped fund pro-Donald Trump trolls, which <a href="https://kotaku.com/vr-developers-speak-out-about-oculus-founders-support-o-1787013760">led to some developers pulling Oculus support</a>. In the years since, Luckey founded Anduril, and then one thing led to another, and now, here we are, looking at a not-Game Boy made of drone metal.</p>
