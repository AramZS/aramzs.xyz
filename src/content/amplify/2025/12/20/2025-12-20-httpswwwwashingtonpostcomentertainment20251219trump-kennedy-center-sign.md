<p>The new signage follows a vote by the board of trustees to rename the arts complex the “Trump Kennedy Center,” a dramatic change for the presidential memorial.</p>
<p>The Kennedy Center installed President Donald Trump’s name on its exterior Friday morning, a dramatic change to a building established by law as a “living memorial” to a slain president.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the center’s board, made up of loyalists with Trump as chair, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/2025/12/18/kennedy-center-renamed-trump/">voted to rename</a> the institution “The Donald J. Trump and The John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts.”</p>
