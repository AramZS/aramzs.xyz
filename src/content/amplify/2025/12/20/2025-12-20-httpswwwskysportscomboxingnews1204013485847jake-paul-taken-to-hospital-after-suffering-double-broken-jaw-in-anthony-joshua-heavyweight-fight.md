<p>Jake Paul has confirmed his jaw was broken in two places during his defeat to Anthony Joshua in Miami.</p>
<p>The pair met in a heavyweight contest in the US city and the <a href="https://www.skysports.com/boxing/news/12183/13485767/anthony-joshua-knocks-out-jake-paul-in-the-sixth-round-of-their-fight-in-miami">British superstar knocked Paul to the canvas twice in the fifth and sixth rounds</a>, before the American failed to beat the count.</p>
<p>"Double broken jaw. Give me Canelo in 10 days," Paul wrote, above a screen shot of an X-ray showing the breaks.</p>

<p>Paul took to social media on Saturday to confirm he had undergone 'smooth' surgery on his jaw.</p>
<p>Paul did not face the media at the post-fight press conference as he sought treatment for the injury but Nikisa Bidarian, CEO of Paul's promoters Most Valuable Promotions, said: "He's fine. He drove himself to the hospital. A broken jaw's very common in sports, particularly in boxing or MMA.</p>
<p>"I think the recovery time from the doctors and surgeons we've already talked to is four to six weeks."</p>

<p>Paul barely landed a shot in the bout, which had been scheduled to go eight rounds at the Kaseya Center, but showed commendable heart to last as long as he did once Joshua's barrage began.</p>
<p>The 28-year-old YouTuber revealed he thought he had broken his jaw as he spat out a mouthful of blood during a post-fight interview.</p>
<p>"I'm feeling good, that was fun," he said. "I love this sport. I gave it my all... I had a blast.</p>

<p>"Anthony's a great fighter, I got my ass beat but that's what this sport's about.</p>
<p>"I think my jaw is broke by the way... it's definitely broke. A nice ass-whooping from one of the best to ever do it.</p>
<p>"We're going to heal the broken jaw, fight someone my weight and go for the cruiserweight world title.</p>
<p>"I'm going to take a little break. I've been going hard for six years."</p>
<p>Joshua was pleased to take the victory but expressed frustration that it took him until the end of the sixth round to get the finish.</p>
<p>The former world heavyweight champion also praised Paul for his durability.</p>

<p>"I wish I could've knocked him out in the start," said Joshua. "Jake has spirit, he has some heart. He tried his best.</p>
<p>"A lot of fighters haven't got in the ring with me, and Jake did. Even when he got knocked down, he kept on trying to get up. I take my hat off to him."</p>
<h3>What next for Jake Paul?</h3>
<p>Joshua's promoter Eddie Hearn praised Paul for the way he got up following the punch which finished the fight, but expressed his reservations over how difficult a broken jaw can be for a boxer to properly recover from.</p>
<p>"Those injuries are very difficult to come back from but as AJ said, that last shot would have knocked out a lot of heavyweights," said Hearn.</p>
<figure><figcaption data-testid="article-image-caption"> Image: Joshua lands a big punch on Paul during their heavyweight bout  </figcaption></figure>
<p>"It was a very one-sided fight, it was always going to be a one-sided fight, but you can't give him anything but credit and respect. He just went in with Anthony Joshua and gave it his best shot, took a lot of punishment, and ended the fight, eventually, on his feet after the stoppage.</p>
<p>"I think he'll have to see physically, how that jaw - I don't know the severity of it, it's a very difficult injury to come back from - but he showed he's got ability, and that's what we said. He's dedicated to the game."</p>
<p>Joshua, though, believes that Paul has the desire and ability to come back from the knockout - despite not quite considering him to be in the top echelon of fighters.</p>
<p>"Jake Paul has been boxing now for five-or-so years at an elite level, the amount of pressure that's been put on his shoulders, and he's lived up to that pressure," said Joshua.</p>

<p>"America, I think you have someone who could, potentially - if he still has the heart for it - come back again, dust the dirt off his shoulder, and come again and maybe sell out this Center sometime in 2026 maybe against Gervonta Davis, Ryan Garcia, who knows?</p>
<p>"I'm not going to say 'world class' because in our modern day era, there's maybe four, five, six, seven, Anthony Joshuas that can punch, that can avoid punches, that know what they're doing in the ring.</p>
<p>"Jake will struggle at top level, but he has a place in boxing if he wants to stay, in my opinion, so credit to him and his team for getting him this far."</p>
