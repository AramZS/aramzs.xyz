<p>A fairly common discussion in journalism/adjacent circles on social media is:</p>
<blockquote><strong>Media critic:</strong> With all of the disinformation and misinformation online, the news industry needs to figure out how to better reach its communities.<br/><strong>Education advocate:</strong> What we really need is to teach high school students to be more discerning consumers of information.</blockquote>
<p>No journalist would dispute the value of critical thinking and media literacy. But the claim struck me today as similar to Big Tech's endless assertions:</p>
<blockquote>GenAI is inevitable; resistance is futile.</blockquote>
<p>Yes, our own claims are rhetorical (not technological) determinism. But the logic is the same: we know what is best for our communities, and “best” reliably aligns with our existing professional practices, interests, and profit motives. By doing so, we try to reframe long-term economic and cultural changes as questions of individual behavior. "Things would be better <em>if only</em> readers would act correctly."</p>
<ul><li>Journalism is expensive to create, and readers should have to pay for it.</li><li>Journalism is valuable; people should read past the headline.</li><li>Readers should know the difference between news and opinion.</li><li>Readers should seek news from the original source, not social media.</li></ul>
<p>See the pattern? The claims aren’t <em>always</em> wrong so much as unmoored. Without a theory of change that assigns a shared responsibility to journalism itself, they are condescending platitudes.</p>
<p>If empty wishes were dollars, the business model problem would be solved.</p>
