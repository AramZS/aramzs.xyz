title: 'In 2026, AI will outwrite humans'

<p>“It’s a story about volume, value, and what journalism becomes when “content” grows functionally infinite.”</p>
<p>In 2026, AI-written content will outpace what humans produce — not just in spammy corners of the web, but across the mainstream channels where people search, scroll, and learn. This isn’t a story about technological capability. We already know machines can generate limitless words. It’s a story about volume, value, and what journalism becomes when “content” grows functionally infinite.</p>
<p>Publishers have spent years worrying about shrinking attention spans. In 2026, the bigger problem will be attention spread thin across an overwhelming surplus of AI-generated media. AI may guzzle water, electricity, and money at industrial scale, yet it still costs users virtually nothing to produce endless content; companies are subsidizing that output to build habits and lock in dominance before the bills come due. As those incentives play out, our feeds are already being reshaped — human work increasingly receding as a tide of machine-generated content rises. And as AI begins training on its own output, distortions will only compound, creating an internet that feels more synthetic by the day.</p>
<p>You can already see the consequences. Google’s move toward AI-powered search has upended its once-delicate relationship with online publishers, where if businesses create good content, Google sends them traffic — from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-07/google-ai-search-shift-leaves-website-makers-feeling-betrayed?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2NDgwMjc0OCwiZXhwIjoxNzY1NDA3NTQ4LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTVFVFQkpEV1gyUFMwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJFNzAxNENGQzIzNTI0MzU0QTVENUY2QkREMDAxOEU3NiJ9._nI2CyOnz1A8IAdO2ZYz-UVdum4p74uzbGck-DJ0lTI">small site owners blindsided by the shift</a>, to others who <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-15/google-s-search-dominance-leaves-sites-little-choice-on-ai-scraping?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2NDgwMjc5NCwiZXhwIjoxNzY1NDA3NTk0LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTSTlHNEREV0xVNjgwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJFNzAxNENGQzIzNTI0MzU0QTVENUY2QkREMDAxOEU3NiJ9.H2Ch_pFNtdFuFeHkc6iT19Fj2kAMn_Mm-DflgSHqKOc">feel forced to share data</a> simply to stay visible, even as <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-19/google-gave-sites-little-choice-in-using-data-for-ai-search?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2NDgwMjgzNiwiZXhwIjoxNzY1NDA3NjM2LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTV0lYRjRUMEcxS1kwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJFNzAxNENGQzIzNTI0MzU0QTVENUY2QkREMDAxOEU3NiJ9.O0v0pWV3woMJuNP4mXpmvyUMyV7LOxdjrRE84xT3fx4">Google offers publishers limited choice</a> in how their work is used in AI search. This isn’t just a Google story, either. Content grounded in lived experience, tested knowledge, and the responsibility of real-world work is <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-25/ai-slop-recipes-are-taking-over-the-internet-and-thanksgiving-dinner?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2NDgwMjg4MSwiZXhwIjoxNzY1NDA3NjgxLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUNkFGNzVLR1pBSlowMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJFNzAxNENGQzIzNTI0MzU0QTVENUY2QkREMDAxOEU3NiJ9.VF4QmYZmp_TyZ70RLN-k_DnuL-zxXIQpqCXRrp_P2G8">being buried under an AI flood</a> across Facebook, Pinterest, and beyond.</p>
<p>Platforms say they value accuracy and depth. Often, they do — in principle. But when algorithms are tuned to optimize for attention above all else, even well-intentioned systems end up favoring content that’s fast, sticky, or politically convenient rather than well-reported. Add in the way enforcement quietly shifts depending on who holds power, and you get an ecosystem where truth must fight harder than ever against noise just to be seen.</p>
<p>So, yes, the human-written word will become scarcer online. But scarcity alone won’t save news. What is scarce only has value if people can recognize it, and believe it’s worth seeking out. The threat ahead isn’t merely that AI will outwrite us. It’s that the flood of machine-made text will flatten everything unless news organizations and independent creators can articulate — and demonstrate — the worth of human reporting.</p>
<p>At its core, journalism is a promise that someone actually went out into the world and checked. A person witnessed, verified, contextualized. They asked questions. They faced an editor and a critical audience. Reporting, attribution, accountability, discernment — these are human tasks, and they only grow more valuable as the web fills with indistinguishable machine-made filler.</p>
<p>This year alone, my colleagues and I reviewed more than 2,000 YouTube videos to map how the country’s most influential podcasters <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2025-youtube-podcast-men-for-trump/?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2NDgwMjkyMiwiZXhwIjoxNzY1NDA3NzIyLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTUUhRVDFUMEcxS1cwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJFNzAxNENGQzIzNTI0MzU0QTVENUY2QkREMDAxOEU3NiJ9.69jOEaioKk-MPJaRjtXxdcAzY3nbZUA2DcFVIyt2Jhw">pushed millions of young men to the political right</a>, and analyzed nearly 1,000 episodes and 188 advertisers to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2025-conservative-youtube-stars-marketing-boom/?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2NDgwMjk0NSwiZXhwIjoxNzY1NDA3NzQ1LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUNjBSVDVHUTdLWlcwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJFNzAxNENGQzIzNTI0MzU0QTVENUY2QkREMDAxOEU3NiJ9.PptCLpOBxXeJaFZ-eKa3ZWpRTpSnY-h7sRhAnZPG8Ak">show how major political podcasts monetized identity</a>. AI could summarize our findings after the fact. But it couldn’t ask the right questions, collect the data, or confront the sources.</p>
<p>Journalism’s value has never been in the quantity of our output, but in the rigor behind it. Machines can predict, remix, and regenerate. Only humans can report. Journalism can thrive if it demonstrates, story by story, what a machine cannot: the courage to look directly at the world, the judgment to interpret it, and the willingness to stand behind every word. That is a value worth defending, because no algorithm can recreate it, and no amount of automated text can replace it.</p>
