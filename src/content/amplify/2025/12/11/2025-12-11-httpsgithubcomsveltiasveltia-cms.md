<h1>Sveltia CMS</h1>
<p>Sveltia CMS is a Git-based lightweight headless CMS under active development as a modern, quick replacement for Netlify CMS and Decap CMS. In some simple cases, migration is as easy as a single line of code change, although we are still working on improving compatibility. The free, open source, UX-focused alternative to Netlify/Decap CMS is now in public beta — with more features to come.</p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>Sveltia CMS was born in November 2022, when the progress of Netlify CMS was stalled for more than six months. <a href="https://github.com/kyoshino">@kyoshino</a>’s clients wanted to replace their Netlify CMS instances without much effort, mainly to get better internationalization (i18n) support.</p>
<p>To achieve radical improvements in UX, performance, i18n and other areas, it was decided to build an alternative from the ground up, while ensuring an easy migration path from the other. After proving the concept with a rapid <a href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a> prototype, development was accelerated to address their primary use cases. The new product has since been named Sveltia CMS and released as open source software to encourage wider adoption.</p>
<h3>Our advantage</h3>
<p>Due to its unfortunate abandonment, Netlify CMS spawned 3 successors:</p>
<ul> <li><a href="https://github.com/StaticJsCMS/static-cms">Static CMS</a>: a community maintenance fork, first appeared on GitHub in September 2022</li> <li><strong>Sveltia CMS</strong>: a total reboot, started in November 2022, first appeared on GitHub in March 2023</li> <li><a href="https://github.com/decaporg/decap-cms">Decap CMS</a>: a rebranded version, owned by a Netlify agency partner, <a href="https://www.netlify.com/blog/netlify-cms-to-become-decap-cms/">announced in February 2023</a> as the official successor</li> </ul>
<p>Sveltia CMS is the only project that doesn’t inherit the complexity, technical debt and miscellaneous bugs of Netlify CMS, which was launched back in 2016. We are confident that our decision to rebuild the application from scratch was the right one, as proven by the hundreds of improvements we have already made.</p>
<p>While Sveltia CMS is specifically designed to replace legacy Netlify CMS instances, it also aims to serve as a substitute for the other products. (Note: Static CMS compatibility will be worked on after the Sveltia CMS 1.0 release)</p>
<h3>Our goals</h3>
<ul> <li>Making Sveltia CMS a viable, definitive successor to Netlify CMS</li> <li>Emerging as the leading open source offering in the Git-based CMS market</li> <li>Empowering small businesses and individuals who need a simple, free, yet powerful CMS solution</li> <li>Extending its capabilities as digital asset management (DAM) software</li> <li>Showcasing the vast potential of the Svelte framework</li> </ul>
<h2>Development status</h2>
<p>Sveltia CMS is <strong>still in beta</strong>, so please be careful when trying it out.</p>
<p>While we fix reported bugs as quickly as possible, usually within 24 hours, our overall progress may be slower than you think. The thing is, it’s not just a personal project of <a href="https://github.com/kyoshino">@kyoshino</a>, but also involves different kinds of activities:</p>
<ul> <li>Ensuring maximum <a href="https://github.com/sveltia/sveltia-cms#compatibility">compatibility with existing versions of Netlify/Decap CMS</a></li> <li>Tackling as many <a href="https://github.com/decaporg/decap-cms/issues">issues reported to Netlify/Decap CMS</a> as possible <ul> <li>So far, 115+ of them (or 190+ including duplicates) have been effectively solved in Sveltia CMS</li> <li>Target: 125 issues by GA, 250 in a future release</li> <li><a href="https://github.com/sveltia/sveltia-cms/issues/new">Let us know</a> if you have any specific issues you’d like to see solved!</li> </ul> </li> <li>Responding to feedback from clients and regular users</li> <li>Implementing our own UX enhancement ideas</li> <li>Upgrading to <a href="https://svelte.dev/blog/svelte-5-release-candidate">Svelte 5</a> for unparalleled performance</li> </ul>
<p>Sveltia CMS <strong>version 1.0 is expected to ship by the end of 2024</strong>. Check our <a href="https://github.com/sveltia/sveltia-cms/releases">release notes</a> for updates. See also our <a href="https://github.com/sveltia/sveltia-cms#roadmap">roadmap</a>.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<p>We are working hard to create a <strong>significantly better alternative to Netlify CMS and Decap CMS</strong> by improving everything. Here’s what makes Sveltia CMS different. Look how serious we are!</p>
<h3>Compatible with Netlify/Decap CMS</h3>
<ul> <li>Ready to be used as a drop-in replacement for Netlify/Decap CMS <em>in some casual use case scenarios</em> with a single line of code update.</li> <li>Your existing <a href="https://decapcms.org/docs/configuration-options/">configuration file</a> can be reused as is.</li> <li>However, some features are still missing or will not be added, most notably Git Gateway and Netlify Identity. Look at the <a href="https://github.com/sveltia/sveltia-cms#compatibility">compatibility info</a> below to see if you can migrate now or soon.</li> </ul>
<h3>Better UX</h3>
<ul> <li>Created and maintained by an <a href="https://github.com/kyoshino">experienced UX engineer</a> who loves code, design and marketing. You can expect constant improvements to the user experience (UX) and developer experience (DX) across the platform.</li> <li>Offers a modern, intuitive user interface, including an immersive dark mode<sup><a data-footnote-ref="" href="https://github.com/sveltia/sveltia-cms#user-content-fn-2-d226868c4d739dc87d49b32d4a223d83">1</a></sup>, inspired in part by the Netlify CMS v3 prototype<sup><a data-footnote-ref="" href="https://github.com/sveltia/sveltia-cms#user-content-fn-1-d226868c4d739dc87d49b32d4a223d83">2</a></sup>.</li> <li>Comes with touch device support. While the UI is not yet optimized for small screens, large tablets like iPad Pro or Pixel Tablet should work well. Mobile support is planned after the 1.0 release.</li> <li>Made with Svelte, not React, means we can spend more time on UX rather than tedious state management. It also allows us to avoid common fatal application crashes<sup><a data-footnote-ref="" href="https://github.com/sveltia/sveltia-cms#user-content-fn-113-d226868c4d739dc87d49b32d4a223d83">3</a></sup>. Best of all, Svelte offers great performance!</li> <li>The screenshots above are worth a thousand words, but read on to learn about many other improvements in detail.</li> </ul>
<h3>Better performance</h3>
<ul> <li>Built completely from scratch with Svelte instead of forking React-based Netlify/Decap CMS. The app starts fast and stays fast. The compiled code is vanilla JavaScript — you can use it with any framework that can load static data files while building your website or application.</li> <li>Small footprint: The bundle size is less than 550 KB when minified and gzipped, which is much lighter than Netlify CMS (1.5 MB), Decap CMS (1.8 MB) and Static CMS (2.6 MB), even though we haven’t implemented some features yet<sup><a data-footnote-ref="" href="https://github.com/sveltia/sveltia-cms#user-content-fn-57-d226868c4d739dc87d49b32d4a223d83">4</a></sup><sup><a data-footnote-ref="" href="https://github.com/sveltia/sveltia-cms#user-content-fn-64-d226868c4d739dc87d49b32d4a223d83">5</a></sup>.</li> <li>The ongoing <a href="https://svelte.dev/blog/svelte-5-release-candidate">Svelte 5</a> upgrade is anticipated to deliver further performance improvements, including accelerated speed and even smaller bundle size (an estimated 100 KB reduction).</li> <li>Sveltia CMS is free of technical debt and <a href="https://svelte.dev/blog/virtual-dom-is-pure-overhead">virtual DOM overhead</a>.</li> <li>Uses the GraphQL API for GitHub and GitLab to quickly fetch content at once, so that entries and assets can be listed and searched instantly<sup><a data-footnote-ref="" href="https://github.com/sveltia/sveltia-cms#user-content-fn-32-d226868c4d739dc87d49b32d4a223d83">6</a></sup><sup><a data-footnote-ref="" href="https://github.com/sveltia/sveltia-cms#user-content-fn-65-d226868c4d739dc87d49b32d4a223d83">7</a></sup>. It also avoids the slowness and potential API rate limit violations caused by hundreds of requests with Relation widgets<sup><a data-footnote-ref="" href="https://github.com/sveltia/sveltia-cms#user-content-fn-14-d226868c4d739dc87d49b32d4a223d83">8</a></sup>.</li> <li>Saving entries and assets to GitHub is also much faster thanks to the <a href="https://github.blog/changelog/2021-09-13-a-simpler-api-for-authoring-commits/">GraphQL mutation</a>.</li> <li>Using caching and lazy loading techniques. A list of repository files is stored locally for faster startup and bandwidth savings.</li> <li>Thumbnails of assets, including videos and PDF files, are generated and cached for faster rendering of the Asset Library and other parts of the CMS<sup><a data-footnote-ref="" href="https://github.com/sveltia/sveltia-cms#user-content-fn-39-d226868c4d739dc87d49b32d4a223d83">9</a></sup>.</li> <li>No typing lag on input widgets, especially within nested lists and objects<sup><a data-footnote-ref="" href="https://github.com/sveltia/sveltia-cms#user-content-fn-77-d226868c4d739dc87d49b32d4a223d83">10</a></sup>.</li> </ul>
<h3>Better productivity</h3>
<ul> <li>You can <a href="https://github.com/sveltia/sveltia-cms#working-with-a-local-git-repository">work with a local Git repository</a> without any extra configuration or proxy server<sup><a data-footnote-ref="" href="https://github.com/sveltia/sveltia-cms#user-content-fn-26-d226868c4d739dc87d49b32d4a223d83">11</a></sup>. <ul> <li>In addition to a streamlined workflow, it offers great performance by reading and writing files natively through the browser rather than using a slow, ad hoc REST API.</li> <li>It also avoids a number of issues, including the 30 MB file size limit<sup><a data-footnote-ref="" href="https://github.com/sveltia/sveltia-cms#user-content-fn-51-d226868c4d739dc87d49b32d4a223d83">12</a></sup>, an unknown error with <code>publish_mode</code><sup><a data-footnote-ref="" href="https://github.com/sveltia/sveltia-cms#user-content-fn-75-d226868c4d739dc87d49b32d4a223d83">13</a></sup>, and an unused <code>logo_url</code><sup><a data-footnote-ref="" href="https://github.com/sveltia/sveltia-cms#user-content-fn-49-d226868c4d739dc87d49b32d4a223d83">14</a></sup>.</li> <li>When you delete an entry or an asset file, the empty folder that contains it is also deleted, so you don’t have to delete it manually.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Provides a smoother user experience in the Content Editor: <ul> <li>A local backup of an entry draft is automatically created without interruption by a confirmation dialog, which annoys users and can cause a page navigation problem if dismissed<sup><a data-footnote-ref="" href="https://github.com/sveltia/sveltia-cms#user-content-fn-106-d226868c4d739dc87d49b32d4a223d83">15</a></sup>. The backup can then be reliably restored without unexpected overwriting<sup><a data-footnote-ref="" href="https://github.com/sveltia/sveltia-cms#user-content-fn-85-d226868c4d739dc87d49b32d4a223d83">16</a></sup>.</li> <li>Click once (the Save button) instead of twice (Publish &gt; Publish now) to save an entry.</li> <li>The editor closes automatically when an entry is saved. This behaviour can be changed in Settings.</li> </ul> </li> <li>You can upload multiple assets at once<sup><a data-footnote-ref="" href="https://github.com/sveltia/sveltia-cms#user-content-fn-5-d226868c4d739dc87d49b32d4a223d83">17</a></sup>.</li> <li>You can delete multiple entries and assets at once.</li> <li>Some <a href="https://github.com/sveltia/sveltia-cms#using-keyboard-shortcuts">keyboard shortcuts</a> are available for faster editing.</li> <li>Never miss out on the latest features and bug fixes by being notified when an update to the CMS is available<sup><a data-footnote-ref="" href="https://github.com/sveltia/sveltia-cms#user-content-fn-31-d226868c4d739dc87d49b32d4a223d83">18</a></sup>. Then update to the latest version with a single click<sup><a data-footnote-ref="" href="https://github.com/sveltia/sveltia-cms#user-content-fn-66-d226868c4d739dc87d49b32d4a223d83">19</a></sup>.</li> </ul>
<h3>Better accessibility</h3>
<ul> <li>Improved keyboard handling lets you efficiently navigate through UI elements using the Tab, Space, Enter and arrow keys<sup><a data-footnote-ref="" href="https://github.com/sveltia/sveltia-cms#user-content-fn-17-d226868c4d739dc87d49b32d4a223d83">20</a></sup><sup><a data-footnote-ref="" href="https://github.com/sveltia/sveltia-cms#user-content-fn-67-d226868c4d739dc87d49b32d4a223d83">21</a></sup>.</li> <li>Comprehensive <a href="https://w3c.github.io/aria/">WAI-ARIA</a> support enables users who rely on screen readers such as NVDA and VoiceOver.</li> <li>The rich text editor is built with <a href="https://lexical.dev/">Lexical</a>, which is said to follow accessibility best practices. The <a href="https://lexical.dev/docs/packages/lexical-dragon">Dragon NaturallySpeaking support</a> is enabled.</li> <li>Ensures sufficient contrast between the foreground text and background colours.</li> <li>Enabled and disabled buttons can be clearly distinguished<sup><a data-footnote-ref="" href="https://github.com/sveltia/sveltia-cms#user-content-fn-105-d226868c4d739dc87d49b32d4a223d83">22</a></sup>.</li> <li>Links are underlined by default to make them easier to recognize. This behaviour can be changed in the Accessibility Settings if you prefer.</li> <li>Honours your operating system’s <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-reduced-motion">reduced motion</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-reduced-transparency">reduced transparency</a> settings. (Support for <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-contrast">high contrast mode</a> will be added later.)</li> <li>Browser console logs for developers are readable in either light or dark mode<sup><a data-footnote-ref="" href="https://github.com/sveltia/sveltia-cms#user-content-fn-116-d226868c4d739dc87d49b32d4a223d83">23</a></sup>.</li> <li>We’ll continue to test and improve the application to meet <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/guidelines/22/">WCAG 2.2</a>.</li> </ul>
<h3>Better security</h3>
<ul> <li>Avoids high/critical severity vulnerabilities through constant dependency updates, <a href="https://pnpm.io/cli/audit"><code>pnpm audit</code></a>, and frequent releases<sup><a data-footnote-ref="" href="https://github.com/sveltia/sveltia-cms#user-content-fn-33-d226868c4d739dc87d49b32d4a223d83">24</a></sup>.</li> <li>We have documented how to <a href="https://github.com/sveltia/sveltia-cms#setting-up-content-security-policy">set up a Content Security Policy</a> for the CMS to prevent any unexpected errors or otherwise insecure configuration<sup><a data-footnote-ref="" href="https://github.com/sveltia/sveltia-cms#user-content-fn-108-d226868c4d739dc87d49b32d4a223d83">25</a></sup>.</li> <li>The <code>unsafe-eval</code> and <code>unsafe-inline</code> keywords are not needed in the <code>script-src</code> CSP directive<sup><a data-footnote-ref="" href="https://github.com/sveltia/sveltia-cms#user-content-fn-34-d226868c4d739dc87d49b32d4a223d83">26</a></sup>.</li> <li>The <code>same-origin</code> referrer policy is automatically set with a <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> tag.</li> </ul>
<h3>Better configuration</h3>
<ul> <li>Some servers and frameworks remove the trailing slash from the CMS URL (<code>/admin</code>) depending on the configuration. In such cases, the config file is loaded from a root-relative URL (<code>/admin/config.yml</code>) instead of a regular relative URL (<code>./config.yml</code> = <code>/config.yml</code>) that results in a 404 Not Found error<sup><a data-footnote-ref="" href="https://github.com/sveltia/sveltia-cms#user-content-fn-107-d226868c4d739dc87d49b32d4a223d83">27</a></sup>.</li> <li>Supports a <a href="https://github.com/sveltia/sveltia-cms#providing-a-json-configuration-file">JSON configuration file</a> that can be generated for bulk or complex collections<sup><a data-footnote-ref="" href="https://github.com/sveltia/sveltia-cms#user-content-fn-60-d226868c4d739dc87d49b32d4a223d83">28</a></sup>.</li> <li>The application renders within the dimensions of a <a href="https://decapcms.org/docs/custom-mounting/">custom mount element</a>, if exists<sup><a data-footnote-ref="" href="https://github.com/sveltia/sveltia-cms#user-content-fn-109-d226868c4d739dc87d49b32d4a223d83">29</a></sup>.</li> </ul>
<h3>Better backend support</h3>
<ul> <li>Uses the GraphQL API where possible for better performance, as mentioned above. You don’t need to set the <code>use_graphql</code> option to enable it for GitHub and GitLab.</li> <li>The Git branch name is automatically set to the repository’s default branch (<code>main</code>, <code>master</code> or whatever) if not specified in the configuration file, preventing data loading errors due to a hardcoded fallback to <code>master</code><sup><a data-footnote-ref="" href="https://github.com/sveltia/sveltia-cms#user-content-fn-95-d226868c4d739dc87d49b32d4a223d83">30</a></sup><sup><a data-footnote-ref="" href="https://github.com/sveltia/sveltia-cms#user-content-fn-27-d226868c4d739dc87d49b32d4a223d83">31</a></sup>.</li> <li>You can <a href="https://github.com/sveltia/sveltia-cms#disabling-automatic-deployments">disable automatic deployments</a> by default or on demand to save costs and resources associated with CI/CD and to publish multiple changes at once<sup><a data-footnote-ref="" href="https://github.com/sveltia/sveltia-cms#user-content-fn-24-d226868c4d739dc87d49b32d4a223d83">32</a></sup>.</li> <li>The GitLab backend support comes with background <a href="https://status.gitlab.com/">service status</a> checking, just like GitHub.</li> <li>Service status checks are performed frequently and an incident notification is displayed prominently.</li> <li>You can quickly open the source file of an entry or asset in your repository using View on GitHub (or GitLab) under the 3-dot menu.</li> <li>You won’t get a 404 Not Found error when you sign in to the GitLab backend<sup><a data-footnote-ref="" href="https://github.com/sveltia/sveltia-cms#user-content-fn-115-d226868c4d739dc87d49b32d4a223d83">33</a></sup>.</li> <li>Features the all-new local backend that boosts DX. See the <a href="https://github.com/sveltia/sveltia-cms#better-productivity">productivity section</a> above.</li> <li>You can select the local and remote backends while working on a local server.</li> </ul>
<h3>Better i18n support</h3>
<p>Sveltia CMS has been built with a multilingual architecture from the very beginning. You can expect first-class internationalization (i18n) support, as it’s required by clients of maintainer <a href="https://github.com/kyoshino">@kyoshino</a>, who himself was a long-time Japanese localizer for Mozilla and currently lives in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto">city</a> where 150+ languages are spoken.</p>

<h2>Getting started</h2>
<h3>New users</h3>
<p>Currently, Sveltia CMS is primarily intended for existing Netlify/Decap CMS users. If you don’t have it yet, follow <a href="https://decapcms.org/docs/basic-steps/">their documentation</a> to add it to your site and create a configuration file first. Then migrate to Sveltia CMS as described below.</p>
<p>As the product evolves, we’ll implement a built-in configuration editor and provide comprehensive documentation to make it easier for everyone to get started with Sveltia CMS.</p>
<p>Here are some starter kits for popular frameworks created by community members. More to follow!</p>
<ul> <li><a href="https://github.com/danurbanowicz/eleventy-sveltia-cms-starter">Eleventy starter template</a> by <a href="https://github.com/danurbanowicz">@danurbanowicz</a></li> <li><a href="https://github.com/privatemaker/headless-cms">Hugo module</a> by <a href="https://github.com/privatemaker">@privatemaker</a></li> <li><a href="https://github.com/Hugolify/hugolify-sveltia-cms/">hugolify-sveltia-cms</a> by <a href="https://github.com/sebousan">@sebousan</a></li> <li>Astro: <a href="https://github.com/majesticostudio/astro-sveltia-cms">astro-sveltia-cms</a>, <a href="https://github.com/zankhq/astro-starter">astro-starter</a> and <a href="https://github.com/zankhq/astros">astros</a> by <a href="https://github.com/zanhk">@zanhk</a></li> </ul>
<p>Alternatively, you can probably use one of the <a href="https://decapcms.org/docs/start-with-a-template/">Netlify/Decap CMS templates</a> and make a quick migration to Sveltia CMS.</p>
<h3>Migration</h3>
<p>Have a look at the <a href="https://github.com/sveltia/sveltia-cms#compatibility">compatibility info</a> above first. If you’re already using Netlify/Decap CMS with the GitHub or GitLab backend and don’t have any custom widget, custom preview or plugin, migrating to Sveltia CMS is super easy — it works as a drop-in replacement. Edit <code>/admin/index.html</code> to replace the CMS <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag, and push the change to your repository. Your new <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag is:</p>
<pre>&lt;script src="https://unpkg.com/@sveltia/cms/dist/sveltia-cms.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</pre>
<p>From Netlify CMS:</p>
<pre>-&lt;script src="https://unpkg.com/netlify-cms@^2.0.0/dist/netlify-cms.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
+&lt;script src="https://unpkg.com/@sveltia/cms/dist/sveltia-cms.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</pre>
<p>From Decap CMS:</p>
<pre>-&lt;script src="https://unpkg.com/decap-cms@^3.0.0/dist/decap-cms.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
+&lt;script src="https://unpkg.com/@sveltia/cms/dist/sveltia-cms.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</pre>
<p>That’s it! You can open <code>https://[hostname]/admin/</code> as before to start editing. There is even no authentication process if you’ve already been signed in with GitHub or GitLab on Netlify/Decap CMS because Sveltia CMS uses your auth token stored in the browser. Simple enough!</p>
<p>That said, we strongly recommend testing your new Sveltia CMS instance first on your local machine. <a href="https://github.com/sveltia/sveltia-cms#working-with-a-local-git-repository">See below</a> for how.</p>
<h3>Installing with npm</h3>
<p>For advanced users, we have also made the bundle available as an <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sveltia/cms">npm package</a>. You can install it by running <code>npm i @sveltia/cms</code> or <code>pnpm add @sveltia/cms</code> on your project. The <a href="https://decapcms.org/docs/manual-initialization/">manual initialization</a> flow with the <code>init</code> method is the same as for Netlify/Decap CMS.</p>
<h3>Updates</h3>
<p>Updating Sveltia CMS is transparent, unless you include a specific version in the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> source URL or use the npm package. Whenever you (re)load the CMS, the latest version will be served via <a href="https://unpkg.com/">UNPKG</a>. The CMS also periodically checks for updates and notifies you when a new version is available. After the product reaches GA, you could use a semantic version range (<code>^1.0.0</code>) like Netlify/Decap CMS.</p>
<p>If you’ve chosen to install with npm, updating the package is your responsibility. We recommend using <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-check-updates"><code>ncu</code></a> or a service like <a href="https://github.blog/2020-06-01-keep-all-your-packages-up-to-date-with-dependabot/">Dependabot</a> to keep dependencies up to date, otherwise you’ll miss important bug fixes and new features.</p>
<h2>Tips &amp; tricks</h2>
<h3>Providing a JSON configuration file</h3>
<p>Sveltia CMS supports a configuration file written in the JSON format in addition to the standard YAML format. This allows developers to programmatically generate the CMS configuration to enable bulk or complex collections. To do this, simply add a <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tag to your HTML, just like a <a href="https://decapcms.org/docs/configuration-options/#configuration-file">custom YAML config link</a>, but with the type <code>application/json</code>:</p>
<pre>&lt;link href="path/to/config.json" type="application/json" rel="cms-config-url" /&gt;</pre>
<p>Alternatively, you can <a href="https://decapcms.org/docs/manual-initialization/">manually initialize</a> the CMS with a JavaScript configuration object.</p>
<h3>Migrating from Git Gateway backend</h3>
<p>Sveltia CMS does not support the Git Gateway backend due to performance limitations. If you don’t care about user management with Netlify Identity, you can use the <a href="https://decapcms.org/docs/github-backend/">GitHub backend</a> or <a href="https://decapcms.org/docs/gitlab-backend/">GitLab backend</a> instead. Make sure <strong>you install an OAuth client</strong> on GitHub or GitLab in addition to updating your configuration file. As noted in the document, Netlify is still able to facilitate the auth flow.</p>
<h3>Moving your site from Netlify to another hosting service</h3>
<p>You can host your Sveltia CMS-managed site anywhere, such as <a href="https://pages.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare Pages</a> or <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>. But moving away from Netlify means you can no longer sign in with GitHub or GitLab via Netlify. Instead, you can use <a href="https://github.com/sveltia/sveltia-cms-auth">our own OAuth client</a>, which can be easily deployed to Cloudflare Workers, or <a href="https://decapcms.org/docs/external-oauth-clients/">any other 3rd party client</a> made for Netlify/Decap CMS.</p>
<h3>Working around authentication error</h3>
<p>If you get an “Authentication Aborted” error when trying to sign in to GitHub or GitLab using the authorization code flow, you may need to check your site’s <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy"><code>Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy</code></a>. The COOP header is not widely used, but it’s known to break the OAuth flow with a popup window. If that’s your case, changing <code>same-origin</code> to <code>same-origin-allow-popups</code> solves the problem. (<a data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/sveltia/sveltia-cms/issues/131/hovercard" href="https://github.com/sveltia/sveltia-cms/issues/131">Discussion</a>)</p>
<h3>Working with a local Git repository</h3>
<p>You can use Sveltia CMS with a local Git repository like Netlify/Decap CMS, but Sveltia CMS has simplified the workflow by removing the need for additional configuration (the <code>local_backend</code> property) and a proxy server, thanks to the <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/articles/file-system-access/">File System Access API</a> available in <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/web/api/window/showopenfilepicker#browser_compatibility">some modern browsers</a>.</p>
<ol> <li>Make sure you have configured the <a href="https://decapcms.org/docs/github-backend/">GitHub</a> or <a href="https://decapcms.org/docs/gitlab-backend/">GitLab</a> backend. <ul> <li>Please note that the Git Gateway backend mentioned in the Netlify/Decap CMS <a href="https://decapcms.org/docs/working-with-a-local-git-repository/">local Git repository document</a> is not supported in Sveltia CMS, so <code>name: git-gateway</code> won’t work. You’ll need either <code>name: github</code> or <code>name: gitlab</code> along with the <code>repo</code> definition. If you haven’t determined your repository name yet, just use a random one.</li> <li>You can remove <code>local_backend</code> from your configuration, as it will be ignored by Sveltia CMS.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Launch the local development server for your frontend framework, typically with <code>npm run dev</code> or <code>pnpm dev</code>.</li> <li>Visit <code>http://localhost:[port]/admin/index.html</code> with Chrome or Edge. The port number varies by framework. <ul> <li>Other Chromium-based browsers may also work. Brave user? <a href="https://github.com/sveltia/sveltia-cms#enable-local-development-in-brave">See below</a>.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Click “Work with Local Repository” and select the project’s root directory once prompted. <ul> <li>If you get an error saying “not a repository root directory”, make sure you’ve turned the folder into a repository with either a CUI (<a href="https://github.com/git-guides/git-init"><code>git init</code></a>) or GUI, and the hidden <code>.git</code> folder exists.</li> <li>If you’re using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), you may get an error saying “Can’t open this folder because it contains system files.” This is due to a limitation in the browser, and you can try some workarounds mentioned in <a data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/coder/code-server/issues/4646/hovercard" href="https://github.com/coder/code-server/issues/4646">this issue</a> and <a data-hovercard-type="discussion" data-hovercard-url="/sveltia/sveltia-cms/discussions/101/hovercard" href="https://github.com/sveltia/sveltia-cms/discussions/101">this thread</a>.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Make some changes to your content on Sveltia CMS.</li> <li>See if the produced changes look good using <code>git diff</code> or a GUI like <a href="https://desktop.github.com/">GitHub Desktop</a>.</li> <li>Open the dev site at <code>http://localhost:[port]/</code> to check the rendered pages.</li> <li>Commit and push the changes if satisfied, or discard them if you’re just testing.</li> </ol>
<p>Keep in mind that the local repository support doesn’t perform any Git operations. You’ll have to manually fetch, pull, commit and push all changes using a Git client. In the near future, we’ll figure out if there’s a way to do this in a browser (because <code>netlify-cms-proxy-server</code> actually has undocumented <code>git</code> mode that allows developers to create commits to a local repository).</p>
<p>Also, at this point, you have to reload the CMS to see the latest content after retrieving remote updates. This manual work will be unnecessary once the proposed <code>FileSystemObserver</code> API, which is being <a href="https://issues.chromium.org/issues/40105284">implemented in Chromium</a> behind a flag, becomes available.</p>
<h4>Enable local development in Brave</h4>
<p>In the Brave browser, you must enable the File System Access API with an experiment flag to take advantage of local development.</p>
<ol> <li>Open <code>brave://flags/#file-system-access-api</code> in a new browser tab.</li> <li>Click Default (Disabled) next to File System Access API and select Enabled.</li> <li>Relaunch the browser.</li> </ol>
<h3>Using a custom icon for a collection</h3>
<p>You can specify an icon for each collection for easy identification in the collection list. You don’t need to install a custom icon set because the Material Symbols font file is already loaded for the application UI. Just pick one of the 2,500+ icons:</p>
<ol> <li>Visit the <a href="https://fonts.google.com/icons?icon.set=Material+Symbols&amp;icon.platform=android">Material Symbols</a> page on Google Fonts.</li> <li>Search and select an icon, and copy the icon name displayed on the right panel.</li> <li>Add it to one of your collection definitions in <code>config.yml</code> as the new <code>icon</code> property, like the example below.</li> <li>Repeat the same steps for all the collections if desired.</li> <li>Commit and push the changes to your Git repository.</li> <li>Reload Sveltia CMS once the updated config file is deployed.</li> </ol>
<pre>   - name: tags
     label: Tags
+    icon: sell
     create: true
     folder: data/tags/</pre>
<h3>Adding dividers to the collection list</h3>
<p>Sveltia CMS allows developers to add dividers to the collection list to distinguish different types of collections. To do this, insert a fake collection with the <code>divider: true</code> option along with a random <code>name</code>. In VS Code, you may get a validation error if <code>config.yml</code> is treated as a “Netlify YAML config” file. You can work around this by adding an empty <code>files</code> as well:</p>
<pre>collections:
  - name: products
    ...
  - divider: true
    name: d1 # d2, d3, etc. Should be unique for each divider
    files: []
  - name: pages
    ...</pre>
<h3>Using a custom media folder for a collection</h3>
<p>This is actually not new in Sveltia CMS but rather an <em>undocumented</em> feature in Netlify/Decap CMS<sup><a data-footnote-ref="" href="https://github.com/sveltia/sveltia-cms#user-content-fn-4-d226868c4d739dc87d49b32d4a223d83">122</a></sup>. You can specify media and public folders for each collection that override the <a href="https://decapcms.org/docs/configuration-options/#media-and-public-folders">global media folder</a>. Well, it’s <a href="https://decapcms.org/docs/collection-folder/#media-and-public-folder">documented</a>, but that’s probably not what you want.</p>
<p>Rather, if you’d like to add all the media files for a collection in one single folder, specify both <code>media_folder</code> and <code>public_folder</code> instead of leaving them empty. The trick is to use an <em>absolute path</em> for <code>media_folder</code> like the example below. You can try this with Netlify/Decap CMS first if you prefer.</p>
<pre> media_folder: static/media
 public_folder: /media

 collections:
   - name: products
     label: Products
     create: true
     folder: data/products/
+    media_folder: /static/media/products
+    public_folder: /media/products</pre>
<p>In Sveltia CMS, those per-collection media folders are displayed prominently for easier asset management.</p>
<h3>Using keyboard shortcuts</h3>
<ul> <li>View the Content Library: <code>Alt+1</code></li> <li>View the Asset Library: <code>Alt+2</code></li> <li>Search for entries and assets: <code>Ctrl+F</code> (Windows/Linux) or <code>Command+F</code> (macOS)</li> <li>Create a new entry: <code>Ctrl+E</code> (Windows/Linux) or <code>Command+E</code> (macOS)</li> <li>Save an entry: <code>Ctrl+S</code> (Windows/Linux) or <code>Command+S</code> (macOS)</li> <li>Cancel entry editing: <code>Escape</code></li> </ul>
<h3>Using DeepL to translate entry fields</h3>
<p>Sveltia CMS comes with a handy DeepL integration so that you can translate any text field from another locale without leaving the content editor. To enable the high quality, AI-powered, quick translation feature:</p>
<ol> <li>Update your configuration file to enable the <a href="https://decapcms.org/docs/i18n/">i18n support</a> with multiple locales.</li> <li>Sign up for <a href="https://www.deepl.com/pro-api/">DeepL API</a> and copy your Authentication Key from DeepL’s Account page.</li> <li>Open an entry in Sveltia CMS.</li> <li>Click on the Translation button on the pane header or each field, right next to the 3-dot menu.</li> <li>Paste your key when prompted.</li> <li>The field(s) will be automatically translated.</li> </ol>
<p>Note that the Translation button on the pane header only translates empty fields, while in-field Translation buttons override any filled text.</p>
<p>If you have upgraded to DeepL API Pro, provide your new Authentication Key:</p>
<ol> <li>Click the Account button in the upper right corner, then click Settings.</li> <li>Select the Language tab.</li> <li>Paste your key to the DeepL API Authentication Key field.</li> <li>Close the Settings dialog.</li> </ol>
<h3>Localizing entry slugs</h3>
<p>In Sveltia CMS, it’s possible to localize entry slugs (filenames) if the i18n structure is <code>multiple_files</code> or <code>multiple_folders</code>. All you need is the <code>localize</code> filter for <code>slug</code> template tags:</p>
<pre>i18n:
  structure: multiple_folders
  locales: [en, fr]

slug:
  encoding: ascii
  clean_accents: true

collections:
  - name: posts
    label: Blog posts
    create: true
    folder: data/posts/
    slug: '\{\{title | localize\}\}'
    format: yaml
    i18n: true
    fields:
      - name: title
        label: Title
        widget: string
        i18n: true</pre>
<p>With this configuration, an entry is saved with localized filenames, while the default locale’s slug is stored in each file as an extra <code>translationKey</code> property, which is used in <a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual/#bypassing-default-linking">Hugo’s multilingual support</a>. Sveltia CMS and Hugo read this property to link localized files.</p>
<ul> <li><code>data/posts/en/my-trip-to-new-york.yaml</code> <pre>title: My trip to New York
translationKey: my-trip-to-new-york</pre> </li> <li><code>data/posts/fr/mon-voyage-a-new-york.yaml</code> <pre>title: Mon voyage à New York
translationKey: my-trip-to-new-york</pre> </li> </ul>
<p>You can customize the property name and value for a different framework or i18n library by adding the <code>canonical_slug</code> option to your top-level or per-collection <code>i18n</code> configuration. The example below is for <a href="https://github.com/astrolicious/i18n">@astrolicious/i18n</a>, which requires a locale prefix in the value (<a data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/sveltia/sveltia-cms/issues/137/hovercard" href="https://github.com/sveltia/sveltia-cms/issues/137">discussion</a>):</p>
<pre>i18n:
  canonical_slug:
    key: defaultLocaleVersion # default: translationKey
    value: 'en/\{\{slug\}\}' # default: \{\{slug\}\}</pre>
<p>Or, for <a href="https://migueldavid.eu/how-to-make-jekyll-multilingual-c13e74c18f1c">Jekyll</a>, you may want to use the <code>ref</code> property:</p>
<pre>i18n:
  canonical_slug:
    key: ref</pre>
<h3>Disabling non-default locale content</h3>
<p>You can now disable output of content in selected non-default locales by adding the <code>save_all_locales</code> property to the top-level or per-collection <code>i18n</code> configuration. Then you’ll find “Disable (locale name)” in the three-dot menu in the top right corner of the content editor. This is useful if the translation isn’t ready yet, but you want to publish the default locale content first.</p>
<p>With the following configuration, you can disable the French and/or German translation while writing in English.</p>
<pre> i18n:
   structure: multiple_files
   locales: [en, fr, de]
   default_locale: en
+  save_all_locales: false</pre>
<h3>Using a random ID for an entry slug</h3>
<p>By default, the <a href="https://decapcms.org/docs/configuration-options/#slug">slug for a new entry file</a> will be generated based on the entry’s <code>title</code> field. Or, you can specify the collection’s <code>slug</code> option to use the file creation date or other fields. While the behaviour is generally acceptable and SEO-friendly, it’s not useful if the title might change later or if it contains non-Latin characters like Chinese. In Sveltia CMS, you can easily generate a random <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/UUID">UUID</a> for a slug without a custom widget!</p>
<p>It’s simple — just specify <code>\{\{uuid\}\}</code> (full UUID v4), <code>\{\{uuid_short\}\}</code> (last 12 characters only) or <code>\{\{uuid_shorter\}\}</code> (first 8 characters only) in the <code>slug</code> option. The results would look like <code>4fc0917c-8aea-4ad5-a476-392bdcf3b642</code>, <code>392bdcf3b642</code> and <code>4fc0917c</code>, respectively.</p>
<pre>   - name: members
     label: Members
     create: true
     folder: data/members/
+    slug: '\{\{uuid_short\}\}'</pre>
<h3>Disabling automatic deployments</h3>
<p>You may already have a CI/CD tool set up on your Git repository to automatically deploy changes to production. Occasionally, you make a lot of changes to your content to quickly reach the CI/CD provider’s (free) build limits, or you just don’t want to see builds triggered for every single small change.</p>
<p>With Sveltia CMS, you can disable automatic deployments by default and manually trigger deployments at your convenience. This is done by adding the <code>[skip ci]</code> prefix to commit messages, the convention supported by <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs/skipping-workflow-runs">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipelines/#skip-a-pipeline">GitLab</a>, <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/skip-build/#skip-jobs">CircleCI</a>, <a href="https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/customizing-the-build/#skipping-a-build">Travis CI</a>, <a href="https://docs.netlify.com/site-deploys/manage-deploys/#skip-a-deploy">Netlify</a>, <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/platform/branch-build-controls/#skip-builds">Cloudflare Pages</a> and others. Here are the steps to use it:</p>
<ol> <li>Add the new <code>automatic_deployments</code> property to your <code>backend</code> configuration with a value of <code>false</code>: <pre> backend:
   name: github
   repo: owner/repo
   branch: main
+  automatic_deployments: false</pre> </li> <li>Commit and deploy the change to the config file and reload the CMS.</li> <li>Now, whenever you save an entry or asset, <code>[skip ci]</code> is automatically added to each commit message. However, deletions are always committed without the prefix to avoid unexpected data retention on your site.</li> <li>If you want to deploy a new or updated entry, as well as any other unpublished entries and assets, click an arrow next to the Save button in the content editor, then select <strong>Save and Publish</strong>. This will trigger CI/CD by omitting <code>[skip ci]</code>.</li> </ol>
<p>If you set <code>automatic_deployments</code> to <code>true</code>, the behaviour is reversed. CI/CD will be triggered by default, while you have an option to <strong>Save without Publishing</strong> that adds <code>[skip ci]</code> only to the associated commit.</p>
<p><em>Gotcha:</em> Unpublished entries and assets are not drafts. Once committed to your repository, those changes can be deployed any time another commit is pushed without <code>[skip ci]</code>, or when a manual deployment is triggered.</p>
<p>If the <code>automatic_deployments</code> property is defined, you can manually trigger a deployment by selecting <strong>Publish Changes</strong> under the Account button in the top right corner of the CMS. To use this feature:</p>
<ul> <li>GitHub Actions: <ol> <li>Without any configuration, Publish Changes will <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/rest/repos/repos#create-a-repository-dispatch-event">trigger a <code>repository_dispatch</code> event</a> with the <code>sveltia-cms-publish</code> event type. Update your build workflow to receive this event: <pre> on:
   push:
     branches: [$default-branch]
+  repository_dispatch:
+    types: [sveltia-cms-publish]</pre> </li> </ol> </li> <li>Other CI/CD providers: <ol> <li>Select Settings under the Account button in the top right corner of the CMS.</li> <li>Select the Advanced tab.</li> <li>Enter the deploy hook URL for your provider, e.g. <a href="https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/build-hooks/">Netlify</a> or <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/platform/deploy-hooks/">Cloudflare Pages</a>.</li> <li>Configure the CSP if necessary. See below.</li> </ol> </li> </ul>
<h3>Setting up Content Security Policy</h3>
<p>If your site adopts Content Security Policy (CSP), use the following policy for Sveltia CMS, or some features may not work.</p>
<pre><code>style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://fonts.googleapis.com;
font-src 'self' https://fonts.gstatic.com;
img-src 'self' blob: data:;
media-src blob:;
frame-src blob:;
script-src 'self' https://unpkg.com;
connect-src 'self' blob: data: https://unpkg.com;
</code></pre>
<p>Then, add the following origins depending on your Git backend and enabled integrations.</p>
<ul> <li>GitHub: (If you’re running a GitHub Enterprise Server, you’ll also need to add the origin to these directives.) <ul> <li><code>img-src</code> <pre><code>https://*.githubusercontent.com
</code></pre> </li> <li><code>connect-src</code> <pre><code>https://api.github.com https://www.githubstatus.com
</code></pre> </li> </ul> </li> <li>GitLab: (If you’re running a self-hosted instance, you’ll also need to add the origin to these directives.) <ul> <li><code>img-src</code> <pre><code>https://gitlab.com https://secure.gravatar.com
</code></pre> </li> <li><code>connect-src</code> <pre><code>https://gitlab.com https://status-api.hostedstatus.com
</code></pre> </li> </ul> </li> <li>Pexels: <ul> <li><code>img-src</code> <pre><code>https://images.pexels.com
</code></pre> </li> <li><code>connect-src</code> <pre><code>https://images.pexels.com https://api.pexels.com
</code></pre> </li> </ul> </li> <li>Pixabay: <ul> <li><code>img-src</code> <pre><code>https://pixabay.com
</code></pre> </li> <li><code>connect-src</code> <pre><code>https://pixabay.com
</code></pre> </li> </ul> </li> <li>Unsplash: <ul> <li><code>img-src</code> <pre><code>https://images.unsplash.com
</code></pre> </li> <li><code>connect-src</code> <pre><code>https://images.unsplash.com https://api.unsplash.com
</code></pre> </li> </ul> </li> <li>DeepL API Free: <ul> <li><code>connect-src</code> <pre><code>https://api-free.deepl.com
</code></pre> </li> </ul> </li> <li>DeepL API Pro: <ul> <li><code>connect-src</code> <pre><code>https://api.deepl.com
</code></pre> </li> </ul> </li> <li>YouTube: <ul> <li><code>frame-src</code> <pre><code>https://www.youtube-nocookie.com
</code></pre> </li> </ul> </li> </ul>
<p>If you choose to <a href="https://github.com/sveltia/sveltia-cms#disabling-automatic-deployments">disable automatic deployments</a> and have configured a webhook URL, you may need to add the origin to the <code>connect-src</code> directive. For example,</p>
<ul> <li>Netlify: <ul> <li><code>connect-src</code> <pre><code>https://api.netlify.com
</code></pre> </li> </ul> </li> <li>Cloudflare Pages <ul> <li><code>connect-src</code> <pre><code>https://api.cloudflare.com
</code></pre> </li> </ul> </li> </ul>
<p>If you have image field(s) and expect that images will be inserted as URLs, you may want to allow any source using a wildcard instead of specifying individual origins:</p>
<pre><code>img-src 'self' blob: data: https://*;
</code></pre>
