<p>Following a couple of months’ testing, Norway-based browser company Opera has finally made its AI-powered browser, Neon, available to the public — though you’ll have to shell out $19.90 per month to use it.</p>
<p>Opera first unveiled Neon <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/28/operas-new-browser-can-code-websites-and-games-for-you/">earlier this year in May</a> and launched it in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/30/opera-launches-its-ai-centric-neon-browser/">early access to select users in October</a>.</p>
<p>Similar to other AI-first browsers like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/09/perplexity-launches-comet-an-ai-powered-web-browser/">Perplexity’s Comet</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/21/openai-launches-an-ai-powered-browser-chatgpt-atlas/">OpenAI’s Atlas</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/03/dias-ai-browser-starts-adding-arcs-greatest-hits-to-its-feature-set/">The Browser Company’s Dia</a>, Neon bakes in an AI chatbot into its interface, letting you ask it answers about pages, use it to create mini apps and videos, and get it to do tasks for you. The browser uses your browsing history as context, so you can do things like ask it to fetch details from a YouTube video you watched last week or the post that you read yesterday.</p>
<p>You can also build “Cards” for repeatable tasks using prompts, and the browser offers a deep research agent that can get you detailed information about any topic. The browser also has a new tab organizational feature called Tasks, which are contained workspaces of AI chats and tabs. This feature is more like Tab Groups combined with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/25/arc-browser-is-now-available-to-download-for-everyone/">Arc Browser’s Spaces feature</a>, which has its own context for AI.</p>

<p>In addition to the AI features, the subscription gives users access to top models like Gemini 3 Pro, GPT-5.1, Veo 3.1, and Nano Banana Pro. Subscribers will also get access to Opera’s Discord community and direct access to its developers.</p>
<p>“Opera Neon is a product for people who like to be the first to the newest AI tech. It’s a rapidly evolving project with significant updates released every week. We’ve been shaping it with our Founders community for a while and are now excited to share the early access to it with a larger audience,” Krystian Kolondra, EVP of browsers at Opera, said in a statement.</p>

<p>The company noted that its other products, like Opera One, Opera GX, and Opera Air, also have free AI features, like a chat-based assistant.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, browser incumbents are taking a slower approach to adding AI features to their products. Earlier this week, Google detailed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/08/google-details-security-measures-for-chromes-agentic-features/">the security work it is doing</a> to protect users against different attack surfaces that agentic features are prone to, and Brave said on Wednesday it is previewing its <a href="https://brave.com/blog/ai-browsing/">agentic features in a nightly build</a>, and provides an isolated browsing profile for using AI features so users can keep their regular, non-AI usage separate.</p>
