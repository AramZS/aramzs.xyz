title: Our Corrupt Congress Just Quietly Killed Military Right To Repair Reforms
---
<h3>from the <i>this-is-why-we-can't-have-nice-things</i> dept</h3>
<p>We’ve covered how there’s <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2025/03/10/all-50-states-have-now-pushed-right-to-repair-laws-but-actual-enforcement-is-spotty-at-best/">a real push afoot</a> to implement statewide “right to repair” laws that try to make it cheaper, easier, and environmentally friendlier for you to repair the technology you own. Unfortunately, while <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2025/03/10/all-50-states-have-now-pushed-right-to-repair-laws-but-actual-enforcement-is-spotty-at-best/">all fifty states have at least flirted with the idea</a>, only Massachusetts, New York, Minnesota, Colorado, California, and Oregon, and Washington have actually passed laws.</p>
<p>And among those states, not one has actually enforced them despite a wide array of ongoing corporate offenses (though to be fair to states there is <em>kind of a lot going on</em>).</p>
<p>This reform movement, which sees broad bipartisan support, had even started to reach toward the military, which is probably the poster child for over-billing, dysfunctional repair monopoly, “<a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/69320/how-parts-pairing-kills-independent-repair">parts pairing</a>,” and other predatory efforts to jack up the cost of maintenance and ownership.</p>
<p>Back in June we mentioned how Army Secretary Daniel Driscoll had <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2025/06/10/the-u-s-army-embraces-right-to-repair-at-least-superficially/">committed to including</a> right-to-repair requirements in all existing and future Army contracts with manufacturers. Some very light language to this effect was to be included in the latest National Defense Authorization Act by Democrat Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Republican Tim Sheehy of Montana.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://federalnewsnetwork.com/congress/2025/11/senator-accuses-defense-industry-of-blocking-congress-right-to-repair-reforms/">Driscoll offered up a useful example of why reform is important</a>:</p>
<blockquote> <p>“<em>Driscoll recently pointed to a Black Hawk helicopter part to show how contractor restrictions drive up costs. The original equipment manufacturer refuses to repair or replace a small screen-control knob that grounds the aircraft when it breaks — forcing the Army to purchase an entire new screen assembly for <strong>$47,000</strong>. Driscoll said the Army could make the knob for just <strong>$15</strong>.”</em></p> </blockquote>
<p>Picture that problem, at scale, across the entirety of U.S. military hardware, planet wide.</p>
<p>But despite the bipartisan popularity of right to repair reforms, companies weren’t keen on losing money via a government crackdown on their grift. So the various policy and lobbying fronts for America’s defense contractors spent much of this fall <a href="https://rollcall.com/2025/11/17/defense-contractors-fight-back-against-ndaa-repair-language/">trying to frame the modest reforms as an affront on innovation</a> to scuttle the reforms as the House and Senate debate over bill versions.</p>
<p>And guess what, <a href="https://federalnewsnetwork.com/congress/2025/12/congress-quietly-strips-right-to-repair-provisions-from-2026-ndaa-despite-wide-support/">they succeeded</a>:</p>
<blockquote> <p><em>“The House’s Data-as-a-Service Solutions for Weapon System Contracts provision, which would have required DoD to negotiate access to technical data and necessary software before signing a contract, was removed from the final text of the annual legislation released over the weekend. The Senate’s provision requiring contractors to provide the military with detailed repair and maintenance instructions was dropped from the bill as well.</em></p> <p><em>Instead, the legislation requires the Defense Department to develop a digital system that would track and manage all technical data and verify whether contractors and subcontractors comply with contract requirements related to technical data. The compromise version of the bill also requires DoD to review all existing contracts to determine what contractors were required to deliver and what data DoD can access.”</em></p> </blockquote>
<p>That’s basically worthless bureaucracy as it applies to any sort of meaningful right to repair reforms.</p>
<p>Again, these reforms were about as basic as they get. Still, they would have likely opened the door to taxpayers saving billions of dollars annually when it comes to paying too much for the repair and maintenance of U.S. military equipment. It was a no brainer reform, but <strong>because the United States is genuinely too corrupt to function</strong>, even that was ultimately a bridge too far.</p>
<p>To add insult to injury, we’ve got fake Trump populists and Silicon Valley execs like Elon Musk running around pretending they care about efficiency. But in instances like this, where there’s real potential to improve government efficiency, you’ll notice they’re nowhere to be found because the reforms would interfere with their ability to rip off the public.</p>
