<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) today confirmed <a data-extlink="" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"><u>30 more</u></a> measles cases reported in the United States this past week, raising the national total to 1,828 confirmed cases so far in 2025.</p>
<p>Current US hot spots are Utah, Arizona, and South Carolina, where outbreaks among predominately unvaccinated or under-vaccinated people have led to community spread and widespread quarantines at schools.</p>
<p>In total, the country has had 46 outbreaks this year of three or more cases; for comparison, 16 outbreaks were reported during all of 2024.</p>
<p><a data-extlink="" href="https://www.azdhs.gov/preparedness/epidemiology-disease-control/measles/index.php"><u>Today Arizona</u></a> officials said there are now 155 measles cases in that state, 151 of which are in Mohave County. The total represents two new cases, both in Mohave County.</p>
<p>Arizona officials said 97% of people who have gotten measles this year in the state are unvaccinated. Nationally, 92% of measles patients this year are unvaccinated or have unknown vaccination status, while 4% each have one dose of measles-containing vaccine or two full doses.</p>
<h3><strong>RSV activity rising</strong></h3>
<p><a data-extlink="" href="https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/data/index.html"><u>This week </u></a>the CDC resumed publishing data on its respiratory illness channel, following a similar return of the weekly <a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/influenza-general/us-flu-activity-rise"><u>FluView report</u></a>.</p>
<p>Nationally, respiratory illness activity is low, but there are increasing reports of seasonal flu activity among children and young adults. COVID-19 activity is low across the country.</p>
<p>Only three states reported moderate acute respiratory illness activity: Louisiana, Alabama, and New Hampshire.</p>
<p>RSV activity is on the rise in the South and Southeaste, with increased emergency department visits among children ages 0 to 5 years, the CDC said.</p>
<p>The CDC added that it will be updating respiratory surveillance data on Fridays, the same day <u>FluView</u> is published.</p>
