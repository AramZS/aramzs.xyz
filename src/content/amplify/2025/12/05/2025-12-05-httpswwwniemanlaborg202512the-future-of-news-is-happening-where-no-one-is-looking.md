<p>“In 2026, more news organizations will understand that people don’t always want an article. Sometimes they just want clarity.”</p>
<p>-he-future-of-news-is-happening-where-no-one-is-lo</p>
<p>Every December, when Nieman Lab asks for predictions, I think: <em>Why ask journalists to forecast the future when most of us are still forecasting payroll?</em> But this year, I have a clearer sense of where things are headed.</p>
<p>In 2026, the people shaping the future of news won’t be in newsrooms. They won’t have titles, Slack channels, or even the faintest interest in CMS redesigns. Many won’t call what they do “journalism.” But they’ll be doing the work anyway — often more effectively than the institutions built for it.</p>
<p>I spend a lot of time in Haitian and immigrant communities across the United States. In Brooklyn, Miami, Chicago, and the Midwest, I keep seeing the same thing: the people keeping their communities informed aren’t reporters. They’re the pastor who delivers immigration updates before the sermon. The barber who streams local politics on Facebook Live. The neighbor who translates every school notice and distributes it through five different group chats. The teacher who explains American bureaucracy to families who arrived last week. The WhatsApp moderator running a rumor-control operation that outperforms the mayor’s office.</p>
<p>None of these people will keynote a journalism conference. But if journalism is about helping people understand their world, they are quietly doing the job. And that’s my prediction for 2026: the news industry will finally realize that these informal community information networks are not peripheral to local news — they are the most functional version of it.</p>
<p>For years, local newsrooms have debated how to “engage audiences.” Meanwhile, immigrant communities have treated information as a survival system. I’ve watched families gather after long shifts to collectively decipher government letters. I’ve seen multilingual WhatsApp threads get crucial facts out hours before official channels. I’ve watched regular people become translators, navigators, and explainers — not out of civic theory, but because someone needed help and they could offer it. In 2026, more news organizations will understand that people don’t always want an article. Sometimes they just want clarity.</p>
<p>And clarity rarely arrives in one language anymore. Newsrooms still talk about translation like it’s innovation; communities treat it like a Tuesday. The future isn’t bilingual — it’s what I’ve come to think of as “messy-lingual,” with English, Spanish, Creole, Arabic, Portuguese, Amharic, Tagalog, and more all in play, often within the same apartment building. Outlets that embrace that complexity will grow. The ones waiting for a cultural rewind will keep shrinking.</p>
<p>Somewhere in 2026, an editor or funder will ask a question I now hear everywhere: <em>“Why are the tiny, overworked immigrant outlets pulling off what we’ve been trying to do for a decade?”</em> The answer isn’t mysterious. These outlets had no choice. They operate inside communities, not at the edge of them. And when life gets confusing — and life is very confusing right now — people don’t look for content. They look for a guide.</p>
<p>So if you want a glimpse of the future of news, don’t look at dashboards or innovation labs. Look at the barbershop, the church hall, the group chat, the neighbor who becomes a newsroom by necessity. That’s where the future is already taking shape. In 2026, the rest of the industry will finally notice.</p>
