    Whether or not you agree with Owen Yingling’s argument, or even the premise, that literary fiction has declined, his viral Substack post is singularly thought-provoking and insightful. At Bloomberg we always try to follow the money, and it was fascinating to see Yingling combine an analysis of the economics of writing with cultural criticism to investigate why great works of literary art get produced, or don’t.

    One of my all-time faves is William Langewiesche, who sadly passed away this year. He wrote about flights and disasters (often disastrous flights) with unmatched precision. Robert Weintraub shares the gift for turning disaster into revelation. Few images stay in the mind like his doomed airship straining to rise from the dark Atlantic. I miss Langewiesche. I hope Weintraub keeps carrying that spirit forward.

I admire not only her reporting but also the way she writes about the media landscape and the realities of being an independent journalist.

    Retail is detail, as the saying goes, and this deep dive into Costco is brimming with it. Not only does the piece capture the quirks that make Costco what it is—$1.50 hot dogs, the $300,000 worth of cashews sold every week—but Molly Fischer also nails how the company’s refusal to compromise its values has helped it build a cult following.

    It’s already terrific time-traveling to reflect on life in American kitchens pre-Julia Child, the outsize influence of Top Chef, before Americans knew of televised cooking competitions, and how the 2008 recession got us addicted to food trucks. Then you get to consider how diners became fans and reminisce about the time it was actually a good thing to be called a foodie. This is an epic recounting of our culinary journey, and I’m here for it.
