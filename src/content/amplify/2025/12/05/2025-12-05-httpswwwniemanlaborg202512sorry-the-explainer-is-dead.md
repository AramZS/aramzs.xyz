<p>“Here’s the type of content losing to AI: Explainers, how-tos, evergreens, aggregated news, resource lists, hours of operation for government offices, recipes.”</p>
<p>Remember when we told journalists to write more explainers? Yeah, sorry about that.</p>
<p>We said the future of journalism was a broader take on news, one that was more focused on utility information to help readers navigate their lives. We said, more explainers, more news-you-can-use, more recipes!</p>
<p>Today, our readers query AI for all that stuff, whether it’s ChatGPT or the AI summaries at the top of a Google search. They like the AI answers well enough and they don’t click on article links, leading many publishers to predict a total loss of search referrals (and accompanying revenue) in the very near future.</p>
<p>But not all publishers. Some media brands are doing just fine, reporting flat or even growing traffic from search over the past two years. A super-loyal fan base helps, but so does the nature of the news they produce.</p>
<p>Here’s the type of content losing to AI: explainers, how-tos, evergreens, aggregated news, resource lists, hours of operation for government offices, recipes.</p>
<p>The winning content? Hyperlocal news, breaking news (as it happens), scoops, notable first-person narratives, and investigative journalism. AI can’t or won’t summarize this information because it’s too recent or too unique. And there’s good reason to believe the bots won’t figure out how to do it — maybe ever, but at least not in 2026.</p>
<p>Like many of you, I’ve been thinking a lot about how we human journalists fit in the AI-mediated future. My prediction is that we go back to the basics.</p>

<p>Each year, we ask some of the smartest people in digital media what they think is coming in the year ahead. Here's what they told us.</p>
<p>“Visual investigations are poised to move from niche desks to standard operating procedure in newsrooms in 2025.”</p>
<p>“A great deal of language that looks a lot like Christian Nationalism isn’t actually calling for theocracy; it is secular minoritarianism pushed by secular people, often linked to rightwing cable and other media with zero meaningful ties to the church or theological principle.”</p>
<p>“Many publishers remain anchored to hierarchies born in the print era, with editorial at the center and product and technology bolted on as afterthoughts.”</p>
<p>“Some pivots, once deemed infeasible, might be worth a second look using new technology.”</p>
<p>“Trolling was tricky enough to deal with when it existed around the edges of policy. Now it <em>is</em> policy.”</p>
<p>“Every item that could be stripped out because it contained enough value to stand on its own was, sometimes by the very news organizations themselves.”</p>
<p>“There’s no evidence that moving to a both-sidesy middle will bring in new readers, and plenty of evidence it won’t.”</p>
<p>“The U.S. isn’t immune to this risk and the loss of protections for independent journalism we’ve guarded for so long. Perhaps this has been a very needed wakeup call.”</p>
<p>“Audience engagement has been narrowly tackled by our industry for far too long, often treated as a side initiative rather than a central purpose of journalism.”</p>
<p>“When journalists take the time to explain these layers, it signals respect for the intelligence and curiosity of their audience.”</p>
<p>“Joe Rogan is a symptom of changing media systems, not the root cause.”</p>
<p>“Ask someone in your life under 40 where they get the news. Odds are they’ll mention a non-newsroom podcaster or YouTuber.”</p>
<p>“What’s the point of the exercise here? Is it to inform people, or to show off what we know and how sophisticated we sound?”</p>
<p>“Audience engagement has been narrowly tackled by our industry for far too long, often treated as a side initiative rather than a central purpose of journalism.”</p>
<p>“Early visibility creates more time, more time strengthens verification, better verification builds a clearer evidence trail, and that clarity improves trust. Instead of reacting to an announcement, a newsroom arrives with context already in place.”</p>
<p>“The best, most rigorous journalism in the world is powerless to effect change unless it reaches and is trusted by the wider public — however profitable it may be to serve a niche, hyper-engaged subset of the public.”</p>
<p>“Journalists risk losing their audiences through enactments of authenticity that, at their core, may be perceived less as genuine humanness and more as illusory performance.”</p>
<p>“But most governance — even extreme governance — is banal. If Project 2025 is anything to go by, journalists need to focus more on the boring minutiae of policymaking and not on the sensationalism of politics.”</p>
<p>“Some pivots, once deemed infeasible, might be worth a second look using new technology.”</p>
<p>“Today’s media faces a paradox: Professionals want constant updates and insights but suffer from overwhelming information streams.”</p>
<p>“For many organizations, what I’m describing requires culture change. The ‘good’ news is that things are now desperate enough for most that change is the only choice.”</p>
<p>“Despite the sometimes barely concealed vitriol poured out by some pundits over AI as information gateways, public AI adoption and attitudes paint a different picture.”</p>
<p>“In optimizing walled gardens of like-minded folks, we’ve forgotten how to create the conditions for us to safely and openly disagree.”</p>
<p>“Preserving public broadcasting in its current form is not an option. So let’s hold hands together and leap.”</p>
<p>“The next phase of our work as newsrooms must be in looking to joyous experiences.”</p>
<p>“We’ve overindexed on problem articulation, to the point of problem admiring. The risk is that we are analyzing ourselves into inaction and irrelevance.”</p>
<p>“2025 should be an opportunity to ask ourselves if we are in a position to cover people fairly.”</p>
<p>“The printed page offers our minds a break from those hits of dopamine that distracted us from thinking, feeling, and doing more important things.”</p>
<p>“Consumers will continue to rely on local reporters that live and work in their community to validate information.”</p>
<p>“Think of it as the Dominion Voting System strategy for journalism.”</p>
<p>“Despite the sometimes barely concealed vitriol poured out by some pundits over AI as information gateways, public AI adoption and attitudes paint a different picture.”</p>
<p>“We can continue to complain about this new generation of content creators and how those in power use them to amplify their messages of hate — or we can adapt and fight for truth, freedom of expression, and democracy.”</p>
<p>“What’s the point of the exercise here? Is it to inform people, or to show off what we know and how sophisticated we sound?”</p>
<p>“They’re choosing compliance with eyes wide open, trading their watchdog role for a seat at the billionaire’s table.”</p>
<p>“We’ve overindexed on problem articulation, to the point of problem admiring. The risk is that we are analyzing ourselves into inaction and irrelevance.”</p>
<p>“It’s not fun to contemplate death, I know.”</p>
<p>“Think of it as the Dominion Voting System strategy for journalism.”</p>
<p>“We’re shifting from products designed to be ‘usable by everyone’ to products that are ‘customizable by everyone.'”</p>
<p>“Any time you hear about publishers using AI to produce journalism as if it’s factory output, that’s when you know they’ll have a bad year ahead.”</p>
<p>“Technology will finally help journalists give their audience members a better version of the news article, one which favors understanding, not just informing.”</p>
<p>“Every president claims a mandate and a decisive victory, but saying so doesn’t make it so. Media coverage is crucial for determining the scope of that power.”</p>
<p>“Much like the state-controlled media systems of the late Soviet Union, the mainstream media has become the <em>nomenklatura</em> of our era — privileged, insular, and increasingly out of touch with the realities of the populations they claim to serve.”</p>
<p>“How can public engagement be harnessed productively, to provide well-rounded feedback that takes into account ideas, sentiment, and knowledge from throughout the community while still providing cogent insight?”</p>
<p>“News organizations will become loose confederations of news creators and supporting services.”</p>
<p>“Training the next generation of journalists means preparing them to be global citizens.”</p>
<p>“The newest generation of journalists will not give in to pessimism about whether their profession still matters in an age of cynicism about the press.”</p>
<p>“It’s not enough to just drop something into the laps of local teams and hope they’ll use it exactly as-is.”</p>
<p>“It grieves me to predict that even the newsrooms who say they want to serve all Americans won’t do any of this. At best, they will mostly continue to ignore the problem. At worst, some journalists will blame the audience.”</p>
<p>“In 2025, journalists will acknowledge that people’s skepticism toward news is fundamentally tied up in their unflattering misunderstandings about how journalists — and the organizations they work for — make money.”</p>
<p>“It’s not enough to just drop something into the laps of local teams and hope they’ll use it exactly as-is.”</p>
<p>“In optimizing walled gardens of like-minded folks, we’ve forgotten how to create the conditions for us to safely and openly disagree.”</p>
<p>“The main reasons people aren’t more engaged with news are far more mundane than what the conventional wisdom suggests.”</p>
<p>“The newest generation of journalists will not give in to pessimism about whether their profession still matters in an age of cynicism about the press.”</p>
<p>“News organizations will have to reckon with their use of designs that place them in the same categories as annoying sales sites and scammers.”</p>
<p>“The standalone Audience team/department/function, as we know it, is dead.”</p>
<p>“They’re choosing compliance with eyes wide open, trading their watchdog role for a seat at the billionaire’s table.”</p>
<p>“Journalism as a social service is about helping people and communities become the best versions of themselves. That’s something another 100 years of Pulitzer Prizes will not achieve.”</p>
<p>“The key is inviting everyone who touches a story from beginning to end to be a part of the conversation.”</p>
<p>“They’re choosing compliance with eyes wide open, trading their watchdog role for a seat at the billionaire’s table.”</p>
<p>“AI-driven accessibility isn’t only better product design but also good business.”</p>
<p>“Journalists can fall into a trap of parroting the language provided by officials, whether that’s law enforcement, the courts, politicians, academics, or subject-matter experts.”</p>
<p>“We got here through nearly 600 years of editorial choices, in one story after the other, from the birth of the printing press to today.”</p>
<p>“When journalists around the world are being killed for practicing their freedom of press, journalists have no choice but to become activists.”</p>
<p>“Audiences are embracing human-curated content delivered through both digital and analog channels.”</p>
<p>“This moment will inevitably require newsrooms, and journalists, to change. But when hasn’t that been the case?”</p>
<p>“To ensure state funding includes effective safeguards, several countries have developed schemes that could serve as potential best practices.”</p>
<p>“Free content will be increasingly synonymous with AI slop and other low-quality content that’s barely worth anyone’s time to read, let alone pay to advertise on.”</p>
<p>“Audiences need to ‘try before they buy.'”</p>
<p>“It was never about the size of inventory and the pricing. It isn’t about the transaction. Independent bookstores are about relationships and community.”</p>
<p>“Newsrooms will need to create new products in the broadening domain of what used to be called fact-checking.”</p>
<p>“We got here through nearly 600 years of editorial choices, in one story after the other, from the birth of the printing press to today.”</p>
<p>“Why is formalizing AI adoption necessary? Experimentation, while valuable, has its limits.”</p>
<p>“Far too many in this country were uninformed, misinformed, or simply lied to about the topics that journalism is meant to communicate clearly, truthfully, and widely.”</p>
<p>“Why is formalizing AI adoption necessary? Experimentation, while valuable, has its limits.”</p>
<p>“Insurgents succeed because they know exactly what they are fighting against.”</p>
<p>“The industry will need to sift through the irrational exuberance around AI and drive more discipline around spend.”</p>
<p>“In our increasingly complex world, to really think about the future of news, we have to think across disciplines: technology platforms, youth trends, global public health, and civic institutions.”</p>
<p>“Journalists are already content creators and even ‘influencers.’ They’re simply asking to get paid for it.”</p>
<p>“Our industry has an unfortunate history of having disruptive emerging technologies inflicted upon it, putting us on the defensive and forcing us to begrudgingly adapt. But this time around, it feels like we’re taking some welcome initiative.”</p>
<p>“Journalists will continue to need to be more thoughtful and report news not like a season of ‘Survivor: City Hall’ but on the larger issues with longer-term effects.”</p>
<p>“2025 will be a year with fewer shooting stars, but we’ll start building constellations in a broader night sky.”</p>
<p>“Instead of rewarding these things with fair pay, job security and moral support, journalism as an industry exploits their love of the craft.”</p>
<p>“We cannot be neutral about this, by definition. A free press that doesn’t agitate for democracy is an oxymoron.”</p>
<p>“Journalists who were and remain rightfully skeptical of AI and its impact on our profession — from eliminating jobs to adding to the public’s souring on our trustworthiness — are starting to build stuff. Good stuff.”</p>
<p>“The next great digital media product will capture all of the best qualities of an old-fashioned newspaper, and more.”</p>
<p>“The media and tech industries, frequently to the dismay of both, are deeply and inextricably intertwined.”</p>
<p>“We don’t need to sustain our astonishment or tap into our own panic and worry every time he says or does something heretofore unfathomable. (After all, it’s all fathomable now?)”</p>
<p>“To ensure state funding includes effective safeguards, several countries have developed schemes that could serve as potential best practices.”</p>
<p>“In 2025, journalists will acknowledge that people’s skepticism toward news is fundamentally tied up in their unflattering misunderstandings about how journalists — and the organizations they work for — make money.”</p>
<p>“There’s no evidence that moving to a both-sidesy middle will bring in new readers, and plenty of evidence it won’t.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps it’s time to look to organizations that have long been working at the margins as operating models in a more constrained future.”</p>
<p>“We cannot be neutral about this, by definition. A free press that doesn’t agitate for democracy is an oxymoron.”</p>
<p>“Every president claims a mandate and a decisive victory, but saying so doesn’t make it so. Media coverage is crucial for determining the scope of that power.”</p>
<p>“Technology will finally help journalists give their audience members a better version of the news article, one which favors understanding, not just informing.”</p>
<p>“News organizations will increasingly rely on digital creators not just as amplifiers but as integral partners in storytelling.”</p>
<p>“Just like songwriters, journalists have the right to own their creative output separate and apart from the right to publish and distribute that output.”</p>
<p>“It’s not fun to contemplate death, I know.”</p>
<p>“Somewhere in the future, beyond 2025, a flourishing landscape of adequately financed, equitable media enterprises will deliver impactful content, serve diverse communities, and achieve financial independence.”</p>
<p>“Many publishers remain anchored to hierarchies born in the print era, with editorial at the center and product and technology bolted on as afterthoughts.”</p>
<p>“The facts about the current state of the news business are well known — to the point where they’re not exactly news.”</p>
<p>“The news sector must jettison many traditional practices and adapt/adopt creative approaches to entice news consumers and news avoiders to want to stay informed.”</p>
<p>“To ensure state funding includes effective safeguards, several countries have developed schemes that could serve as potential best practices.”</p>
<p>“Any time you hear about publishers using AI to produce journalism as if it’s factory output, that’s when you know they’ll have a bad year ahead.”</p>
<p>“Visual investigations are poised to move from niche desks to standard operating procedure in newsrooms in 2025.”</p>
<p>“Newsrooms will need to create new products in the broadening domain of what used to be called fact-checking.”</p>
<p>“As the overall news industry continues to face more cuts and the less-is-more strategy in 2025, journalism educators will need to continue to be realistic about how to best prepare students for the future profession.”</p>
<p>“Visual investigations are poised to move from niche desks to standard operating procedure in newsrooms in 2025.”</p>
<p>“It won’t be long before AI is used to generate new metrics and new analysis, and to push user behavior further away from curated editorial experiences.”</p>
<p>“Alt text not only makes the content accessible but also enhances search engine optimization and improves the newsroom’s reach. It also just makes your news organization look like you have your shit together.”</p>
<p>“It may be a challenge to find a writer who can channel the viewpoint of the American voters who favored Donald Trump in 2024 while still honoring the principles of responsible journalism.”</p>
<p>“The news sector must jettison many traditional practices and adapt/adopt creative approaches to entice news consumers and news avoiders to want to stay informed.”</p>

<p>“News organizations will increasingly rely on digital creators not just as amplifiers but as integral partners in storytelling.”</p>
<p>“We need mission-based funding — financial support that reflects our mission, not one that forces us to conform to commercial models that don’t work for us.”</p>
<p>“The printed page offers our minds a break from those hits of dopamine that distracted us from thinking, feeling, and doing more important things.”</p>
<p>“While perceived authenticity has always been an important piece of evaluating trustworthiness, <em>performed</em> authenticity has become much more important than ever before because of social media.”</p>
<p>“If we tell readers, listeners and viewers that the sky is falling every day, we should not be surprised if they fail to react qualitatively differently if it really does fall one day.”</p>
<p>“It will be the educators’ job to direct students in the most effective ways to use AI to extend their capabilities, not replace them.”</p>
<p>“Somewhere in the future, beyond 2025, a flourishing landscape of adequately financed, equitable media enterprises will deliver impactful content, serve diverse communities, and achieve financial independence.”</p>
<p>“What’s the point of the exercise here? Is it to inform people, or to show off what we know and how sophisticated we sound?”</p>
<p>“The U.S. isn’t immune to this risk and the loss of protections for independent journalism we’ve guarded for so long. Perhaps this has been a very needed wakeup call.”</p>
<p>“The facts about the current state of the news business are well known — to the point where they’re not exactly news.”</p>
<p>“They provide reporting power, youthful energy, and diverse viewpoints that can help expand audiences.”</p>
<p>“The facts about the current state of the news business are well known — to the point where they’re not exactly news.”</p>
<p>“This election was decided in no small part by voters who believed a number of false things about the candidates and the country. The Fourth Estate has failed.”</p>
<p>“If you’d been elected to some local position in the past year, my call was probably your first time ever dealing with a journalist. That had never been true in my past jobs.”</p>
<p>“It grieves me to predict that even the newsrooms who say they want to serve all Americans won’t do any of this. At best, they will mostly continue to ignore the problem. At worst, some journalists will blame the audience.”</p>
<p>“In 2026, more news organizations will understand that people don’t always want an article. Sometimes they just want clarity.”</p>
<p>“The main reasons people aren’t more engaged with news are far more mundane than what the conventional wisdom suggests.”</p>
<p>“Welcome, surely. Lucrative, in a sense. Game changer? Hardly.”</p>
<p>“What if reporting on racist, misogynist, dehumanizing opinions and comments has the opposite effect from what most journalists intend — normalizing propaganda and even making political candidates seem interesting?”</p>
<p>“Free content will be increasingly synonymous with AI slop and other low-quality content that’s barely worth anyone’s time to read, let alone pay to advertise on.”</p>
<p>“Journalists risk losing their audiences through enactments of authenticity that, at their core, may be perceived less as genuine humanness and more as illusory performance.”</p>
<p>“The gap between mainstream media readers, people who get most of their news through influencers or partisan social media, and people who barely think about news at all will create a fundamental schism in how Americans see the world.”</p>
<p>“The news sector must jettison many traditional practices and adapt/adopt creative approaches to entice news consumers and news avoiders to want to stay informed.”</p>
<p>“If your taxonomy labels everything simply as ‘video’ or ‘analysis,’ you’re rendering critical data points invisible.”</p>
<p>“If your taxonomy labels everything simply as ‘video’ or ‘analysis,’ you’re rendering critical data points invisible.”</p>
<p>“It will combine compelling imagery, quality news gathering, and timely reporting to bring the clarity and scope we currently expect from television news directly to our personal devices.”</p>
<p>“Newsrooms will need to create new products in the broadening domain of what used to be called fact-checking.”</p>
<p>“Journalists will continue to take matters into their own hands — or spreadsheets — either as entrepreneurs striking out on their own or innovators in established and legacy institutions.”</p>
<p>“We don’t need to sustain our astonishment or tap into our own panic and worry every time he says or does something heretofore unfathomable. (After all, it’s all fathomable now?)”</p>
<p>“Some potential donors will be scared of retribution. Some won’t be happy with their investment. Some will just be tired. Some will instead send their money to things like Trump’s inauguration party.”</p>
<p>“It’s not fun to contemplate death, I know.”</p>
<p>“AI systems do not need ledes, nut-graphs, or narrative flows; they need user-relevant, novel, and machine-readable content.”</p>
<p>“There is a single crisis in journalism, and from it all other problems emanate: money.”</p>
<p>“Ask someone in your life under 40 where they get the news. Odds are they’ll mention a non-newsroom podcaster or YouTuber.”</p>
<p>“The skills we developed while facing down the fossil fuel industry — persistence through trolling campaigns, converting readers one by one, turning an upstart publication into essential reading — these aren’t just about journalism. They’re about how to keep building when everything around you feels like it’s crumbling.”</p>
<p>“Factual accuracy is a necessary but insufficient goal of professional journalism. Journalists need to compile facts into a vision of reality that is more compelling than that offered by right-wing media and by Donald Trump.”</p>
