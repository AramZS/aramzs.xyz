<div>Vanity Fair and Olivia Nuzzi said they have agreed to part ways following   <a data-type="link" href="https://www.wsj.com/business/media/olivia-nuzzi-ryan-lizza-american-canto-substack-e1da8222?mod=article_inline">new revelations and allegations</a> about an affair with   <a data-type="link" href="https://www.wsj.com/business/media/claims-over-reporters-relationship-with-rfk-jr-surface-in-her-legal-feud-with-ex-ed1b2b0a?mod=article_inline">Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</a> and her behavior while reporting on him. </div><p></p>
<p>Nuzzi and the magazine said in a statement that they “mutually agreed, in the best interest of the magazine, to let her contract expire at the end of the year.”</p>
<div>Nuzzi wrote a profile of Kennedy in 2023, when she was New York magazine’s Washington correspondent. The magazine   <a data-type="link" href="https://www.wsj.com/business/media/new-york-magazine-olivia-nuzzi-part-ways-after-rfk-jr-relationship-f10ddc95?mod=article_inline">parted ways with her</a> in late 2024 after news of her relationship with Kennedy prompted an investigation into her work. </div><p></p>
<p>Her new book, titled “American Canto” and detailing her affair with an unnamed politician—along with a series of scathing Substack posts published in recent weeks by her ex-fiancé, longtime political journalist Ryan Lizza—have revived questions about her ethical conduct as a journalist.</p>
<p>Nuzzi signed on earlier this year as Vanity Fair’s West Coast editor. It was a short-term contract that expires at the end of the year, according to people familiar with its terms. The publication said at the time that she would be focusing on “events, industries, and culture of the Pacific region, as well as writing for the magazine.”</p>
<p>Lizza claimed in one of his Substack posts that Nuzzi had an affair with another politician besides Kennedy. In another, he included what he described as Kennedy’s explicit correspondences with Nuzzi, and said Nuzzi acted as a political operative for the then-candidate.</p>
<p>“American Canto” was published Tuesday. Ahead of the book’s release, Nuzzi landed a profile and photo shoot in the <a data-type="company" href="https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/NYT">New York Times</a> and a book excerpt in Vanity Fair.</p>
<p>Reviews of the book have been overwhelmingly negative.</p>
<p>The investigation into Nuzzi’s work at New York magazine, conducted by the law firm Davis Wright Tremaine, found “​​no inaccuracies nor evidence of bias.”</p>
