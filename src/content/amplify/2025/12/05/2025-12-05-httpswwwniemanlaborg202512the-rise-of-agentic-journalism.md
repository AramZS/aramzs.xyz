title: The rise of agentic journalism
---
<p>“AI systems do not need ledes, nut-graphs, or narrative flows; they need user-relevant, novel, and machine-readable content.”</p>
<p>In 2026, a new type of journalism will emerge: one tailored explicitly to machine compilers of language and information. This journalism will not be directed at people, but rather at chatbots and AI information summarizers. A journalism for the <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-13-8618-3_59">“agentic web”</a>: a web populated by automated agents that serve us, retrieving information, sharing our data, making our appointments, answering our emails. The agentic journalism.</p>
<p>Agentic journalism would break from our traditional article format. AI systems do not need ledes, nut-graphs, or narrative flows; they need user-relevant, novel, and machine-readable content. Maybe the format for agentic journalism will be a bulleted list or a JSON file — whatever it takes for that machine to ingest and reformat the content.</p>
<p>The role of the journalist in agentic journalism would be to add information about an event: the five Ws, quotes, context, and links to multimedia content. The writing itself, that fun exercise of putting together the puzzle pieces into a cogent reportage, wouldn’t even need to be automated by the news organization. It would be automated at the destination, pieced together by whatever format the end-user can extract from the machine they are using. In this type of journalism, editors focus on the accuracy and machine-readability of the information supplied by the reporter. The role of copy-editing (which we are already offloading to machine-assisted systems) would be even more diminished.</p>
<p>You might ask: What does this guy think about agentic journalism? Is he pitching it or warning us against it? Well, as a good academic in the social sciences, I’m not here to provide you with clear-cut answers. I’m here to, frustratingly, give you more questions. My prediction will stick to the historical perspectives and the techno-social forces that are in play.</p>
<p>Technology has always reshaped how journalism is produced, distributed, and consumed. The telegraph enabled the Associated Press; radio and television centralized news around financial powerhouses (state-backed or tightly regulated entities); the web offered unprecedented reach, and with it, the pressure of immediate audience feedback. With the rise of search engines and social media, journalists have written less for readers and more for algorithmic intermediaries: SEO-friendly content that is clearer, but less creative, and news articles planned according to their potential social media reach. The <a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2024/06/is-the-news-industry-ready-for-another-pivot-to-video/">great pivot to video</a> happened not because we found out our public preferred it, but because multimedia content was more attractive to digital platforms. These pressures are not just the audience making choices; it’s computers making choices for us. Journalism, then, adapts to these external <a href="https://danieltrielli.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/machine_editors_syllabus.pdf">machine editors</a>.</p>
<p>Now, audiences are <a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2025/06/ai-personalized-news-takes-new-forms-but-do-readers-want-it/">increasingly using AI-based products to get information</a>, both about their individual and public lives. <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08838151.2022.2162901">Some see AI tools as more approachable, less biased, and more tailored to their preferences</a>. For some people, this will lead to an increase in their exposure to news content. Publics who are tuned out of the news may find, in these novel and personalized ways of encountering this type of content, a newfound utility for journalism. For news organizations, the shift to agentic journalism could mean a new way to monetize content and aggregate value to their brand, by attracting attention and value to their output. To that end, journalists might start packaging stories with structured metadata (clear entity tags, event timestamps, source links, and standardized schemas) to make content legible to AI crawlers. The newsroom’s new craft could be less about prose and more about indexability.</p>
<p>On the other hand, surrendering to AI systems also means, once again, journalists relinquishing editorial control. Reporting and editing could be reduced to data entry. Journalism grows increasingly dependent on big tech’s shifting metrics of visibility and success. The profession risks becoming not a stand-alone public service but an appendage to the algorithmic meta-industry that shapes so many others. Even if you account for the increased reach of journalism, publication technologies are not, despite what big tech tries to sell, <a href="https://sonjadrimmer.com/blog-1/2025/9/10/the-printing-press-democratized-knowledge-a-slogans-masquerading-as-history">necessarily democratizing</a>. In fact, they are more often combined with increased concentration of capital and power to shape public agendas.</p>
<p>Technology is a trough we dig, but we also travel through: it channels but also constrains our movement. The technologies we end up choosing are neither inevitable nor the best possible future. The rise of agentic journalism, much like the rest of the agentic web, dehumanizes us a bit more. Will this type of journalism be a subset of a healthy news environment, or an inescapable economic reality? The answer depends on how much of an optimist you are.</p>

<p> <a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/collection/predictions-2026/"> <p>Each year, we ask some of the smartest people in digital media what they think is coming in the year ahead. Here's what they told us.</p> </a> </p>
<p>“Remember when we told journalists to write more explainers? Yeah, sorry about that.”</p>
<p>“News organizations will become loose confederations of news creators and supporting services.”</p>
<p>“In 2026, more news organizations will understand that people don’t always want an article. Sometimes they just want clarity.”</p>
<p>“If we tell readers, listeners and viewers that the sky is falling every day, we should not be surprised if they fail to react qualitatively differently if it really does fall one day.”</p>
<p>“Think of it as the Dominion Voting System strategy for journalism.”</p>
<p>“AI systems do not need ledes, nut-graphs, or narrative flows; they need user-relevant, novel, and machine-readable content.”</p>
<p>“We’re shifting from products designed to be ‘usable by everyone’ to products that are ‘customizable by everyone.'”</p>
<p>“In this critical moment where resources are scarce and journalists are desperate to offer deeper, more impactful content, 2026 must be the defining year for strategic mergers and radical resource sharing.”</p>
<p>“Early visibility creates more time, more time strengthens verification, better verification builds a clearer evidence trail, and that clarity improves trust. Instead of reacting to an announcement, a newsroom arrives with context already in place.”</p>
<p>“When discussing ways we can take information off the page, look to the theatre, or music, or crafting circles, or mutual aid groups, or any place where people gather for enjoyment, to explain differences and cultural needs.”</p>
<p>“Trolling was tricky enough to deal with when it existed around the edges of policy. Now it <em>is</em> policy.”</p>
<p>“The main reasons people aren’t more engaged with news are far more mundane than what the conventional wisdom suggests.”</p>
<p>“Despite the sometimes barely concealed vitriol poured out by some pundits over AI as information gateways, public AI adoption and attitudes paint a different picture.”</p>
<p>“For some people, there is real pleasure in checking out of the news.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps it’s time to look to organizations that have long been working at the margins as operating models in a more constrained future.”</p>
<p>“If your taxonomy labels everything simply as ‘video’ or ‘analysis,’ you’re rendering critical data points invisible.”</p>
<p>“Those who say LLMS are killing our traffic are focused on the wrong problem.”</p>
<p>“In 2026, the most pressing question will not be ‘What is true?’ but ‘Why is this story resonating right now and for whom?'”</p>
