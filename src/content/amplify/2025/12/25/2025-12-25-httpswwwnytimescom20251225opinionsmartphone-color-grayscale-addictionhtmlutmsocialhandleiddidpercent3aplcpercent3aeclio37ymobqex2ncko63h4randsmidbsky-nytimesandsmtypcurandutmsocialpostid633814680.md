<p><i><p><i>By </i><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/julia-angwin">Julia Angwin</a></p><blockquote><p>Ms. Angwin, a contributing Opinion writer, is an investigative journalist.</p></blockquote></i></p>
<p>I have long been skeptical of the current hysteria about how our phones are addictive machines destroying our previously pristine analog world. But a few months ago, even I began to be vaguely worried that I was devoting too many hours to an embarrassing medley of political commentary and makeup application TikTok videos. So when I spied an article about the benefits of switching one’s phone to a black-and-white color scheme, I figured I’d give it a whirl.</p>
<p>The result was shocking. The moment I switched, I no longer felt an urgent need to look at my iPhone — an urge that I hadn’t known was so strong until it was gone. I experienced a full- bodied sense of relief when the colors faded to gray.</p>
<p>An invisible cord had been severed. I would leave my phone in my room when I walked from my home office to the kitchen. I would forget to check it for hours instead of minutes. When I did check it, I put it down quickly as soon as the task was done. The number of hours I spent per day on the phone plummeted 40 percent, to an average of four hours and 40 minutes per day — still embarrassingly high, but not the vertiginous eight-plus hours I was averaging.</p>
<p>I am still not a subscriber to the current moral panic about phone dependency, an over-the-top overreaction that has led to ill-conceived laws <a href="https://www.kff.org/affordable-care-act/a-look-at-state-efforts-to-ban-cellphones-in-schools-and-implications-for-youth-mental-health/#:~:text=The%20bill%20includes%20exceptions%20for,implementation%20of%20school%20cellphone%20policies.">banning phones in school</a>, <a href="https://www.multistate.us/insider/2025/10/8/eight-states-enact-minor-social-media-bans-despite-court-fights">banning kids from social media</a>, <a href="https://action.freespeechcoalition.com/age-verification-resources/state-avs-laws/">requiring website visitors to prove their age</a> before accessing certain sites and even <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/news/eu-countries-reach-breakthrough-on-chat-scanning-law-despite-intense-pushback/">requiring scanning of text messages for illegal content</a>. I believe those laws are largely just dangerous restrictions on our freedom of speech and freedom of association clad in child-safety garb. But my adventures in greyscale have led me to the unfortunate conclusion that my own phone usage was a bit more compulsive than I had realized — and that we could all use a little help fighting our compulsions.</p>
<p>Scientists are increasingly embracing the concept called “<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/341544370_Antecedents_and_consequences_of_problematic_smartphone_use_A_systematic_literature_review_of_an_emerging_research_area">problematic smartphone use</a>,” which is defined as “the recurrent craving to use a smartphone in a way that is difficult to control and leads to impaired daily functioning,” in a <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/341544370_Antecedents_and_consequences_of_problematic_smartphone_use_A_systematic_literature_review_of_an_emerging_research_area">2020 analysis of hundreds</a> of papers on the topic.</p>
<p>And within this rubric, some describe problematic smartphone use as less an addiction and more like an obsessive compulsive behavior. Addicts are initially chasing pleasure; obsessive compulsives are chasing relief, <a href="https://aisel.aisnet.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1428&amp;context=amcis2012">researchers say</a>.</p>
<p>That resonated. For me, checking my phone is often a way to relieve my anxiety that perhaps there was a crisis I needed to jump on.</p>
<p>There are some small downsides to my black-and-white online life. Because the answer and decline buttons on my phone are both gray, I’ll sometimes hang up on a call I want to answer. Fortunately, these days, nobody minds if you just call them back. Games weren’t as fun, so I started playing them on my iPad and discovered that I liked the separation between work and play that it enforced: iPhone for boring stuff; iPad for fun. TikTok is weird on the iPad, so I still try to watch it on my phone occasionally, but in black and white it’s just not as compelling.</p>
<p>The hardest adjustment was photos. My husband sent me gray pictures of a beautiful sunset. My daughter texted me a selfie in her Halloween outfit dressed as a ladybug. She just looked odd and slightly goth until I checked on my computer and saw her decked out in red. Eventually, I figured out a <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/255214907#:~:text=Color%20filters%20shortcut%20*%20Go%20to%20iOS,turn%20the%20Grayscale%20filter%20on%20and%20off.">shortcut</a> that allows me to briefly switch to color by clicking the side button three times.</p>
<p>But I’ve found that whenever I return to color, even briefly, I am desperate to turn it off again as quickly as possible. With my eyes no longer accustomed to the brightness, I now find the phone’s colors to be too vivid, too blinding — kind of like I’m staring into a Times Square LED billboard.</p>
<p>Two and half months into this journey, my phone usage remains about four hours per day. And I’m pretty sure I’ll never go back to color on my phone.</p>
<p>It may sound cheesy, but to be honest, I feel like turning off color on my phone made me more aware and more appreciative of the color and beauty in real life. Now that I am no longer turning to my phone for fun, I find myself seeking it out in other ways — reading more books, watching more movies, planning more gatherings with friends, hanging out with my kids. And that’s something I do want to be addicted to.</p>
