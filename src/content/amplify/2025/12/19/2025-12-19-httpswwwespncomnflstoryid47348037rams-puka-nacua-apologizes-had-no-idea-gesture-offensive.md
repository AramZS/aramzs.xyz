<p>SEATTLE -- <a data-clubhouse-guid="2e1473b2-e269-fd7a-1137-c1edacb85986" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/lar/los-angeles-rams">Los Angeles Rams</a> wide receiver <a data-player-guid="05861488-1bb7-7c32-83eb-d0658a6e2b89" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4426515/puka-nacua">Puka Nacua</a> issued a statement Thursday apologizing for performing a gesture on an internet livestream that was "antisemitic in nature and perpetuated harmful stereotypes against Jewish people."</p>
<p>In the statement, Nacua said "at the time he had no idea" of the nature of the gesture, which has been associated with antisemitic themes.</p>
<p>"I deeply apologize to anyone who was offended by my actions as I do not stand for any form of racism, bigotry or hate of another group of people," Nacua wrote in the statement.</p>

<p>Nacua made the gesture on a livestream Tuesday with two internet streamers, Adin Ross and N3on, who suggested he perform the gesture as part of his next touchdown celebration.</p>
<p>The streamers attempted to enter the Rams' practice facility on Tuesday but were turned away by the team.</p>
<p>In the same livestream, he said NFL referees are "the worst," and said he thinks some refs make calls just to get on TV during games.</p>
