<p>When Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, false claims about “US-run biolabs” began circulating almost immediately through Russian state outlets. Within weeks, those same allegations had travelled far beyond diplomatic chambers in Geneva and New York, eventually appearing on one of America’s most-watched cable news programs, where Tucker Carlson repeated them to millions of viewers. By the time they reached this stage, the narratives appeared sudden and self-contained. But in fact, they were anything but: They had been seeded years earlier, refined through earlier propaganda campaigns, and systematically pushed through a multilayered state-backed disinformation ecosystem before entering mainstream Western discourse.</p>
<p>Disinformation is rapidly becoming a defining feature of contemporary geopolitics. It is not an incidental by-product of tension, or a collection of isolated fabrications circulating on the margins of public discourse. It has become a deliberate instrument of statecraft, and, in disarmament, it is deployed to manipulate diplomatic processes, weaken international treaties, corrode trust, and undermine cooperation. Yet the underlying architecture of these campaigns has long remained obscure, visible only in fleeting snapshots of individual allegations.</p>
<p>To illuminate this evolving terrain in chemical and biological disarmament, my team and I developed the <a href="https://gpwmdcounterdisinfo.com/cbrn-tracker/">Disinformation Tracker</a>, a systematic, open resource that documents narrative patterns, actors, and amplification pathways across multiple years and geopolitical contexts. The project is part of the WMD Counter Disinformation Initiative of the Global Partnership Against the Spread of Weapons and Materials of Mass Destruction. The goal of the tracker, and the broader initiative, is not to adjudicate every claim but to reveal the structure of the information environment: how narratives emerge, migrate, recycle and escalate.</p>
<p>To build the tracker, we systematically searched the archives and websites of key multilateral disarmament fora—including the UN General Assembly, the Security Council, and the Chemical and Biological Weapons Conventions—alongside selected government repositories from states frequently implicated in chemical-biological weapons allegations, such as China, Russia, Syria, Ukraine, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The chemical weapons disinformation dataset spans 2011–2025, beginning with the Syrian civil war; the biological dataset covers 2015–2025, the period in which state-sponsored biological narratives became particularly prominent. Each entry was assessed for provenance and context, coded chronologically by source, forum, and narrative type and cross-checked for consistency.</p>

<p>While practical constraints—such as prioritizing reliable English-language materials—introduced some limits, the approach provided a structured and impartial foundation for understanding how chemical-biological weapons allegations emerge, evolve, and shape multilateral disarmament debates.</p>
<p><strong>An organi</strong><strong>zed campaign. </strong>Across the dataset, one pattern is unmistakable. Russian state organs and affiliated channels play a central role in generating, amplifying, and sustaining disinformation narratives. What the tracker adds is a longitudinal view—showing that many narratives now dominating diplomatic debates have existed in earlier forms for years, sometimes for more than a decade.</p>
<p>The Lugar Center in Tbilisi, Georgia, is a case in point. For over 10 years, Russian state media, defense officials, and select commentators have levelled allegations of covert biological-weapons development at the facility. When I wrote in the <em>Bulletin</em> in 2018 about the <a href="https://thebulletin.org/2018/11/the-russian-disinformation-attack-that-poses-a-biological-danger/">dangers</a> posed by this campaign, it was already clear that the allegations were not simple misunderstandings but deliberate misrepresentations—claims of secret experiments, selective use of technical documents, insinuations about pathogen release and military intent. These narratives persisted despite repeated clarifications from Georgian public health authorities, Georgian diplomats, and international partners, as well as comprehensive scrutiny by journalists.</p>
<p>With the perspective provided by the tracker, it becomes clear that Georgia was not an isolated case but the prototype for a more ambitious effort. The rhetorical devices used against the Lugar Center—pseudo-expert testimony, emotionally charged imagery, the appropriation of scientific terminology—reappeared almost verbatim in later campaigns.</p>
<p>A clearer pattern also emerges from the tracker’s longitudinal view. Russian chemical-biological weapons disinformation relies on a network of state institutions, state-aligned media, proxy outlets and local validators who recycle, legitimize, and disseminate narratives into the international information space. The structure operates from the core outward: Bodies such as the Russian Ministry of Defence and Ministry of Foreign Affairs originate the allegations; state media amplify and elaborate them; diplomats push them in international security fora. This progression, visible as a clear chronological pattern in the tracker, shows how Russia tested, refined, and normalized chemical-biological weapons disinformation techniques long before they were deployed at scale.</p>
<p>Those techniques moved to centre stage with Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Within days of the invasion, familiar claims resurfaced: accusations that Ukraine, with US support, was running covert bioweapons programs; assertions that routine biosurveillance work constituted illicit military activity; insinuations about pathogen manipulation for offensive purposes. The volume was unprecedented. The tracker maps a dramatic surge across Defence Ministry briefings, state media, and international statements, notes verbales, and other diplomatic documentation.</p>
<p>What set the Ukraine disinformation campaign apart was not just its intensity but its reach into formal diplomacy. Russia brought its allegations repeatedly to the UN Security Council and the Biological Weapons Convention. It submitted <a href="https://thebulletin.org/2022/07/russia-finds-another-stage-for-the-ukraine-biolabs-disinformation-show/">Article V</a> and <a href="https://thebulletin.org/2022/11/russia-again-peddles-its-debunked-us-ukrainian-bioweapons-claims-at-the-united-nations/">Article VI</a> complaints to the convention triggering formal processes to address them that involved Russia staging elaborate presentations purporting to demonstrate US-Ukrainian bioweapons collaboration. UN meeting transcripts, publicly available through the UN document system, record these efforts in detail. They also capture the responses of UN disarmament officials, who stated clearly that the UN had no information supporting the claims.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the very act of raising these allegations in multilateral fora altered the diplomatic landscape. Many delegations, particularly from non-aligned states—countries that position themselves outside major power blocs and seek to maintain neutrality in great-power disputes—were deeply uneasy with the politicization of the bioweapons convention but were also reluctant to appear partisan by forcefully rejecting Russia’s assertions. As a result, substantive work on strengthening the treaty was repeatedly overshadowed by debates over unverifiable and unsupported accusations. The broader cooperative biological threat reduction efforts of the 31-member Global Partnership (of which Ukraine and the United States are both members) were also impacted. In earlier <em>Bulletin</em> pieces, I warned that such <a href="https://thebulletin.org/2022/03/dont-let-finger-pointing-doom-this-key-treaty-against-bioweapons/">finger-pointing</a> risked paralyzing the bioweapons convention; the tracker now provides empirical evidence showing how swiftly and systematically these narratives escalated.</p>
<p><strong>The difficulty of dislodging falsehoods. </strong>Understanding why the false narratives endure is essential for developing effective responses. Chemical and biological security policy is technically complex and opaque to much of the public. Cooperative threat-reduction programs, such as the disease surveillance programs in Eastern Europe set up in partnership with the US military, while vital for global health security, often involve sensitive information, creating opportunities for adversarial misrepresentation. There is also a deep asymmetry at play: Fabricating an allegation is easy, but disproving it requires scientific expertise, documentation, and international coordination. That can be particularly challenging in the oft-ambiguous environments of chemical-biological security. Even when claims are conclusively debunked, residual doubt can persist.</p>
<p>These dynamics pose significant risks. Sustained allegations erode confidence in laboratories and public-health systems. They undermine international scientific collaboration, and they place undue pressure on institutions already tasked with responding to outbreaks and emergencies. They introduce friction into diplomatic processes, diverting time and political capital away from strengthening global security architectures. And they weaken operational readiness by reducing public and political trust in biosurveillance systems that are critical for early detection of emerging threats.</p>
<p>By tracing narrative evolution rather than reacting to individual claims, the tracker shows that chemical-biological disinformation is not random, but structured, sustained, and strategically deployed. This clarity matters. Policymakers can identify emerging patterns earlier. Journalists can contextualize claims within broader cycles rather than treating them as novel developments. Diplomats can rely on neutral, evidence-based mapping to guide discussions in contentious fora. And scientific institutions can anticipate how their work might be misrepresented before disinformation takes root.</p>
<p><strong>Building resilience</strong><strong>. </strong>Looking ahead, the pressures driving disinformation are unlikely to diminish. Expanding capabilities in synthetic biology, genomics, and related biotechnologies, alongside growing laboratory networks, geopolitical competition, and accelerating information flows, all create fertile ground for manipulation. Strengthening resilience will require more than improved fact-checking. It demands transparency from laboratories and public-health institutions, coordinated communication strategies, and a willingness among states to call out deliberate disinformation swiftly and jointly. It also requires investments in shared tools that allow governments, researchers, and civil society organizations to monitor the information environment collectively rather than in isolation.</p>
<p>If the international community is to preserve and strengthen the institutions that safeguard against high-consequence risks, it must first understand how those institutions are being targeted. The tracker offers one contribution toward that goal.</p>
