title: Journalism will ask better questions and listen to different answers

<p> <a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/collection/predictions-2026/">   Predictions for Journalism 2026  </a> </p>
<p>“Journalism isn’t listening to people, and they are tired of waiting.”</p>
<p>-ournalism-will-ask-better-questions-and-listen-to</p>
<p>Who are you listening to? What did you learn? Why is it important to the person who is reading this? Why are you even here?</p>
<p>My biggest prediction for 2026 is journalism needs to answer these (among other) questions. In public. <em>With</em> the people they use as subjects and claim as audience.</p>
<p>Journalism isn’t listening to people, and they are tired of waiting. We are in a post-pandemic, post-Twitter world, where it feels like entire sections of our lives have been memory-holed and 2024 and 2025 blur into a post-reelection haze, trying to sift through the tumult of modern times, after record layoffs, constant conflict, and deciphering AI. Rank racism is now debated and <a href="https://www.washingtoninformer.com/black-women-jobs-loss-april/">obvious discrimination is overlooked</a>, even if <a href="https://opennews.org/projects/2020-leavers-survey/">the trend started in journalism</a>.</p>
<p>Saving journalism (and quite possible free speech) in America should be a project of archiving, listening, and context-shaping. But journalism has developed a solipsism, possibly shame, possibly in self-righteousness, but entirely off-putting to our audience, and more concerned with useful dehumanization and brand-building than actual informing.</p>
<p>People want context, sense-making, and coverage that reflects the reality of their lives. Local news is seeing its work recycled by “creators” whose entire hook is attacking “mainstream media.” Subject-matter experts and community builders are building large platforms overnight simply because they are showing up, with context for the people around them and the people they want to reach.</p>
<p>What journalism used to do.</p>
<p>I am using examples linked to my experience as a Black woman in journalism, but the feeling of a huge gap between what journalism talks about and how is felt across demographics.</p>
<p>When mainstream stories about Haitians, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/13/us/politics/biden-trump-haitian-immigrants-cats-dogs.html">targeted by an untrue racist smear campaign</a>, barely feature quotes from the targets and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9DDoxtl43k">only link to the community focused newspaper</a> when it becomes a target itself, how can people believe in journalism’s discernment and solidarity of itself, let alone its audience? And while those stories are from 2024, they are also from <a href="https://haitiantimes.com/2020/01/21/immigration-advocates-look-to-reverse-deportation-of-haitian-community-activist-jean-montrevil/">2020</a>.</p>
<p>Journalism has mastered the art of triangulation, using persecution or crisis to duck responsibility. Claiming that they are needed to “speak truth to power” when in reality they serve more as power’s voice box and barely speak to anyone else. Over and over, questions about why the people <a href="https://www.cjr.org/the_media_today/researchers_under_attack_disinformation.php">who are supposed to be experts</a> do not include the realities of communities whose targeting was a fundamental part of this moment. Instead, while giving multiple interviews to their attackers admitting to manipulation using <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/07/opinion/chris-rufo-trump-anti-dei-education.html">falsehoods and media compliance</a>, journalism retreats on every promise it made <a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2025/09/from-reckoning-to-retreat-newsrooms-dei-efforts-are-in-decline/">about equity, let along repair and acknowledgement.</a></p>
<p>People don’t have time for that. They’re no longer willing to accept failures of exclusion, condescension, and lack of context journalism claimed were “objectivity.” They are starting to ask the questions of themselves that journalism has avoided. They want to listen, they want to learn, and what is important to them are the people around them and those who will help them.</p>
<p>Hyperlocals like <a href="https://lataco.com">L.A. Taco</a> and <a href="https://blockclubchicago.org/">Block Club Chicago</a> are taking up the slack of large papers to become national if not international leaders. Ethics conversations leave the voices of immigrants completely <a href="https://margaretsullivan.substack.com/p/three-ugly-lessons-in-unethical-media">unlinked and left out</a>. Meanwhile, communities are braving tear gas and <a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/2025/11/17/ice-whistles-immigration-nyc-chicago-dhs/">organizing trainings to protect them</a>. “Unelectable” candidates from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/04/nyregion/nyc-mayor-mamdani-elected.html">New York</a> to Georgia, dismissed from poor sample sizes, are making history by talking directly to people about issues. We can lament how much people, especially <a href="https://www.the74million.org/article/can-gen-z-save-journalism-only-if-theyre-taught-how-to-trust-again/">younger generations</a>, don’t trust us, but until we acknowledge that our own actions have led us here, we will never truly shift.</p>
<p>The fate of journalism has always been about a series of choices and priorities. My last prediction for Nieman Lab was that <a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2017/12/listen-to-your-corner-and-watch-for-the-hook/">journalism was in the middle of a boxing match it hadn’t fully acknowledged, let alone begun to fight</a>, utterly unprepared for how badly things would go.</p>
<p>I was right. <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/listening-to-black-women-the-innovation-tech-cant-figure-out/">I didn’t want to be</a>. Rather than respect or repair, I and many others were converted to content for other people’s “data.” Failed promises of respect, repair, and real equity were unfulfilled and brushed aside. It may have cost us the entire industry of journalism as we know it. I do not have time or resources to mourn that loss, and I am not sure I would if I did.</p>
<p>I am sure that the people who are showing up to do good anyway are the reason I am willing to keep going for whatever’s next. I am a founding member of a knowledge mutual-aid project called <a href="http://unbreaking.org">unbreaking.org</a>. We went from seven people to over 100 dedicated to making sense of the changes of the administration. Over and over we hear that “someone should be keeping track of this,” so an amazing group of people are trying to manage the work of doing just that. We are not alone. We track other projects traditional and new, but curated with care, that make it a mission to listen.</p>
<p>My prediction is that people truly willing to answer my questions — who can tell me, the public, but most importantly themselves — get to define what’s next, for good or for ill. The people who refuse don’t deserve to.</p>
