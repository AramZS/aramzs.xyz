<p><a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/newmusicoldmusic/p/the-year-in-music?utm_campaign=post-expanded-share&amp;utm_medium=web">Album-of-the-year lists are nice</a>. Useful, educational, fun to cross-reference!</p>
<p>But mixtapes (AKA curated playlists), at their best, speak to my soul, and help me hear songs in different ways: illuminating melodic and timbral kinships, mirroring shared themes, surprising me with songs I might’ve heard, loved, then forgot in the 24/7 hydrant-flow of digital media. Making the case that maybe I <em><strong>should</strong></em> spring for that vinyl copy, or get out to see the band live.</p>
<p>I <em><strong>love </strong></em>making and listening to mixtapes. <em><a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/165496/love-is-a-mix-tape-by-rob-sheffield/">Love is a Mixtape</a></em>, by my colleague Rob Sheffield, is a beautiful memoir that captures the magic as well as anyone has, and likely ever will. I have a good friend from college who has been sending me mixes for decades, and is a master of the form (here’s a rando I pulled off my shelf):</p>

<p>Ron’s handmade mixes have always been a touchstone for the ones I make here — for how the songs speak to each other, to the moment, and to our shared histories.</p>
<p>AI mixes will never come close.</p>
<p>So: here you go, a Best-of-2025 mix — 150+ songs deep — that distills playlists I’ve posted this year, spiked with gems I missed along the way. As always, I labored over segueways, and I trust there are some tasty ones. (NB: <a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/newmusicoldmusic/p/the-50-best-covers-of-2025?utm_campaign=post-expanded-share&amp;utm_medium=web">my mixtape of 2025’s best covers</a> from last month.)</p>
<p>Enjoy the playlist(s) below, and <em><strong>HUGE</strong></em> thanks for the support this year, which keeps this newsletter alive. Happy holidays to you and yours, and here’s to a hopeful 2026.</p>
<p>Footnotes on songs/ things we loved in 2025:</p>
<p>— The return of the rock’n’roll bass drop (aka: that Pixies/Nirvana soft-loud thing): see Turnstile’s “Never Enough” (01:09), Geese’s “Taxes” (01:32), etc.</p>
<p>— Psychedelic light shows, various (see photo up top)</p>
<p>— UK rap, which, <a href="https://www.vibe.com/news/entertainment/drake-uk-rappers-better-lyricists-american-rapper-1235085741/">Drake’s takes notwithstanding</a>, was very hot this year: Lil Simz, Obongjayar, Dave, and Jim Legxacy made records that will endure.</p>
