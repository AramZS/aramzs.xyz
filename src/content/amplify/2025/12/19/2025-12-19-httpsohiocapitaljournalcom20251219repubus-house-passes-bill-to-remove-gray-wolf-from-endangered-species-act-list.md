<p>The U.S. House on Thursday passed, <a href="https://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll360.xml">211-204</a>, a bill to remove Endangered Species Act protections for the gray wolf outside Alaska.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/845/text">bill</a>, sponsored by Colorado Republican Lauren Boebert, would direct the Interior secretary to reissue a 2020 rule removing ESA protections that delisted wolves other than the Mexican wolf in the lower 48 states, while stipulating it could not be challenged in court.</p>
<p>The rule from President Donald Trump’s first administration was struck down by a federal court in 2022.</p>
<p>Five Democrats voted for the bill and four Republicans voted against it. The measure was considered during the chamber’s last vote series before a two-week break, and 18 members did not vote.</p>
<p>Sen. Ron Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican, has sponsored <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/senate-bill/1306">a companion bill </a>in that chamber. The measure faces an uphill road in the Senate, where passage of partisan bills is rarer due to the 60-vote threshold for most legislation.</p>
<p>The bill would remove gray wolves from the ESA list, even though they have not reached population figures that the Fish and Wildlife Service has said would indicate full recovery.</p>
<p>Rep. Donald S. Beyer, a Democrat from Virginia, said it would be reasonable to adjust population thresholds, but that congressionally mandated delisting was unwise and illegal.</p>
<p>“This bill fails to recognize the status of gray wolves today, taking us back to an outdated rulemaking that didn’t hold up in court,” Beyer said on the House floor Thursday.</p>
<p>House Natural Resources Committee ranking Democrat Jared Huffman of California said the bill set a “troubling” precedent by blocking judicial review.</p>
<p>“It tells the American people they no longer have the right to challenge unlawful government actions,” he said. “The ESA is simple and effective. It ensures decisions are grounded in science — that’s the heart of it — and this bill throws that principle out the window.”</p>
<p>Several Republicans on the Natural Resources Committee spoke in favor of the bill, saying it would delegate wolf management to states.</p>
<p>In a statement, Natural Resources Chairman Bruce Westerman, an Arkansas Republican, said the gray wolf has been “fully recovered” for two decades.</p>
<p>“States are more than capable of managing thriving wolf populations. This legislation restores a common-sense, science-based approach to wolf management, returning decision-making to states,” he said.</p>
<p>Republicans also argued the bill would protect livestock and humans.</p>
<p>Rep. Pete Stauber showed a photo from his district in Ely, Minnesota, of a wolf in a school parking lot.</p>
<p>“Because of the gray wolf’s listing status, nothing could be done to protect the lives of the students there,” the Republican said. “The broken ESA is putting my constituents’ lives at risk.”</p>
