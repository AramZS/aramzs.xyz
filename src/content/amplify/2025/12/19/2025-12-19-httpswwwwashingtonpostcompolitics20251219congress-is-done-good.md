It overhauled Medicaid and other social safety nets by creating work requirements and getting rid of loopholes that allowed states to receive more funding for rural hospitals. It included $170 billion for stronger border and immigration enforcement, over $24 billion for a “Golden Dome” missile<b> </b>defense system and cuts to Biden-era clean energy tax credits. It created new investment accounts for children born during Trump’s second term and helped family farmers save on inheritance taxes for their properties.</p><p class="rw-outer-content"><span>Some content could not be imported from the original document.</span> <a href="https://washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/12/19/congress-is-done-good/">View content ↗ </a></p><p>“It really covers everything,” Trump said at a Tokyo business forum in October. “I said, ‘Put it all into one bill, and if we get it done, we’re done for four years.’ We don’t need anything more from Congress in terms of that.”</p><p>So what’s next? Is the Republican-controlled Congress dismissed forever?</p><p>This White House has shown a much greater willingness than past administrations to operate without Congress. The White House circumvented Congress to cut billions of dollars in funding for federal government programs, putting into question the Legislative Branch’s constitutional power of the purse. Trump went ahead with lethal action against Venezuelan boats and ships as part of his offense against drug cartels, bypassing the Congress’s role in authorizing the president’s war powers. Yesterday, White House press secretary <b>Karoline Leavitt</b> announced that the Kennedy Center board voted to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/2025/12/18/kennedy-center-renamed-trump/" target="_blank">rename the performing arts institution the Trump-Kennedy Center</a>, even though Congress has authority over its name.</p><p>When the 43-day shutdown froze the federal government, Trump took weeks to push Congress to find a solution to fund the government. House Speaker <b>Mike Johnson</b> (R-Louisiana) kept the House out of town the entire time, in a move Democrats said was to prevent any uncomfortable votes that could challenge the president.</p><p>And Trump seemed tepid on the idea of using the budget reconciliation process — the legislative maneuver that allows Republicans to take advantage of their majorities and bypass the Senate filibuster — again in 2026 to pass legislation addressing the high cost of health care.</p><p>But don’t expect Congress to be a quiet place next year. Some of the most dramatic battles of 2025 could find fresh fodder in the new year.</p><p>Moderate Republicans and Democrats are keeping the covid-era Affordable Care Act subsidies front and center. Four moderate Republicans joined all Democrats in signing a discharge petition — a legislative mechanism to overrule the speaker and force bills to the floor — this week on a bill that would extend the subsidies by three years.</p><p>Johnson will have to have a vote on the floor in the new year. It’s not likely to go anywhere beyond the House — Senate Republicans already rejected a similar provision this month. But the floor vote will let vulnerable Republicans vote for the measure going into the midterms as the high cost of health care remains a key issue.</p><p>House Minority Leader <b>Hakeem Jeffries</b> (D-New York), joined with his caucus on the House steps hours before the chamber’s last vote of the year, and urged Johnson to bring a bill extending the subsidies to the floor for a vote immediately.</p><p>“Republicans have had all year to address this health care situation, but they’ve been too busy trying to jam their extreme agenda down the throats of the American people,” Jeffries told reporters. “The most important thing that the Congress should be doing is driving down the high cost of living to make life more affordable for everyday Americans.”</p><p>Government funding expires at the end of January, meaning Democrats have another leverage point to potentially shut down the government to force a vote on the health care subsidies. The party isn’t ruling out the option.</p><p>Another issue that could gain traction in the new year is Trump’s strikes on Venezuelan ships. Members of both parties have <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/12/09/congressional-republicans-venezuela-strikes/" target="_blank">expressed concern </a>over the administration’s strikes on alleged drug trafficking ships in the Caribbean and talk of potential regime change in the country. A vote to require more congressional approval for continued strikes <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/12/17/venezuela-congress-trump-war-powers/b629ad70-db8e-11f0-b484-4459fa8e79e5_story.html" target="_blank">failed in the House this week</a>, but the angst from many members remains.</p><p>Then there’s the <b>Jeffrey Epstein</b> drama (which we discuss more later). The House Oversight Committee is continuing its investigation into the estate of the convicted sex offender, and you can expect some pointed responses to the Justice Department’s enormous trove of files on Epstein that is expected to be made public today.</p><p>Still, Congress will be missing the major targets of 2025, particularly as members look to a unique midterm year in which Republicans are facing an uphill battle to hold on to their majority and redistricting is scrambling races much earlier than anticipated. Our House gurus, <b>Marianna Sotomayor </b>and <b>Kadia Goba</b>, report that the dynamic is <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/12/18/mike-johnson-control-house/" target="_blank">leaving some Republican members frustrated with Johnson’s leadership</a>.</p><p>When Johnson was asked this week by a reporter (Early Brief author emerita <b>Leigh Ann Caldwell</b>) why voters should support Republicans if Trump says the party’s legislative agenda is finished, the speaker said work remains to bring down costs and codify the president’s executive orders.</p><p>“We’re going to have a very aggressive legislative agenda coming right out of the gates in January,” Johnson said. “You’re going to see an aggressive affordability agenda, and we’re going to see continued codification of the president’s executive orders. He’s up to about 200 of those, probably about 150 of them are codifiable by Congress, and we’re working steadily through that list you’re going to see us delivering for the American people.”</p><h2>Get ready with The Post</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/12/18/stephen-miller-boat-strikes-mexico-venezuela-execute-order/" target="_blank">Stephen Miller’s hard-line Mexico strategy morphed into deadly boat strikes</a>, from <b>Ellen Nakashima</b>, <b>Alex Horton</b> and <b>Dan Lamothe</b>.</li><li><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/12/18/boat-strike-survivors-congress-inquiries/" target="_blank">GOP signals end to probes into military’s killing of boat strike survivors</a>, from <b>Noah Robertson</b>.</li><li><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/12/19/donald-trump-pardons-trevor-milton-nikola/" target="_blank">Trump’s pardons wipe out payments to defrauded victims</a>, from <b>Beth Reinhard</b> and <b>Aaron Schaffer</b>.</li><li><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/interactive/2025/ukraine-children-missile-kryvyi-rih/" target="_blank">A Russian missile, filled with U.S. tech, rips a Ukrainian boy’s life apart</a>, from <b>Lizzie Johnson</b>, <b>Kostiantyn Khudov</b>, <b>Anastacia Galouchka</b>, <b>Serhiy Morgunov</b> and <b>Carolyn Van Houten</b>.</li><li><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/12/18/trump-expands-marijuana-cbd-access/" target="_blank">Trump orders expanded access to marijuana, CBD, citing medical benefits</a>, from <b>Dan Diamond</b>, <b>David Ovalle</b> and <b>Jacob Bogage</b>.</li><li><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/12/18/trump-military-housing-warrior-dividend/" target="_blank">Trump will use military housing money for $1,776 Pentagon bonuses</a>, from <b>Jacob Bogage</b>, <b>Noah Robertson</b> and <b>Riley Beggin</b>.</li><li><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/12/18/coast-guard-swastikas-nooses-kristi-noem/" target="_blank">Coast Guard policy on swastikas, nooses will be revised, Noem says</a>, from <b>Tara Copp</b> and <b>Marianne LeVine</b>.</li></ul><h2>What we’re watching</h2><p>Today is the deadline for the Justice Department to release the remainder of its files on the late <b>Jeffrey Epstein</b>. Congress passed legislation in November requiring the Trump administration to make public all of its records on the convicted sex offender. The Justice Department had a month to redact details that could put any ongoing investigations at risk or expose victims’ personal information.</p><p>We don’t know what’s going to be in the files or how extensive the release will be. The clause allowing the administration to withhold information impacting ongoing investigations gives the administration the leeway to decide what’s fair game. The law does require the Justice Department to report what it redacted.</p><p>But expect the release to be expansive, including perhaps hundreds of thousands of pages from years of investigations. A federal judge said earlier this month that the release could also include secret grand jury transcripts.</p><p>The tranche set to be public today is separate from the files from Epstein’s estate, which the House Oversight Committee has been slowly releasing this year.</p><h2>In the campaign</h2><p>The Democratic National Committee <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/12/18/democrats-2024-harris-trump-autopsy/" target="_blank">will not publicly release its autopsy of the 2024 presidential campaign,</a> party officials told us, a reversal of the plan to release the document, which was meant to reckon with the party’s failure last year.</p><p>By declining to release the report, party officials hope to avoid the fiery internal debates that consumed the party after <b>Kamala Harris</b>’s loss to Trump, when Democrats are eager to celebrate a string of 2025 wins and focus on the 2026 midterms, the officials said.</p><p><b>Ken Martin</b>, the chair of the Democratic National Committee, put it this way: “Here’s our North Star: Does this help us win? If the answer is no, it’s a distraction from the core mission.”</p><p>But the party <i>did</i> say<i> </i>it planned to release the report, so declining to do so has raised questions about its contents and sparked backlash from party operatives who fear the party is simply seeking to avoid accountability.</p><p>“A handful of wins is not the same as the rehabilitation of the Democratic brand, which is required to build real governing majorities and a national coalition,” said <b>Alyssa Cass,</b> a Democratic operative in New York. “Achieving that requires real soul-searching and new ideas, and it would be nice for candidates and campaigns to know they had a partner in that hard work, instead of an institutional structure buried in the sand.”</p><h2>In your local paper</h2><p><b>Texas Monthly:</b> There’s a saying that Texas isn’t a red state but a nonvoting state. Jasmine Crockett is counting on it being true. <a href="https://www.texasmonthly.com/news-politics/texas-democrats-midterm-elections-blue-state/" target="_blank">But is it</a>?</p><p><b>CalMatters (California):</b> CARE (Community Assistance, Recovery, and Empowerment) Court is a state program meant to help people with severe untreated mental illnesses and get them off the streets. <a href="https://calmatters.org/housing/homelessness/2025/12/care-court-homeless/" target="_blank">It’s track record so far appears spotty.</a></p><p><b>Portland Press Herald (Maine):</b> Inside Graham Platner’s winding, often contradictory and controversial <a href="https://www.pressherald.com/2025/12/18/how-graham-platners-complicated-past-shapes-his-run-for-u-s-senate/" target="_blank">road to disillusionment with Washington — and running for Senate</a>.</p><h2>Send us a reply</h2><p>Let us know what you’re most looking forward to in the new year!
