<p>If there’s been one good thing to come out of the U.S.’ ridiculous mistreatment of Canada this year, it’s the greater call to support Canadians. From <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2025/02/10/edmonton-made-app-helps-you-shop-canadian-made-products/">a widespread push to “buy Canadian”</a> to <a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/trumps-tariffs/article/we-stand-with-canada-americans-who-live-here-show-solidarity-amid-trumps-threats/">much-appreciated messages of support from Americans who <em>don’t</em> support their awful government</a>, it’s been truly wonderful to see more people step up and speak out.</p>
<p>At <em>MobileSyrup</em>, we’ve always promoted Canadian companies, artists and productions, but that feels all the more important lately. <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2024/01/06/canadian-video-game-industry-deserves-more-recognition-editorial/">Canadians often don’t get the recognition they deserve</a> to begin with, and that was even before our once closest ally launched the one-two punch of unprovoked attacks on our sovereignty and senseless trade wars. But at the risk of what really matters getting lost amid all of that noise, Canada does indeed have so many amazing creators <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2025/06/02/canadian-gaming-industry-lack-of-recognition-greater-support/">to celebrate and support</a>, and arguably the best example of that is <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2025/01/28/canadian-video-game-industry-2024-economic-impact-report/">our world-class $5.1 billion video game industry.</a></p>
<p>While this year was perhaps quieter in terms of higher-profile releases, both<a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2024/12/19/mobilesyrup-top-10-games-of-2024-final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-metaphor-refantazio-1000xresist/"> as a whole</a> and for <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2024/12/27/canadian-developers-2024-games-balatro-1000xresist-lil-guardsman-dragon-age-warframe/">Canadian titles</a>, our national game makers still put out plenty of exceptional experiences. A stunning gothic tribute to Black community and culture. A glorious retro-inspired Marvel beat ’em up. An inventive twist on a 45-year-old Atari classic.</p>
<p>Across the board, there was a huge variety of 2025 games from Canadian developers. Here are some of the standouts.</p>
<h2>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</h2>
<figure><img alt="Assassin's Creed Shadows Naoe stealth" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" src="https://production-static.mobilesyrup.com/uploads/2025/03/ac-shadows-naoe.jpg" srcset="https://production-static.mobilesyrup.com/uploads/2025/03/ac-shadows-naoe.jpg 1920w, https://production-static.mobilesyrup.com/uploads/2025/03/ac-shadows-naoe-300x169.jpg 300w, https://production-static.mobilesyrup.com/uploads/2025/03/ac-shadows-naoe-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://production-static.mobilesyrup.com/uploads/2025/03/ac-shadows-naoe-768x432.jpg 768w, https://production-static.mobilesyrup.com/uploads/2025/03/ac-shadows-naoe-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://production-static.mobilesyrup.com/uploads/2025/03/ac-shadows-naoe-417x235.jpg 417w"/><figcaption>Image credit: Ubisoft</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Developer:</strong> Ubisoft Quebec (Quebec City, Que.)<strong><br/>
 Publisher:</strong> Ubisoft<br/>
<strong>Genre:</strong> Action-adventure, open-world<br/>
<strong>Platforms:</strong> PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch 2, PC, and Amazon Luna</p>
<p>After delivering one of the most popular <em>Assassin’s Creed </em>games in 2018’s <em>Odyssey</em>, <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2025/03/25/assassins-creed-shadows-ubisoft-quebec-launch-interview/">Ubisoft Quebec</a> gave the series its long-awaited 16th century Japan entry. <em>Shadows </em>tells the interlocking stories of Naoe, the shinobi daughter of an Assassin, and Yasuke, an African samurai based on the historical figure of the same name. With this dual-protagonist setup, players can explore <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2025/02/20/ubisoft-quebec-assassins-creed-shadows-behind-the-scenes/">the stunning and geographically diverse Kansai region</a> using Naoe’s savvy stealth abilities or Yasuke’s brute strength. Best of all, Ubisoft has <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/assassins-creed/news/7xrzBsElcQq2dubHcOdGz3/ac-shadows-title-update-117-release-notes">continued to support the game with meaningful updates</a>, from the <em>Claws of Awaji</em> narrative expansion to quality-of-life tweaks like improved parkour and new finisher animations.</p>
<h2>Ambrosia Sky: Act One</h2>
<figure><img alt="Ambrosia Sky Act One cleaning" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" src="https://production-static.mobilesyrup.com/uploads/2025/12/ambrosia-sky-act-one.jpg" srcset="https://production-static.mobilesyrup.com/uploads/2025/12/ambrosia-sky-act-one.jpg 1920w, https://production-static.mobilesyrup.com/uploads/2025/12/ambrosia-sky-act-one-300x169.jpg 300w, https://production-static.mobilesyrup.com/uploads/2025/12/ambrosia-sky-act-one-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://production-static.mobilesyrup.com/uploads/2025/12/ambrosia-sky-act-one-768x432.jpg 768w, https://production-static.mobilesyrup.com/uploads/2025/12/ambrosia-sky-act-one-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://production-static.mobilesyrup.com/uploads/2025/12/ambrosia-sky-act-one-417x235.jpg 417w"/><figcaption>Image credit: Soft Rains</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Developer/publisher:</strong> Soft Rains (Toronto, Ont.)<br/>
<strong>Genre: </strong>Immersive sim<br/>
<strong>Platforms:</strong> PC</p>
<p>One of the most original games on this list comes from <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2025/06/11/toronto-soft-rains-ambrosia-sky-summer-game-fest-preview/">a new team made up of former developers from the likes of Bethesda and Ubisoft</a>. In <em>Ambrosia Sky</em>, you play as Dalia, a woman tasked with exploring an asteroid colony to search through the remnants of human life. It’s a surprisingly touching exploration of life and death that features a clever mix of <em>Metroid Prime</em>-esque haunting atmosphere and satisfying <em>PowerWash Simulator</em>-like water-based cleaning mechanics. <i>Ambrosia Sky </i>is off to a promising start in Act One, and we can’t wait to see where it goes in its next two acts.</p>
<h2>Elsewhere Electric</h2>
<figure><img alt="Elsewhere Electric" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" src="https://production-static.mobilesyrup.com/uploads/2025/12/elsewhere-electric.jpg" srcset="https://production-static.mobilesyrup.com/uploads/2025/12/elsewhere-electric.jpg 1920w, https://production-static.mobilesyrup.com/uploads/2025/12/elsewhere-electric-300x169.jpg 300w, https://production-static.mobilesyrup.com/uploads/2025/12/elsewhere-electric-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://production-static.mobilesyrup.com/uploads/2025/12/elsewhere-electric-768x432.jpg 768w, https://production-static.mobilesyrup.com/uploads/2025/12/elsewhere-electric-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://production-static.mobilesyrup.com/uploads/2025/12/elsewhere-electric-417x235.jpg 417w"/><figcaption>Image credit: Games by Stitch</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Developer/publisher:</strong> Games by Stitch (Toronto, Ont.)<br/>
<strong>Genre: </strong>Puzzle, co-op<br/>
<strong>Platforms:</strong> Meta Quest, SteamVR, iOS and Android</p>
<p>There’s nothing quite like <em>Elsewhere Electric,</em> a fascinating blend of VR and mobile gaming. To solve puzzles, the VR player must take the role of the Installer who explores a facility, while their progress is aided by the Operator, a hacker controlled by the mobile user. On top of the unique cross-platform co-op experience, Games by Stitch throws in a rich retro-futuristic aesthetic, giving everything a striking, tactile feel.</p>
<h2>Eternal Strands</h2>
<figure><img alt="Eternal Strands combat" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" src="https://production-static.mobilesyrup.com/uploads/2025/12/eternal-strands.jpg" srcset="https://production-static.mobilesyrup.com/uploads/2025/12/eternal-strands.jpg 1920w, https://production-static.mobilesyrup.com/uploads/2025/12/eternal-strands-300x169.jpg 300w, https://production-static.mobilesyrup.com/uploads/2025/12/eternal-strands-1024x575.jpg 1024w, https://production-static.mobilesyrup.com/uploads/2025/12/eternal-strands-768x432.jpg 768w, https://production-static.mobilesyrup.com/uploads/2025/12/eternal-strands-1536x863.jpg 1536w, https://production-static.mobilesyrup.com/uploads/2025/12/eternal-strands-417x235.jpg 417w"/><figcaption>Image credit: Yellow Brick Games</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Developer/publisher:</strong> Yellow Brick Games (Quebec City, Que.)<br/>
<strong>Genre:</strong> Action-adventure<br/>
<strong>Platforms:</strong> PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC</p>
<p>Led by <em>Dragon Age </em>veteran Mike Laidlaw, the debut title of Yellow Brick Games quickly proved to be quite the ambitious experience. That’s because <em>Eternal Strands </em>is an eclectic combination of <em>Breath of the Wild </em>exploration, <em>Shadow of the Colossus </em>boss battles and <em>Monster Hunter</em> crafting. But that’s not to say Yellow Brick doesn’t introduce tricks of its own; far from it. Perhaps the coolest part of <em>Eternal Strands</em> is a surprisingly robust magic system that lets you fully manipulate enemies and the environment to truly great effect. Throw in a charming cast of misfits and more sublime music from Grammy-nominated composer Austin Wintory (<em>Journey</em>) and you have an all-around solid new IP.</p>
<h2>Fresh Tracks</h2>
<figure><img alt="Fresh Tracks" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" src="https://production-static.mobilesyrup.com/uploads/2025/12/fresh-tracks.jpg" srcset="https://production-static.mobilesyrup.com/uploads/2025/12/fresh-tracks.jpg 1920w, https://production-static.mobilesyrup.com/uploads/2025/12/fresh-tracks-300x169.jpg 300w, https://production-static.mobilesyrup.com/uploads/2025/12/fresh-tracks-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://production-static.mobilesyrup.com/uploads/2025/12/fresh-tracks-768x432.jpg 768w, https://production-static.mobilesyrup.com/uploads/2025/12/fresh-tracks-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://production-static.mobilesyrup.com/uploads/2025/12/fresh-tracks-417x235.jpg 417w"/><figcaption>Image credit: Buffalo Buffalo</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Developer/publisher: </strong>Buffalo Buffalo (Vancouver, B.C.)<br/>
<strong>Genre: </strong>Rhythm<br/>
<strong>Platforms:</strong> PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC</p>
<p><em>Fresh Tracks </em>is a <em>vibe</em>. To traverse the Norse-inspired mythical land of Norwyn, you’ll be skiing through colourful snowy vistas, hacking your way through targets as you go. That in itself makes it a solid (non-VR) <em>Beat Saber</em>-esque rhythm experience, but Buffalo Buffalo has also smartly injected it with roguelite elements in which you obtain upgrades that shake up each run. All of that, plus the catchy score and narration from fan-favourite character actor Peter Stormare (<em>Until Dawn</em>), put <em>Fresh Tracks </em>in pole position.</p>
<h2>Grounded 2</h2>
<figure><img alt="Grounded 2 combat" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" src="https://production-static.mobilesyrup.com/uploads/2025/07/grounded-2-combat.jpg" srcset="https://production-static.mobilesyrup.com/uploads/2025/07/grounded-2-combat.jpg 1920w, https://production-static.mobilesyrup.com/uploads/2025/07/grounded-2-combat-300x169.jpg 300w, https://production-static.mobilesyrup.com/uploads/2025/07/grounded-2-combat-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://production-static.mobilesyrup.com/uploads/2025/07/grounded-2-combat-768x432.jpg 768w, https://production-static.mobilesyrup.com/uploads/2025/07/grounded-2-combat-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://production-static.mobilesyrup.com/uploads/2025/07/grounded-2-combat-417x235.jpg 417w"/><figcaption>Image credit: Xbox</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Developer: </strong>Obsidian Entertainment (Irvine California) and Eidos Montreal (Montreal, Que.)<strong><br/>
 Publisher:</strong> Xbox<br/>
<strong>Genre:</strong> Survival, action-adventure<br/>
<strong>Platforms:</strong> Xbox Series X/S and PC (plus Xbox Game Pass)</p>
<p>For the follow-up to its popular 2022 survival game <em>Grounded</em>, <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2025/07/28/obsidian-entertainment-xbox-grounded-2-interview/">Obsidian Entertainment has teamed up with Eidos Montreal</a> (<em>Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy</em>). Even in early access, the game has meaningfully expanded on the core <em>Honey I Shrunk the Kids</em>-inspired experience, adding the highly-requested insect mounts, both streamlining and expanding the tools system, and introducing brand-new biomes. No doubt the developers will have even more cool things in store for players in 2026 and beyond.</p>
<h2>Hell is Us</h2>
<figure><img alt="Hell is Us" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" src="https://production-static.mobilesyrup.com/uploads/2025/12/hell-is-us.jpg" srcset="https://production-static.mobilesyrup.com/uploads/2025/12/hell-is-us.jpg 1920w, https://production-static.mobilesyrup.com/uploads/2025/12/hell-is-us-300x169.jpg 300w, https://production-static.mobilesyrup.com/uploads/2025/12/hell-is-us-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://production-static.mobilesyrup.com/uploads/2025/12/hell-is-us-768x432.jpg 768w, https://production-static.mobilesyrup.com/uploads/2025/12/hell-is-us-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://production-static.mobilesyrup.com/uploads/2025/12/hell-is-us-417x235.jpg 417w"/><figcaption>Image credit: Nacon</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Developer: </strong>Rogue Factor (Montreal, Que.)<strong><br/>
 Publisher:</strong> Nacon<br/>
<strong>Genre:</strong> Action-adventure<br/>
<strong>Platforms:</strong> PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC</p>
<p>While <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2025/12/03/eidos-montreal-layoffs-project-cancellations/">Embracer Group sadly keeps cutting the ever-talented Eidos Montreal to the bone</a>, several key alums from the studio have at least moved onto Rogue Factor and delivered one of the year’s neatest new IPs. Enter <em>Hell is Us</em>, which tells the story of a mysterious world ravaged by civil war and overrun by supernatural creatures. With a focus on atmospheric, unguided exploration and brutal melee combat, <em>Hell is Us </em>stands out from other action-adventure games.</p>
<h2>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</h2>
<figure><img alt="Lost Records Bloom &amp; Rage cast" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" src="https://production-static.mobilesyrup.com/uploads/2025/12/ss_014ee10912f8a01a19b9c64658f62e1743cd6d44.1920x1080.jpg" srcset="https://production-static.mobilesyrup.com/uploads/2025/12/ss_014ee10912f8a01a19b9c64658f62e1743cd6d44.1920x1080.jpg 1920w, https://production-static.mobilesyrup.com/uploads/2025/12/ss_014ee10912f8a01a19b9c64658f62e1743cd6d44.1920x1080-300x169.jpg 300w, https://production-static.mobilesyrup.com/uploads/2025/12/ss_014ee10912f8a01a19b9c64658f62e1743cd6d44.1920x1080-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://production-static.mobilesyrup.com/uploads/2025/12/ss_014ee10912f8a01a19b9c64658f62e1743cd6d44.1920x1080-768x432.jpg 768w, https://production-static.mobilesyrup.com/uploads/2025/12/ss_014ee10912f8a01a19b9c64658f62e1743cd6d44.1920x1080-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://production-static.mobilesyrup.com/uploads/2025/12/ss_014ee10912f8a01a19b9c64658f62e1743cd6d44.1920x1080-417x235.jpg 417w"/><figcaption>Image credit: Don’t Nod</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Developer: </strong>Don’t Nod Montreal (Montreal, Que.)<strong><br/>
 Publisher: </strong>Don’t Nod<br/>
<strong>Genre: </strong>Narrative adventure<br/>
<strong>Platforms: </strong>PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC</p>
<p>A spiritual successor to <em>Life is Strange </em>from several of its original creators, <em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage </em>is another heartfelt — but even more ambitious — teen drama. Right off the bat, <em>Bloom &amp; Rage </em>feels different from its forebearers by centring its choice-based narrative around protagonist Swann’s reunion with her childhood friends after 27 years. This framing perspective gives added weight to the flashback sequences that dig into the traumatic incident that drove them part, as well as their brief, but nonetheless deeply touching, summer friendship. It’s everything you love about <em>Life is Strange</em>, and more.</p>
<h2>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</h2>

<p><strong>Developer: </strong>Tribute Games (Montreal, Que.)<strong><br/>
 Publisher: </strong>Dotemu<br/>
<strong>Genre: </strong>Beat ’em up<br/>
<strong>Platforms: </strong>PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, and PC (plus Xbox Game Pass)</p>
<p><em><a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2025/12/01/montreal-tribute-games-marvel-cosmic-invasion-review/">Marvel Cosmic Invasion</a> </em>might have the simplest and most effective pitch of any game on this list: it’s a beat ’em up from the Canadian team behind 2022’s <em>TMNT: Shredder’s Revenge</em>, one of the genre’s absolute best. But rather than simply give us the same deliciously retro pixel art experience with a Marvel coat of paint, Tribute Games shakes up the formula with a significantly larger roster (including everyone from Spider-Man and Wolverine to Phyla-Vell and Beta Ray Bill) and <em>Marvel vs. Capcom</em>-esque team-centric combo system. Whether you’re playing alone or with up to three friends, this is easily some of the most fun you’ll have all year.</p>
<h2>Missile Command Delta</h2>

<p><strong>Developer: </strong>13 AM Games and Mighty Yell (both Toronto, Ont.)<strong><br/>
 Publisher: </strong>Atari<br/>
<strong>Genre: </strong>Strategy<br/>
<strong>Platforms: </strong>PS5, Nintendo Switch and PC</p>
<p>This excellent love child of Mighty Yell (the ’90s-set adventure game <em><a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2021/07/01/toronto-mighty-yell-the-big-con-xbox-pc-game-dave-proctor-interview/">The Big Con</a></em>) and 13AM Games (the Godzilla-inspired beat ’em up <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2022/04/22/toronto-13am-games-alex-rushdy-dawn-of-the-monsters-interview/"><em>Dawn of the Monsters</em></a>) is <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2025/07/07/atari-missile-command-delta-toronto-indie-developers-mighty-yell-13am-games-interview/">a novel take on the 1980 arcade shooter <em>Missile Command</em></a>. In the modern day, a group of teens inadvertently gets trapped in a bunker, forcing them to navigate its intricate weaponry to escape. This time capsule approach makes for an intriguing choice-based narrative featuring first-person exploration elements, while the twist on <em>Missile</em> <em>Command</em>‘s signature gameplay has you managing a hex-based grid using cards for salvos of various values. Deep and suspenseful, <em>Missile Command Delta </em>is a brilliant modernization of an arcade classic.</p>
<h2>Rift of the Necrodancer</h2>

<p><strong>Developer: </strong>Brace Yourself Games (Vancouver, B.C.) and TicToc Games (Burbank, California)<strong><br/>
 Publisher:</strong> Klei Entertainment (Vancouver, B.C.)<br/>
<strong>Genre:</strong> Rhythm<br/>
<strong>Platforms:</strong> Nintendo Switch and PC</p>
<p>After the sublime <em>Crypt of the NecroDancer </em>and <em>Zelda</em>-themed <em>Cadence of Hyrule</em>, Brace Yourself shifts from a grid-based roguelike rhythm experience to one focused on <em>Guitar Hero</em>-like lane-based scrolling. It’s a different, yet equally worthwhile, flavour from the developer’s previous games that retains its signature characters and personality. On top of that, <em>Rift of the NecroDancer </em>has turned into a celebration of indies, of sorts, thanks to a slew of free and paid DLC crossovers with the likes of <em>Celeste</em> (fellow Vancouver developer Extremely OK Games), <em>Super Meat Boy </em>(Team Meat) and <em>Shovel Knight </em>(Yacht Club Games).</p>

<p><strong>Developer/publisher: </strong>Thunder Lotus Games (Montreal, Que.)<br/>
<strong>Genre:</strong> Action roguelike, multiplayer<br/>
<strong>Platforms: </strong>Xbox Series X/S and PC</p>
<p>Launched in early access in March, <em>33 Immortals</em> draws on Dante’s <em>The Divine Comedy </em>and MMO raids to create a distinctive multiplayer experience. Alongside up to 32 other players, you’ll have to fight your way through the layers of Hell, Purgatory and Heaven to defeat God and escape. The compelling co-op framework and snappy combat hold a lot of promise, and we’re looking forward to seeing Thunder Lotus continue to expand upon the game leading up to its eventual 1.0 release.</p>

<p><strong>Developer: </strong>Ivy Road (a global team led by Davey Wreden and Karla Zimonja in Vancouver, B.C.) <strong><br/>

<strong>Platforms:</strong> PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC</p>
<p>From some of the minds behind indie darlings <em>The Stanley Parable </em>and <em>Gone Home </em>comes this cozy narrative adventure game. After suffering a setback, legendary warrior Alta finds herself serving tea at a shop in a magical forest. The tea brewing and gardening mechanics are relaxing in and of themselves, but the real highlight is the game’s surprisingly funny and meaningful exploration of the effects of burnout. Sometimes a cup of tea is all you need.</p>
<p>Of course, that covers only a fraction of the Canadian games that came out this year. Some of the other notable releases include:</p>
