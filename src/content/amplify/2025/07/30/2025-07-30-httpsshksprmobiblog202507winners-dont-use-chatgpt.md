<p>If you hung around video arcades in your youth, you would have seen this message burned into the phosphor of a thousand dying CRTs.</p>

<p>Obviously this was a devilish psyop by those gits who wanted kids to stop sniffing glue and having fun. The bastards!</p>
<p>But there's a more serious side to the corny message. Are you a winner if you've cheated?</p>
<p>Lance Armstrong "won" multiple <i>Toures de France</i>. It wasn't him that won though, it was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/23/sports/cycling/armstrong-stripped-of-his-7-tour-de-france-titles.html?_r=0">a cocktail of drugs and performance enhancers</a>.</p>
<p>Milli Vanilli got to the top of the music charts <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milli_Vanilli">by having someone else sing their vocals</a>.</p>
<p>You can watch the documentary <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0923752/">King of Kong</a> and decide for yourself if <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/02/did-billy-mitchell-use-this-illicit-joystick-to-set-a-donkey-kong-high-score/">allegations of cheating to get high-scores in Donkey Kong</a> are well founded.</p>
<p>The last one is interesting to me. I'm sure everyone here has turned to a gaming walkthough in a moment of frustration. Ah! So <em>that's</em> where the key was hidden! Onwards!</p>
<p>But once you've popped the walkthough cherry, how tempting is it to go back for just one more hit? Only a quick glance… And then, before you know it, you're no longer playing a game; you're watching a movie. You don't achieve anything by following a walkthrough, do you? You're little more than a monkey pressing the buttons in the order they flash.</p>
<p>That's fine if all you want to do is see the ending; but you can't really claim it as an achievement.</p>
<p>The same is true with cheats. ↑↑↓↓←→←→BA and now you have infinite lives and over-powered weapons. So what? You can glide through the game. You won't get any better at playing it. You won't learn. You'll just drift. You won't have any <a href="https://gizmodo.com/congratulations-to-ea-games-for-posting-the-most-hated-1820391000">pride and accomplishment</a> in what you've done.</p>
<p>Video games are better than real life. As the meme says:</p>

<p>If you had a cheat button for real life, would you press it?</p>
<p>Click here to suddenly be number one on YouTube.</p>
<p>Swipe here to get into the University of your dreams.</p>
<p>Prompt engineer your way to launching a killer app without knowing how to code.</p>
<p>No work necessary to accomplish anything. Click the cheat button and off you go! Amazing! You'd press it repeatedly, right?</p>
<p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/nameshiv.bsky.social/post/3lv4ejbhgkc2z">Shiv Ramdas</a> recently posted this provocation about the <a href="https://www.plagiarismtoday.com/2025/04/07/james-somerton-re-emerges-plagiarizes-again-disappears/">plagiarist James Somerton</a>:</p>
<blockquote> <p>There's an incredible essay that will break the internet waiting to be written about the throughline between walkthrough dependence, James Somerton and ChatGPT's effect on the human psyche</p> </blockquote>
<p>This isn't that essay. I'm too lazy to write something amazing, and too aware of the limitations of outsourcing my thinking.</p>
<p>But I see the pattern in myself.</p>
<ul> <li>I <em>could</em> learn that code's syntax, or I could press the cheat button. </li> <li>I <em>could</em> plan a trip, or I could press the cheat button. </li> <li>I <em>could</em> text my wife that I love her, or I could press the cheat button. </li> </ul>
<p>I'm sure you're going to write an impassioned comment about why sometimes pressing the cheat button is probably fine. The world is complex and sometimes you need a bit of a helping hand.</p>
<p>But hold onto that hand too long and it will hold you back.</p>
<p>Do I <em>really</em> believe that?</p>
<p>I'm never going to spend a few years learning French - so I'm quite content to chuck an AI a bit of translation work.</p>
<p>Some people like to spend a morning baking bread. Others like using a bread machine. Is that cheating? Who cares. It is <em>your</em> choice.</p>
<p>Why should I care <em>how</em> you're living your life. It doesn't bother me if you look up spoilers for films, hide a motor in your exercise bike, or always choose easy-mode on your games.</p>
<p>Perhaps you have no imagination and would rather an AI made up a bedtime story for your child. I suspect you're acting like <a href="https://www.psychologicalscience.org/publications/observer/obsonline/harlows-classic-studies-revealed-the-importance-of-maternal-contact.html">the infamous Wire Mother</a>. A simulation of love with few of the benefits.</p>
<p>I can't imagine using an AI to woo my wife. But then, I've seen Cyrano de Bergerac.</p>
<p>Each of us has to draw a line somewhere. We each find a certain level of cheating acceptable when we do it - and despicable when others get away with it.</p>
