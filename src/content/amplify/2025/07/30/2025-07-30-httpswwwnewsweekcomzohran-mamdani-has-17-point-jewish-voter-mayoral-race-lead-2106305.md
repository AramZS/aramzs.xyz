title: Zohran Mamdani Scores 17-Point Lead with Jewish Voters in NYC Mayoral Race
---
<p>New York State Assembly member <a data-sys="1" href="https://www.newsweek.com/topic/zohran-mamdani">Zohran Mamdani</a> commands a 17-point lead among Jewish voters in the upcoming New York City mayoral race, according to newly released polling.</p>
<p>The survey from Zenith Research and Public Progress Solutions found that Mamdani's support among Jewish voters surpassed all other candidates, reflecting a complex realignment in the wake of his decisive victory over former Governor <a data-sys="1" href="https://www.newsweek.com/topic/andrew-cuomo">Andrew Cuomo</a> in the Democratic primary.</p>
<p><em>Newsweek </em>reached out to Mamdani's campaign team via email for comment.</p>

<h2>Why It Matters</h2>
<p>New York City hosts the largest Jewish population outside Israel and political analysts have long viewed this demographic as critical in mayoral contests.</p>
<p>Mamdani's support among Jewish voters comes despite repeated accusations from opponents and some community leaders that his criticism of Israel represents antisemitism.</p>
<p>His performance suggests growing acceptance among parts of the Jewish electorate—particularly younger and less religious voters—of candidates who hold critical views of Israeli policy, potentially signaling a shift in the priorities of one of the city's most influential voting blocs.</p>
<h2>What To Know</h2>
<p>The Zenith Research and Public Progress Solutions poll surveyed 1,453 New York City residents between July 16 and July 24. Among Jewish respondents likely to vote in the November mayoral election, 43 percent said they supported Mamdani, compared to 26 percent for Cuomo, his closest competitor who is now running as an independent following his Democratic primary defeat.</p>
<p>Despite his <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/zohran-mamdani-new-york-new-york-post-mayor-democratic-party-elections-2089835">outspoken criticism of Israel and refusal to disavow phrases associated with Palestinian activism</a>, Mamdani outperformed more moderate candidates, including Mayor Eric Adams—who opted to run for re-election as an independent before the Democratic primary—and <a data-sys="1" href="https://www.newsweek.com/topic/republican">Republican</a> Curtis Sliwa, among both Jewish and non-Jewish voters.</p>
<p>The poll's findings are especially notable against the backdrop of heightened tensions in New York's Jewish community, which has faced increased anti-Jewish hate crimes and debates over safety, city policy, and Israel. Despite such concerns, voters indicated that issues such as housing affordability, public safety, and government integrity were <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/zohran-mamdani-andrew-cuomo-eric-adams-nyc-mayor-2105971">more influential in their vote choice than foreign policy or religious identity</a>.</p>

<p>Mamdani has consistently denied allegations of antisemitism, stating his criticism is directed solely at Israeli government actions, not Jewish people. He has also pledged to increase city funding for anti-hate crime programming and to foster dialogue within religious communities.</p>
<p>The poll also suggests Mamdani has built a broad progressive coalition, with strong support from the young, LGBTQ+, and college-educated voters across racial and ethnic groups.</p>
<p>The poll's methodology noted a margin of error of 2.9 percent for registered voters, with slightly higher error rates among likely Jewish voters due to sample size. The results reflect a possible generational and ideological realignment, as younger and more progressive Jewish voters appear less likely to equate criticism of Israel with antisemitism.</p>
<p>Mamdani's strong showing follows his Democratic primary win, where he captured 56 percent of the overall citywide vote, with Cuomo trailing at 44 percent.</p>
<h2>What People Are Saying</h2>
<p><strong>Rabbi Shimon Hecht, of Congregation B'nai Jacob in Brooklyn, said last month following the Democratic primary: </strong>"I think like every upsetting election, it's a wake-up call for people … I strongly believe that [Mamdani] will not be elected as our next mayor, but it's going to take a lot of uniting among the Jewish people and others who are concerned about these issues. We have to unify."</p>
<p><strong>Aiyana Leong Knauer, a 35-year-old Brooklyn bartender who is Jewish and backed Mamdani, said:</strong> "[The primary is] New Yorkers, many of them Jewish, saying we care more about having an affordable city than sowing division … Many of us take really deep offense to our history being weaponized against us … Jewish people all over the world have well-founded fears for their safety, but Jews in New York are safe overall."</p>
<p><strong>Zohran Mamdani said in a statement following his primary win:</strong> "I am humbled by the support of more than 545,000 New Yorkers in last week's primary. This is just the beginning of our expanding coalition to make New York City affordable. And we will do it together."</p>
<h2>What Happens Next</h2>
<p>The New York City mayoral general election is scheduled for November 4, 2025.</p>
<p>Both Cuomo and Adams could impact the final outcome if they remain in the race, while Sliwa is hoping for a long-shot upset in a fractured field.</p>
