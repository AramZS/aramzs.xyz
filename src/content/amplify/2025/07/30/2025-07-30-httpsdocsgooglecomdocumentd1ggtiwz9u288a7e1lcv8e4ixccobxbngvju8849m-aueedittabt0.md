<h1>Introduction: Fighting Authoritarianism</h1>
<p>Every day, the Trump regime deploys strategies from the classic authoritarian playbook in its aggressive attempt to dismantle our democracy.</p>
<p>Trump and his cronies are politicizing independent institutions, and undermining our democratic norms and civic dialogue. They are working to crush dissent by retaliating against the <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.freepress.net/news/trump-tells-congress-rescind-funding-public-media&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1753899528523630&amp;usg=AOvVaw37aYazRjTFEytUS5TyRXBo">press</a>, <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/06/los-angeles-ice-protests-helicopter/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1753899528523788&amp;usg=AOvVaw3PIf-OnSg_kt46e-kGW9fC">protesters</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/09/us/politics/trump-civil-rights.html&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1753899528523920&amp;usg=AOvVaw3xnXKVOJisL7389b1y2_uv">vulnerable communities</a> seeking to exercise their basic rights. They are stoking violence, corrupting elections and illegally expanding executive powers. The administration is doing everything it can to confuse and disempower us — and is spreading disinformation to distract us from its corrupt actions and anti-democratic activities.</p>
<p>Destabilizing this authoritarian climate requires solidarity and action. We must hold the line with coordinated collective actions across political parties, civil society, media and the people.</p>
<p>Why this toolkit? It can feel overwhelming to grapple with the question “What can I do?” We get asked this question a lot, which is why we created this toolkit. It provides a roadmap with information, tools and actions that we can all take from home, in public — both individually and in community — while considering our rights and our risks. The toolkit is a living document that our team will update as the situation in our country evolves.</p>
<p>Who is this toolkit for? This toolkit is for everyone asking “What can I do to help defend our democracy?”</p>
<p>This toolkit gives journalists, newsrooms, activists and all of us ways to engage directly with our communities, tools to help us feel prepared and to know our rights — and ways to stay safe while pushing back against the rising authoritarian climate.</p>
<p>When we fight, we win. We have many examples of people successfully pushing back: The Tesla-takedown protests <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://abcnews.go.com/Business/tesla-earnings-show-anti-musk-backlash-damaged-bottom/story?id%3D121008566&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1753899528526654&amp;usg=AOvVaw3qV0KzjK8Sd-jWATrMbekS">tanked the company’s stock</a> and made the brand toxic too. As a result of people spreading the word about the law firms that bent the knee to Trump, many <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.wsj.com/us-news/law/law-firms-trump-deals-clients-71b3616d&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1753899528526982&amp;usg=AOvVaw0VZ4hryg04wVr9KD3KSrj_">corporations are taking their dollars</a> away from these firms and going to the law firms that actually resisted. <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/05/may-day-demonstration-thousands-call-on-the-trump-administration-to-return-kilmar-abrego-garcia/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1753899528527256&amp;usg=AOvVaw0qAzMzhxLmqEx9gIM_m1Gh">Mass protests across the country</a> have pushed back against the administration’s moves to dismiss due process, and helped make the deportation and imprisonment in El Salvador of Kilmar Abrego Garcia an unpopular topic for Trump. And millions took to the streets during the June 14 <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.democracynow.org/2025/6/16/no_kings&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1753899528527740&amp;usg=AOvVaw1KUirwAUjkypzotYI4r-Yj">No Kings Day protests</a>, successfully overshadowing Trump’s military parade.</p>
<p>Resisting authoritarianism requires that we, the people, exercise our power. In the words of Baher Azmy, the legal director of the Center for Constitutional Rights: “It is action that produces hope, not the other way around.”</p>
<p>What follows is a comprehensive toolkit to give you ideas for how you can take action both from home and out in the world. We also have tips on how to stay safe online and off.</p>

<h1>Part I: Understanding the Threats Facing Our Communities</h1>
<p>Information is power. To start with, we have to understand how the Trump administration is sabotaging the federal government — and how this is having catastrophic impacts on communities around the country.</p>
<p>From the very beginning, Donald Trump’s second term has featured exhaustive attempts to roll back basic rights, gut agencies to eliminate checks on his power, sabotage an independent press and demonize any groups — including universities, activists, law firms, public-health experts and artists — that refuse to capitulate. Meanwhile, the billionaires controlling our information environments are leveraging their power and platforms to control and contort public discourse, cozying up to the president while growing their fortunes.</p>
<p>Trump is attacking our basic freedoms to avoid accountability and distract public focus from his own illegal actions. He has various willing accomplices. For example, Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr has undermined free speech and press freedom as he carries out Trump’s promises of retribution for those who report critically on the administration. Meanwhile, Secretary of State Marco Rubio claims to have taken up the mantle of freedom but is going after students, journalists and protesters to try to remove anyone that the administration designates as a threat (in other words, anyone who criticizes the administration or engages in dissent).</p>
<p>The litany of attacks is designed to weaken civil society, broaden executive power and neuter the Fourth Estate. They chip away at our ability to respond to what’s happening, undermine our sense of community and erode longstanding democratic norms — even as the White House pretends that it’s <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.vox.com/on-the-right-newsletter/396127/trump-democracy-executive-orders-day-one&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1753899528534643&amp;usg=AOvVaw3TTULVE7Dkh_6eSpmVHPtz">defending</a> our democracy and national security. Such manipulation of the public narrative is a common tactic that authoritarians leverage to paralyze us.</p>
<p>However imperfect throughout the centuries, this country was founded on the premise that our public sphere and our free press should be protected against government manipulation or retribution — including from the president and any “special government employees.” Free speech and the exercise of our basic constitutional rights should not be a privilege reserved for those who comply with people in power. Our constitutional rights should never be reserved for certain viewpoints, identities, skin colors, genders, sexual orientations and religions. Freedom and the rule of law are not meant to protect only the rich and powerful.</p>
<p>Because this administration is retaliatory in nature, communities must understand what their rights are when they consider organizing against authoritarianism. We also must understand that knowing our rights is not a fail-safe: We all carry different degrees of risk nowadays if we dare to disagree with techno-overlord thugs who engage in lawless behavior to grab and grow their power. And some of us carry more risks than others based on the color of our skin, our immigration status, our English-language fluency, our gender identities and other markers that white supremacists use to “other” us.</p>
<p>Whether it’s the opinions we share online, the protests we participate in on the street, or our desire to check out books about human rights, the Constitution protects everyone’s freedom and equity of access to ideas and opportunity. And we must defend it.</p>
<p>Know your rights and your risks</p>
<p>It’s important to know your rights so you can safely assert them. However, there is no way to guarantee that law enforcement will respect your rights when you participate in demonstrations. On the ground, the Bill of Rights cannot protect you from being harassed or searched. It cannot protect you from having your property seized, or from being arrested simply for attending a protest or attempting to film the police.</p>
<p>There are additional risks for people who are here in the United States on a visa or who are undocumented. And Trump has vowed — in complete contradiction of the Constitution — that he would strip U.S. citizens of their citizenship if he deems them a “threat” to the country. This is intended to chill our free expression and minimize our sense of power.</p>
<p>When we do exercise our rights — whether they’re press freedoms or ones that the broader public holds — we must understand the rising lawlessness that Trump openly courts and normalizes through his rhetoric and actions. While we may be fearful about engaging in otherwise constitutionally protected activities like protests or even online forms of expression, we cannot cede ground due to these fears. Authoritarian leaders weaken society to remove critique from public spaces and shut down inquiry into their own misconduct.</p>
<p>By exercising our rights, we are organizing against authoritarianism. Do so with information and knowledge; do so with community — but make sure to do so.</p>
<p>The basics of your First Amendment rights</p>
<p>“Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.”</p>
<p>In other words, the First Amendment is designed to prevent the government from censoring and silencing the people. The First Amendment prohibits the government from limiting our freedoms of speech, assembly, press, religion and ability to petition. These are essential rights to exercise during this period. The Civil Rights Era was fueled by Black Americans and allies exercising their protest rights, marching, publishing condemnations of racism, and speaking out about the need for equality and justice.</p>
<p>As civil-rights icon John Lewis said, “when you see something wrong, you must stand up. You must get into good trouble.” When we feel unheard, protest and other forms of free speech can be the most essential tool we have to undermine injustice and shift power dynamics.</p>
<p>The basics of your Fourth Amendment rights</p>
<p>Before the Bill of Rights was enacted, early U.S. legal scholars worried about how to prevent the country from becoming like Britain. There, with the advent of the printing press in 1440, the king prevented journalists and authors from publishing works critical of the crown — or anything that would inspire the people to hold the king accountable. During the reign of Charles II, royal officials broke into the home of the dissident printer and author John Twyn, seized his unpublished writing and executed him for so-called crimes against the king. In this country, the Fourth Amendment was adopted to provide a check on those in power — and to prevent people’s belongings and homes being seized without some underlying cause:</p>
<p>“The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.”</p>
<p>If the First Amendment is a check on those in power and their ability to suppress ideas, words and assemblies, the Fourth Amendment is a check on what those in power can do to our persons, our property and our privacy.</p>
<p>The basics of the Fourteenth Amendment</p>
<p>Following the Civil War, the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted during the Reconstruction Era and is often considered one of the most important amendments to the Constitution. Its enactment was essential to correct gross inequities, giving full citizenship to formerly enslaved peoples.</p>
<p>Trump’s efforts to undermine and remove people’s citizenship — whether they’re naturalized citizens or what he perceives as political enemies — draws on a dark period in American history. It echoes earlier efforts to segregate and dehumanize minority groups. Now, we are seeing the fruits of those efforts in the ways that law enforcement is arresting, detaining and stripping people of their due-process rights for their speech, their skin color and sometimes their actions.</p>
<p>In part, the Fourteenth Amendment states: “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.”</p>
<h1>Part II: The Media’s Role In Safeguarding Democracy</h1>
<p>The Fourth Estate — imperfect as it has been over the centuries — is an essential defense against fascism and can help expose government misconduct while probing issues that matter to the public. This is why capturing the media is one of the key strategies would-be dictators around the globe deploy. By controlling the media, autocrats restrict people's access to truthful, balanced and independent information — restricting what we’re aware of and transforming the media into leaders’ personal propaganda machines.</p>
<p>Like authoritarians throughout history, Trump is obsessed with controlling the narrative and his public image. He has removed journalists who dare to hold him accountable from press briefings. He has launched attacks against those whose coverage he dislikes, revoked press passes and sued various newsrooms even as he privileges regime-friendly propagandists. Trump isn’t just threatening journalistic freedoms; he’s also actively undermining the public’s right to access a diverse array of ideas and viewpoints about the presidency and important issues.</p>
<p>On July 18, Congress approved Trump’s request to <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.freepress.net/news/house-follows-senate-and-claws-back-all-federal-funding-corporation-public-broadcasting&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1753899528547733&amp;usg=AOvVaw2xSiQSgto8fM-gKLZXvqg1">claw back $1.1 billion in federal funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting</a>. This move is a blow to anyone who cares about the role the media must play to sustain a democracy — and it will impact essential educational and multilingual programming, invaluable accountability journalism and the broadcast of emergency information. To be clear, <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.freepress.net/blog/defunding-public-media-makes-perfect-sense-if-destroying-democracy-goal&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1753899528548314&amp;usg=AOvVaw15XRRetDe-060-ppmNguT5">defunding public media</a> makes sense if the goal is to destroy our democracy.</p>
<p>Our information environments have never been neutral. But while many U.S. media institutions cozied up to political figures during previous administrations, these companies’ surrender to the tyranny of Trumpism poses an existential crisis of an entirely different scale. These companies are enabling the Trump regime even as it’s actively and openly attacking journalism and undermining free speech. Caving to Trump has become a pattern across the entire establishment media sector, from broadcasting and entertainment companies to online platforms and newspaper owners.</p>
<p>Their cowardly capitulations expose the deep structural rot at the root of our entire media, journalism and communications system. And they raise important questions about a captured media-policy infrastructure — fueled by hundreds of millions of dollars in fees to corporate lobbyists, lawyers and trade groups — that has allowed a relatively small group of media and telecommunications companies to become this enormous. As the Trump administration — with the help of a compliant Federal Communications Commission — attempts to <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.tvtechnology.com/news/fcc-seeks-public-comments-on-changing-broadcast-ownership-rules&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1753899528550190&amp;usg=AOvVaw1cuZTUfFr8MW1fR3h8d7B-">roll back limits to media consolidation</a>, it’s worth recognizing that bigger media isn’t better for the people and our democracy.</p>
<p>What can we do?</p>
<p>The media’s role is to act as a check on abuses of power. They must provide the news and information people need to participate fully in their communities and our country. Newsrooms must identify threats to democracy and support their journalists’ efforts to hold leaders to account. Here’s what you can do to ensure that the media fulfill its obligations:</p>
<ul><li>Support and subscribe to local journalism outlets</li></ul>
<ul><li>Get to know your local reporters. Help them find the stories that matter to your community by writing a letter to the editor; inviting a reporter or editor to your community event, meeting or public forum; submitting a story, photo or video for publication; and participating in a discussion with an editor or reporter on social media.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Pressure media outlets to provide context </li></ul>
<ul><li>News outlets should always provide context (for example, the history and background on a given issue). U.S. democracy is built on a foundation of checks and balances against authoritarianism. Our media must err on the side of including more historical context to explain “how we got here.”</li></ul>
<ul><li>Pressure media outlets to fact check </li></ul>
<ul><li>The media must fact check and cite their sources. </li></ul>
<ul><li>Demand that the media identify and name authoritarian and autocratic rhetoric. </li></ul>
<ul><li>The rhetoric of authoritarian leaders and the expression of autocratic views delegitimize the democratic process, dehumanize minority groups, disregard the rule of law, and support violence and retribution against critics — including the media. Reporting on the extremist speech and behaviors of political figures, candidates, political parties and influencers must be done directly and without equivocation — or the pretext of “balanced” coverage. </li><li>Hold media outlets accountable when they normalize authoritarian practices and language.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Consume trustworthy news </li></ul>
<ul><li>Pursuing reputable sources of information will have a ripple effect on your communities, as folks will like and share information that you have taken steps to verify. This will also help build trust within your community. Fight lies coming from our political leaders and other influential figures, online and offline: Fact check and double check. Misinformation and false claims can spread rapidly during heightened crisis periods, undermining trust in the democratic process. The more times a lie is repeated, even in casual references, the harder it is to later debunk that lie. </li></ul>
<ul><li>Advocate for structural reforms that support the future of local news</li></ul>
<ul><li>Support local, state and federal ways to bolster local news. Support efforts (like the <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://njcivicinfo.org/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1753899528555227&amp;usg=AOvVaw2QR4w4wM4Hs5CLlxYzsYP4">New Jersey Civic Information Consortium</a>) that use state funding to strengthen local journalism. Call or email your lawmakers — or schedule an in-district meeting with them — to urge them to protect press freedom.</li></ul>

And remember to use end-to-end encrypted messaging and calling applications like <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://signal.org/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1753899528561878&amp;usg=AOvVaw20k6adBp8fnfeQfETbzh6s">Signal</a> to connect with — and protect — your friends, family and yourself against surveillance and tracking.</p>
<p>Find and support trusted advocacy groups and organizations</p>

<p>Call your representatives</p>
<p>Why should you call your representative? Because these calls make a difference! Elected officials are more likely to remain in office if their constituents believe they represent and protect their interests.</p>
<p>There is a lot of legislation moving at any given time in the Capitol, and often important provisions get buried in massive bills. Because of this, it’s important that lawmakers are aware of their constituents’ priorities. Organizations that are paying close attention to legislation can be reliable sources for updates on issues you care about.</p>
<p>Follow trusted advocacy groups to learn more about what legislation is moving, and how it impacts you, your loved ones and your community. Then contact your lawmakers and let them know what your position is.</p>

<p>Tips for calling your representatives</p>
<ul><li>Call: 202-224-3121 (call during business hours Eastern Time). </li><li>Follow the prompts that apply to you</li></ul>
<ul><li>Typically a staffer or intern will pick up, or you’ll be prompted to leave a message.</li><li>Introduce yourself</li><li>State why you are calling, and explain your position on the issue. </li><li>They may ask for your ZIP code and/or ask you to repeat your name (just your first name should be sufficient)</li><li>That’s it!

<p>Hello! My name is [First Name]. I'm a constituent and am calling to ask Sen./Rep. [NAME] to restore funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. In a time of rising authoritarianism, we need independent journalism more than ever. Public media is one of our nation’s most valuable public goods, with overwhelming support among people from all 50 states and all political leanings.</p>
<p>Tips for emailing your representatives</p>
<p>Advocacy groups have ready-made emails where the only thing you need to do is add your name, email, city and ZIP code. Here are just a few examples of how contacting your elected officials can make a difference:</p>
<table><tbody><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>“Nonprofit Killer Bill” (HR 9495, Stop Terror-Financing and Tax Penalties on American Hostages Act): This bill would have given the Treasury Department the power to investigate any nonprofit organization — and strip it of its tax-exempt status — based on a unilateral accusation of wrongdoing. The potential for abuse from an authoritarian administration was extremely high. In 2024, the Republican-controlled House of Representatives voted on this legislation twice. The first vote failed due to the widespread public outcry; the bill passed on the second vote only because Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson changed the rules to make it easier to move it forward. The Senate, which Democrats then controlled, did not take up the legislation.</p><p>When Republicans reintroduced the bill in 2025 and attached it to must-pass budget legislation, thousands of constituents spoke out. While it passed the House again, dozens of lawmakers who previously supported the bill switched their votes to vote against it — and the bill was subsequently removed from the budget package.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>
<table><tbody><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP) funding: By 2024, the ACP — a Federal Communications Commission program that subsidized the cost of high-speed internet access for low-income people — had proven so successful that it needed additional congressional funding to keep it going. Both public-interest groups and internet service providers were invested in getting at least short-term funding to keep the program viable through the end of the year while Congress figured out a long-term funding mechanism.</p><p>The Affordable Connectivity Program Extension Act would have accomplished this, though it never advanced to a full floor vote. However, it had over 200 bipartisan sponsors in the House of Representatives. In the months leading up to the program's end date in June 2024, both Democratic and Republican offices said that the ACP was among the top issues that constituents were calling about.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>
<table><tbody><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>The Fourth Amendment Is Not For Sale Act (FANFSA) would have closed the “data-broker loophole” by prohibiting intelligence and federal law-enforcement agencies from purchasing personal information from data brokers. It has been introduced multiple times — and passed the House in April 2024. Even though the bill did not advance in the Senate that year, its passage out of the House is proof that educating lawmakers about unchecked government surveillance and pressuring them to take action can help legislation like this move forward.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

<h1>Part IV: Actions People Can Take in Public</h1>
<p>It’s important to balance risks with rights as we all have differing levels of risks. Before you take any actions out in public, make sure that you have first secured your digital devices (see “Practice Digital Security,” p. 16).</p>
<p>Taking communal actions in public sends a powerful message. As previously noted, we already have many examples of successful protests. The Tesla takedown protests <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://abcnews.go.com/Business/tesla-earnings-show-anti-musk-backlash-damaged-bottom/story?id%3D121008566&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1753899528584710&amp;usg=AOvVaw314ltGOewC8D0OwVQfZA7p">tanked the company’s stock</a> and made the brand toxic. <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/05/may-day-demonstration-thousands-call-on-the-trump-administration-to-return-kilmar-abrego-garcia/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1753899528584947&amp;usg=AOvVaw3CL7TyvyYa2DtjKNGiYUMs">Mass protests across the country</a> have pushed back against the administration’s move to dismiss due process, and helped make the deportation and imprisonment in El Salvador of Kilmar Abrego Garcia an unpopular topic for Trump.

<p>Connect and advocate with community: organizing for change</p>
<p>Organizing is a process of building power for collective action, and it often begins by identifying a specific issue impacting people in your community, developing trusting relationships and listening to neighbors’ perspectives on the issue you want to address. This foundation allows you to decide on a common goal together, identify a potential target for your actions, and design strategies and tactics that will help you win.</p>
<p>You don’t need to start from scratch. There are many well-organized groups — like Indivisible and Sunrise Movement — leading efforts at the local, state and national levels that you can plug into where you live.</p>
<p>But you can also start organizing in your community by reaching out to your neighbors; planning a small gathering at the local park, library or someone’s home; and deciding on a few easy steps to get started. Early on, it’s important to focus on specific, concrete things you can do together to build your collective power and momentum, so people stay engaged and feel encouraged by every small win.</p>
<p>Protest safely</p>
<p>The First Amendment provides broad protections for our rights to protest and hold government officials accountable. However, on the ground, the First Amendment cannot protect you from being harassed by police or ICE — or from being arrested for protesting. Read more about your constitutional rights above in Part I (p. 5). Free Press’ legal experts have also put together a helpful resource, <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.freepress.net/sites/default/files/2025-04/protesting_in_2025_free_press_action.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1753899528589907&amp;usg=AOvVaw0HpYj_ovACnoC-1SxNaJM4">“Protesting in 2025”</a>.</p>
<p>In-district drop-ins</p>
<p>You can stop by lawmakers’ local offices without making an appointment. You can do so as an individual or as part of a group. Keep in mind that meeting with your lawmakers is one of the most impactful ways to take action on issues that matter to you. Read Free Press Action’s <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/16pBmHH_Jxq_R4yFmbMqmhgSD1tmCMzfrK7fr-_0vOWQ/edit?tab%3Dt.0&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1753899528590639&amp;usg=AOvVaw1B-Wv1IWDJ5UB1IJQqbyxs">in-district drop-in resource</a> for more information. You can email us at <a href="mailto:info@freepress.net">info@freepress.net</a> at any point during the process if you have any questions.</p>
<p>Testify at local meetings, city-council hearings and state-level hearings</p>
<p>Lawmakers hear a lot from corporate lobbyists — but the group they really need to hear from is people like you. Testifying at open meetings is a great way to make your voice heard. These meetings provide a forum for community members to communicate directly with decision-makers, and ensure that their voices are documented as part of the official record. By sharing your perspectives at open meetings, you can influence the decisions that shape our communities.</p>
<h1>Part V: Practice Digital Security</h1>
<p>Practicing digital security is a critical first step when mobilizing against Trump’s authoritarian regime. Whether you are taking actions from home or out in public, securing your digital devices is essential to safeguarding your privacy and to <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.wired.com/story/the-wired-guide-to-protecting-yourself-from-government-surveillance/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1753899528593778&amp;usg=AOvVaw0MHAo6oKTuFa56ExDD3FBN">protecting you from surveillance</a>, data collection and tracking.</p>

<ol start="3"><li>Block trackers using <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ghostery.com/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1753899528606067&amp;usg=AOvVaw2SLbQew7z3YHxqrh9nR9cy">Ghostery</a> or another reputable tool.</li></ol>
<ul><li>Ghostery is a tool that helps protect your online privacy while you browse the internet. Think of it as a filter that blocks unwanted ads and trackers that can follow your online activities. When you visit a website, various advertisers and trackers often place small pieces of code on the page. These can gather information about what you’re looking at, where you go online and what your personal preferences are. Ghostery detects these trackers and gives you the option to block them. By doing this, it helps reduce the number of ads you see and keeps your personal information more secure.</li><li>In addition to blocking trackers, Ghostery helps speed up your browsing experience since fewer ads mean pages load faster. It works like a protective shield, allowing you to enjoy the internet more freely, without being constantly monitored or annoyed by irrelevant advertisements.</li></ul>

<p>Become less valuable to digital-media platforms</p>
<p>Most digital-media platforms — and all of the most popular social-media platforms — are for-profit entities. They are “free” to you because you are the product that they are selling: your data, your online activity, your preferences, your contacts … your every move. These platforms may be free, but that does not mean that you do not incur a huge cost: your privacy and your increased exposure to manipulative practices via mis- and disinformation.</p>
<p>Free Press has studied the privacy pitfalls for users on an array of social-media apps, finding that their corporate hunger for our data and information is insatiable. You can read more about the privacy policies at companies in our landmark report <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.freepress.net/sites/default/files/2023-11/insatiable_the_tech_industry_quest_for_all_our_data_free_press_action_report_final.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1753899528611800&amp;usg=AOvVaw0tJoloGZM7qsi7DBPX0WCi">Insatiable: The Tech Industry’s Quest for All Our Data</a> and learn about <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.freepress.net/blog/what-congress-ftc-can-do-now-protect-against-ai-abuses&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1753899528611958&amp;usg=AOvVaw04je89eMCFZkqDIYr3EM98">ways</a> that Congress can take action to protect our digital civil rights.</p>
<p>Protect yourself — and become less valuable to digital platforms like Amazon, Bluesky, Google, LinkedIn, Meta, Pinterest, TikTok, X and YouTube — by adjusting your security and privacy settings. And avoid linking unnecessary apps to your social-media accounts, as they can collect and misuse your data.</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>“Action produces hope.” And solidarity is critical. Pushing back against the Trump regime’s aggressive authoritarian takeover requires all hands on deck. Whether you take individual actions from home or out in public, it is imperative that we all continue to resist. We all have differing levels of risks, so make sure you balance your rights and your risks — and that you practice digital security before you take any action.</p>
