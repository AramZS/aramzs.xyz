  As the line blurs between SSPs and DSPs, forget the drama, says Nexxen's Kara
  Puccinelli. The question should be: Is the tech effective?

<p>DSPs are building tools to bypass SSPs and SSPs are trying to cut out the buy side. <a data-wpel-link="internal" href="https://www.adexchanger.com/data-driven-thinking/why-ssps-and-dsps-are-breaking-the-barrier-between-supply-and-demand/">It’s a dramatic tale</a>, at least by ad tech standards.</p>
<p>But the real question in the noise is whether the technology improves advertising effectiveness, says Kara Puccinelli, chief customer officer at Nexxen, on this week’s episode of AdExchanger Talks.</p>
<p>Point solutions are passé, but there’s a place in the supply chain for anything that provides value, and both DSPs and SSPs can provide value. </p>
<p>For example, a demand-side platform is better at helping control for reach and frequency, while an SSP contributes valuable insights on auction and pricing dynamics.</p>
<p>It’s not a bad thing for the lines to blur a little, says Puccinelli, who joined Nexxen in 2022 as part of <a data-wpel-link="internal" href="https://www.adexchanger.com/digital-tv/tremors-amobee-acquisition-is-about-plugging-holes-and-getting-scale/">Tremor International’s acquisition of TV-focused DSP Amobee</a>, where she’d spent nearly 10 years in multiple executive roles, including as CCO.</p>
<p>“If we have technology that isn’t speaking on the same data layer [or] that doesn’t have the same identity solution connected,” she says, “then the whole benefit of having something be end-to-end goes away.”</p>

<p>Nexxen just so happens to position itself as an end-to-end platform. That’s simply the way forward, Puccinelli says – unifying buy-side tech, sell-side tech, data, AI and creative tools for better cross-channel advertising.</p>
<p>“The winners are the people that have the technology integrated,” she says.</p>
<p><strong>Also in this episode</strong>: Nexxen’s big investments in AI for planning, activation, optimization and monetization; whether Chrome Privacy Sandbox testing was actually worth it; and Puccinelli’s love of adventure sports.</p>
