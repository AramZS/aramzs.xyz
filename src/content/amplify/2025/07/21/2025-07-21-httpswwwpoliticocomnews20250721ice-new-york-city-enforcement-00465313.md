<p>NEW YORK — The Department of Homeland Security will “flood the zone” with Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in New York City after the City Council <a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/2025/06/13/judge-blocks-mayor-from-allowing-ice-on-rikers/">blocked</a> federal law enforcement agencies from opening an office in the city jails, President Donald Trump’s border czar Tom Homan said Monday morning.</p>
<p>Homan joined DHS Secretary Kristi Noem and other Trump administration officials to deliver that message at One World Trade Center after an off-duty federal customs <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/20/nyregion/customs-officer-shooting-migrant-nyc.html">officer was shot</a> by an undocumented immigrant in an attempted robbery Saturday night, Noem said.</p>
<p>“You don’t want to let us in the jails to arrest a bad guy in the safety and security of a jail. You want to release him into the street, which makes it unsafe for the alien, because anything can happen in an on-street arrest,” Homan said. “So what are we gonna do? We’re gonna put more agents in New York City to look for that bad guy. So sanctuary cities get exactly what they don’t want: more agents in the community.”</p>
<p>The alleged shooter entered the country illegally in 2023 during then-President Joe Biden’s tenure and had been arrested and released four times in the years since, Noem said. She blamed the shooting on New York’s sanctuary city policies that limit the city’s cooperation with civil immigration enforcement and Mayor Eric Adams for not changing the policies, despite his good relationship with the Trump administration.</p>
<p>“Make no mistake, this officer is in the hospital today fighting for his life because of the policies of the mayor of this city and the City Council and the people that were in charge of keeping the public safe. They refused to do so,” Noem said.</p>
<p>Adams has said he wants to cooperate with federal authorities on immigration more but blamed the left-leaning City Council for not letting him. “I have nothing to do with the rules that are put in place. I just carry out the rules,” Adams said at an unrelated press conference Monday when asked to respond to Noem.</p>
<p>Adams said he welcomes more ICE agents in the city if they’re going to help the city go after “dangerous people” like the alleged shooter, but said that “if it’s going to be to go after everyday individuals who are trying to complete the path, who are trying to be a citizen, I don’t think we should do that.”</p>
<p>The City Council did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine, the Democratic nominee for city comptroller, shot back. “To be clear: ICE can and does detail people on Rikers,” <a href="https://x.com/MarkLevineNYC/status/1947311950335013031">he posted on X</a>, referring to the island holding the city’s jails. “They just need a judicial warrant. [What] Homan is talking about is sending masked, unidentified agents into our streets to tear apart families and raid workplaces. This is not about safety. It’s about instilling fear.”</p>
<p>The plan to increase staffing in New York City comes after <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/06/16/trump-ice-raids-farm-workers-truce-00405777">Trump vowed to focus immigration enforcement</a> on Democratic-led cities.</p>
<p>“What we’ll do in a city like this is we’ll double down,” Noem said Monday of New York. “We’ll put more agents here. We’ll put more personnel here. We’ll give them more equipment, more training for situations where they may have to go into a dangerous neighborhood where local law enforcement won’t be there to have their backs.”</p>
<p>DHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment on current staffing levels and what an increase would look like.</p>
