<h2 data-gu-name="standfirst">Incident in which migrants were shackled with hands tied of one succession of alleged abuses at jails in Florida</h2>
<p>Migrants at a Miami immigration jail were shackled with their hands tied behind their backs and made to kneel to eat food from styrofoam plates “like dogs”, according to a <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.hrw.org/node/391816">report published on Monday</a> into conditions at three overcrowded south Florida facilities.</p>
<p>The incident at the downtown federal detention center is one of a succession of alleged abuses at Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency (Ice) operated jails in the state since January, chronicled by advocacy groups Human Rights Watch, Americans for Immigrant Justice, and Sanctuary of the South from interviews with detainees.</p>
<p>Dozens of men had been packed into a holding cell for hours, the report said, and denied lunch until about 7pm. They remained shackled with the food on chairs in front of them.</p>
<p>“We had to eat like animals,” one detainee named Pedro said.</p>
<p>Degrading treatment by guards is commonplace in all three jails, the groups say. At the Krome North service processing center in west <a data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/miami">Miami</a>, female detainees were made to use toilets in full view of men being held there, and were denied access to gender-appropriate care, showers, or adequate food.</p>
<p>The jail was so far beyond capacity, some transferring detainees reported, that they were held for more than 24 hours in a bus in the parking lot. Men and women were confined together, and unshackled only when they needed to use the single toilet, which quickly became clogged.</p>
<p>“The bus became disgusting. It was the type of toilet in which normally people only urinate but because we were on the bus for so long, and we were not permitted to leave it, others defecated in the toilet,” one man said.</p>
<p>“Because of this, the whole bus smelled strongly of feces.”</p>
<p>When the group was finally admitted into the facility, they said, many spent up to 12 days crammed into a frigid intake room they christened la hierela - the ice box - with no bedding or warm clothing, sleeping instead on the cold concrete floor.</p>
<p>There was so little space at Krome, and so many detainees, the report says, that every available room was used to hold new arrivals.</p>
<p>“By the time I left, almost all the visitation rooms were full. A few were so full men couldn’t even sit, all had to stand,” Andrea, a female detainee, said.</p>
<p>At the third facility, the Broward transitional center in Pompano Beach, where a 44-year-old Haitian woman, Marie Ange Blaise, <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local/haitian-woman-dies-in-ice-custody-at-facility-in-pompano-beach/3602905/">died in April</a>, detainees said they were routinely denied adequate medical or psychological care.</p>
<p>Some suffered delayed treatment for injuries and chronic conditions, and dismissive or hostile responses from staff, the report said.</p>
<p>In one alleged incident in April at the downtown Miami jail, staff turned off a surveillance camera and a “disturbance control team” brutalized detainees who were protesting a lack of medical attention to one of their number who was coughing up blood. One detainee suffered a broken finger.</p>
<p>All three facilities were severely overcrowded, the former detainees said, a contributory factor in Florida’s decision to quickly build the <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/14/alligator-alcatraz-lawsuits">controversial “Alligator Alcatraz” jail</a> in the Everglades intended to eventually hold up to 5,000 undocumented migrants awaiting deportation.</p>
<p>Immigration detention numbers nationally were at an average of 56,400 per day in mid-June, with almost 72% having no criminal history, according to the report.</p>
<p>The daily average during the whole of 2024 was 37,500, HRW said.</p>
<p>The groups say that the documented abuses reflect inhumane conditions inside federal immigration facilities that have worsened significantly since Trump’s January inauguration and subsequent push to ramp up detentions and deportations.</p>
<p>“The anti-immigrant escalation and enforcement tactics under the <a data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> are terrorizing communities and ripping families apart, which is especially cruel in the state of Florida, which thrives because of its immigrant communities,” said Katie Blankenship, immigration attorney and co-founder of Sanctuary of the South.</p>
<p>“The rapid, chaotic, and cruel approach to arresting and locking people up is literally deadly and causing a human rights crisis that will plague this state and the entire country for years to come.”</p>
