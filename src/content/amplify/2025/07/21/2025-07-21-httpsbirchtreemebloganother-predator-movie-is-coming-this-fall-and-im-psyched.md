  I just watched the excellent Predator: Killer of Killers over the weekend and
  said "Dan Tractenberg is low key one of the best directors working today."
  Little did I know, Dan had another Predator film in the works for this year.
  This appears to be more of a direct sequel

<p>I just watched the <a href="https://mastodon.social/@matt_birchler/114880482375278601?ref=birchtree.me">excellent</a> Predator: Killer of Killers over the weekend and said "Dan Tractenberg is low key one of the best directors working today." Little did I know, Dan had another Predator film in the works for this year. This appears to be more of a direct sequel to the also-excellent Prey, so color me excited.</p>
