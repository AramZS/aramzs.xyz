<p>On 11 April 1942, during one of Hitler’s habitual monologues before his inner circle at the ‘Wolf’s Lair’ headquarters in East Prussia, talk turned to Alfred Rosenberg’s book <em>The Myth of the Twentieth Century</em>. The Nazi theorist’s notoriously impenetrable volume, first published in 1930, had become one of the core ideological texts of the Third Reich, in which Rosenberg proffered, in almost unreadably dense prose, a racial history of the world and argued for the Aryan race’s inherent, yet embattled, superiority. Hitler had personally awarded the author the newly instituted German National Order for Art and Science in January 1938. Yet four years on, Hitler’s private comments were dismissive.
