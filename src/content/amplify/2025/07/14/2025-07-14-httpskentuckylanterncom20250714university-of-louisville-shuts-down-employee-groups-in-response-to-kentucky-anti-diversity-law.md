<p>The University of Louisville has disbanded the UofL Women’s Network and four other employee groups in response to a new state law.</p>
<p>A former president of one of the disbanded groups criticized the action, telling the Kentucky Lantern it goes further than required by the Republican legislature’s new ban on diversity initiatives in public higher education.</p>
<p>Ricky Jones, former president of the UofL Black Faculty/Staff Association and professor of Pan-African Studies, said the employee resource groups provided safe spaces for underrepresented people and allowed them to have “a unified voice to speak to the administration about issues.”</p>
<p>Jones criticized administrators at UofL and other universities for bowing to political pressure on decisions about diversity, equity and inclusion on campus. He predicted the assault on diversity in Kentucky higher education will “get worse before it gets better.”</p>
<p>“Higher education in Kentucky, for Black folk in particular, and for other groups that are being targeted, I think it’s a lost cause at this point, unless something drastic changes. And we don’t have leadership at these schools that are committed to making those types of changes, so we’re in trouble.”</p>
<p>In addition to the groups for Black and women faculty and staff, UofL has eliminated the Asian, Asian American and Pacific Islander Faculty and Staff Association; Hispanic Latino Faculty and Staff Association; and the LGBTQ+ Faculty and Staff Association.</p>
<p>After a review, some university resource groups “were deemed not to be” in compliance with the new law, said UofL spokesperson John Karman.</p>
<p>“Our Employee Success Center will continue to explore ways to support meaningful engagement and to ensure all UofL faculty and staff are valued and supported,” Karman added.</p>
<p>Employee resource groups, or ERGs, were created to “promote a climate of inclusion and provide a place where employees can come together to network, create a strong sense of community, and share their concerns,” according to <a href="https://louisville.edu/careers/employee-groups-associations">a now-removed </a>UofL web page description.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Kentucky’s Republican-controlled General Assembly passed <a href="https://kentuckylantern.com/2025/03/27/ky-bills-ending-dei-in-public-colleges-creating-uncertainty-about-tenures-future-become-law/">House Bill 4</a>, which eliminates diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs and resources at all public universities and colleges within the commonwealth. The universities were directed to enact changes to meet the law’s requirements by June 30, 2025.</p>
<p>UofL and Kentucky’s other public universities <a href="https://kentuckylantern.com/2025/04/15/kentucky-public-universities-are-reviewing-how-to-implement-anti-dei-law/">began reviewing policies</a> in the spring shortly after the law was passed. <a href="https://kentuckylantern.com/2025/05/14/in-wake-of-new-law-eku-swaps-diversity-inclusion-for-viewpoint-neutrality/">Eastern Kentucky University</a> adopted a viewpoint neutrality policy and a resolution saying EKU plans to comply with the law in May. Before the 2025 legislative session, the <a href="https://kentuckylantern.com/2024/08/20/university-of-kentucky-disbanding-its-diversity-office-president-announces/">University of Kentucky</a> and <a href="https://kentuckylantern.com/2024/08/30/a-second-public-university-in-kentucky-closes-its-diversity-office-under-gop-lawmakers-pressure/">Northern Kentucky University</a> disbanded their diversity offices amid scrutiny of DEI programs nationally.</p>
<p>UofL President Gerry Bradley outlined how university administration reviewed programs and resources for compliance with the law in<a href="https://mail.uofl.me/t/r-e-thurkix-nttkjhijyl-d/"> a June 27 email</a> to campus. That included work groups reviewing areas of “position analysis; policy analysis; admissions, financial aid and scholarships; and athletics.” The work group submitted recommendations to UofL’s legal counsel and a Board of Trustees committee. The board considered policy changes during a <a href="https://louisville.app.box.com/s/1y3xpif1p5ox01q1yzpg4ftbmcuga37o">June 26 </a>meeting.</p>
<p>Bradley wrote in his email that decisions to implement changes “were difficult to make in the face of our work to build a culture of belonging — a culture that supports all, that is welcoming of all and reflects our community of care.” He acknowledged that people “have felt hurt and abandoned during this process,” adding that he has “heard your voices and understand the feelings expressed.”</p>
<p>“Let me assure you that I stand by my commitment to support and celebrate all of our community and meet their needs,” Bradley said. “This matter will continue to spark important and necessary conversations about ideas of belonging, success, access to higher education and more.</p>
<p>“With this challenge comes an opportunity for all of us to remain committed to making the University of Louisville a place where we embrace differences and celebrate uniqueness. We will continue to do so with compassionate and steadfast resolve.”</p>
<p>Jones, the UofL professor, said the university’s actions speak louder than the president’s words. He said the state’s new anti-DEI law makes no mention of the kinds of employee groups that UofL ordered dismantled and said administrators chose to be “more aggressive about anti-diversity moves” than the bill required. “Either they agree with the uber-conservative legislators coming out of Frankfort who are doing real and meaningful harm to Black people, LGBTQ people and others” or “they just don’t care,” Jones said.</p>
<p>“I think it’s just a feeling of hopelessness there right now,” he said. “It’s to the point now even those of us who have spoken out over the years, it’s like, ‘Speak out for what?’ This is over.”</p>
