<p>The <a data-tag="bbc" href="https://deadline.com/tag/bbc/">BBC</a>‘s internal review in <em><a data-tag="gaza-how-to-survive-a-warzone" href="https://deadline.com/tag/gaza-how-to-survive-a-warzone/">Gaza: How to Survive a Warzone</a> </em>has found that the documentary breached an editorial rule on accuracy, but the corporation has stopped short of declaring whether any employees will be disciplined over the failure.</p>
<p>Peter Johnston, the BBC’s director of editorial complaints and reviews, has examined what led to the film, which premiered in February, being narrated by the child of a Hamas minister, without this fact being declared to audiences. The film, which was an unsparing portrayal of the chaos in Gaza from the perspective of three young people, was later removed from iPlayer.</p>
<p><em>How to Survive a Warzone</em> was produced by <a href="https://deadline.com/tag/hoyo-films/">Hoyo Films</a>, an independent production company run by Emmy and BAFTA-winning filmmaker <a href="https://deadline.com/tag/jamie-roberts/">Jamie Roberts</a>. Overseeing the film for the BBC were Joanna Carr, head of current affairs, and commissioning editors Gian Quaglieni and Sarah Waldron.</p>

Johnston, a close ally of director-general Tim Davie, went through the process of Maxwellisation, a practice that gives individuals the opportunity to respond to criticisms made in an official report.</p>
<p>The BBC has faced huge pressure from Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy to finalize and publish the report. Nandy has openly questioned why nobody has been fired over the debacle, with one source saying that she is “looking for a scalp.”</p>
<p><a href="https://deadline.com/2025/03/bbc-gaza-doc-tim-davie-samir-shah-1236310205/">BBC chair Samir Shah has previously said the <em>How to Survive a Warzone</em> film was a “dagger to the heart”</a> of the corporation’s impartiality and trustworthiness. “I have a worry that it wasn’t so much the processes that were at fault but that people weren’t doing their job,” Shah added.</p>
