<p>Key Points</p>
<p>What's This?</p>

<p><a data-type="company" href="https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/SCHL">Scholastic</a> <a href="https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/SCHL">SCHL -2.40%decrease; red down pointing triangle</a>, known for “Clifford the Big Red Dog,” “The Baby-sitters Club,” “Harry Potter” and “The Hunger Games,” is trying to write its own comeback story.</p>
<p>The iconic publisher’s stock has fallen by more than 40% over the past year, and its cash pile is dwindling. One of its biggest businesses is mired in a yearslong slump.</p>
<p>Some shareholders have lost faith, and an activist investor disclosed a stake in May. Larger publishing rivals and private-equity investors view it as a possible acquisition target.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, the publisher has unveiled a major restructuring plan intended to streamline its business, leading to the departure of some of its veteran executives. Scholastic is also angling to free up cash by selling and leasing back its Manhattan headquarters building as well as its sprawling distribution facilities in Missouri.</p>
<p>The publisher says it will use some of the proceeds to pay down debt and repurchase shares. Avison Young, a global commercial real-estate firm, values the headquarters property at approximately $443 million, or about three-quarters of the company’s market capitalization.</p>
<p>Scholastic declined to comment on the building’s valuation. Peter Warwick, Scholastic’s chief executive, said the board began discussing how to monetize its real-estate holdings six months ago as the property market improved.</p>
<p>The publisher also put its struggling Education Solutions unit, which offers curriculum materials, school magazines and classroom libraries, under strategic review this past spring.</p>
<p>“This is something they needed to do and they are doing it in a broad sweep, not piecemeal,” said Lorraine Shanley, president of Market Partners International, a publishing-industry consulting firm. Shanley isn’t involved with Scholastic.</p>
<p>Last month, Scholastic merged its school book fairs, book clubs and trade publishing operations into one group under rising star Sasha Quinton, credited for helping to turn around the fairs business after Covid-19. Warwick said the newly combined group will lead to better insights about the books younger readers are snapping up.</p>

<p>Putting one person in charge of those businesses is crucial, said Rose Else-Mitchell, a former president of Scholastic’s Education Solutions unit. “They need to align and overhaul their data, their ordering systems, and update a lot of old infrastructure.”</p>
<p>Activist hedge fund Ananym Capital Management disclosed in May that it owned just under 5% of Scholastic’s common stock. Charlie Penner, who co-founded the fund last year, said the restructuring is “a good start.”</p>
<p>“We see a lot of opportunities for them to enhance their financial strength and improve the company,” he said in an interview. Warwick, whose contract was recently extended through July 2026, said the restructuring was under way before Ananym’s stock purchases.</p>
<h3 data-type="hed">Bestsellers and book fairs</h3>
<p>An outlier within publishing, the mission-driven company championed children’s literacy and donated millions of books to those in need.</p>
<p>Scholastic’s historic successes include “The Magic School Bus” and “Goosebumps” series. “Harry Potter” cemented it as a tastemaker for middle-grade and even adult readers, and more recent wins include Dav Pilkey’s “Dog Man” graphic novels.</p>
<p>The company’s biggest hit of the year is “Sunrise on the Reaping,” the fifth installment in Suzanne Collins’s “Hunger Games” series. It has sold 1.7 million print copies in the U.S., according to Circana BookScan, second only to Mel Robbins’s self-help book “rw-merge-with-siblings<a data-type="link" href="https://www.wsj.com/business/media/mel-robbins-let-them-self-help-guru-rivaling-joe-rogan-63aedd49?mod=article_inline">The Let Them Theory</a>.”</p>
<p>But Scholastic is a complex business that relies on far more than occasional hot titles. Its book fairs—of which there are expected to be 90,000 this year—require tremendous logistical coordination with warehousing (forklift operators), distribution (handlers who pick and pack) and trucking (drivers who interact with schools and even children). Its book clubs take weeks from order to delivery in a market in which <a data-type="company" href="https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/AMZN">Amazon.com</a> puts books on doorsteps in days, if not hours.</p>

<p>A yearslong industrywide decline in print children’s book sales has contributed to its woes. The hardest-hit category so far this year is the segment aimed at readers ages 9 to 12, traditionally a Scholastic sweet spot.</p>
<p>Scholastic was showing signs of struggle even before its longtime leader M. Richard Robinson Jr. unexpected rw-merge-with-siblings<a data-type="link" href="https://www.wsj.com/business/media/succession-drama-grips-scholastic-ceos-sudden-death-an-office-romance-and-a-surprise-will-11627850787?mod=article_inline">death in 2021</a>. Unbeknownst to his family, Robinson Jr. bequeathed his controlling stake in the company to Iole Lucchese, a senior executive and now board chair. Lucchese had a longtime personal relationship with him.</p>
<p>She controls 53.8% of Scholastic’s Class A voting shares, according to the company’s rw-merge-with-siblings<a data-type="link" href="https://investor.scholastic.com/static-files/5fa8c3bd-6522-45aa-b8ee-a6b9f71368e8">August 2024 proxy</a>. Robinson Jr.’s estate is still tied up in court, though. His children haven’t contested the will but asked a judge to let them learn more about its provenance, leaving the door open for litigation.</p>
<p>The family said in a recent court filing that the company and the will’s executors haven’t granted appropriate access to correspondence between Lucchese and Robinson.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Robinson family declined to comment. A spokeswoman for Scholastic and Lucchese declined to comment on the probate case.</p>

<h3 data-type="hed">YouTube gamble</h3>
<p>Shareholders had grown impatient with management after years without a focused revival strategy.</p>
<p>Late last year, FPA Queens Road Small Cap Value Fund, which has held Scholastic stock since 2008, trimmed its stake. The fund rw-merge-with-siblings<a data-type="link" href="https://imonkey-files.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/FPA-QR-small-cap-value-fund-commentary-2024-09-1.pdf">said Scholastic</a> “has never been able to translate its name brand, publishing assets or forays into adjacent markets into consistent earnings.”</p>
<p>Scholastic is betting on new media for help modernizing its business. It paid about $182 million last year for 9 Story Media Group, a Toronto-based animation studio and distributor, to bring its books to screens and meet young audiences on their preferred turf.</p>
<p>Warwick described it as a “key turning point” in Scholastic’s future, with new profit opportunities from production, distribution and licensing.</p>
<p>Subscriber numbers for its dedicated YouTube channels are modest compared with the likes of Peppa Pig and Ryan’s World, but Scholastic says it is generating ad revenue while getting its books in front of a new generation.</p>
<p>“We’re there because the kids and their parents are there,” said Elianne Friend, vice president of digital and distribution at 9 Story Media.</p>
