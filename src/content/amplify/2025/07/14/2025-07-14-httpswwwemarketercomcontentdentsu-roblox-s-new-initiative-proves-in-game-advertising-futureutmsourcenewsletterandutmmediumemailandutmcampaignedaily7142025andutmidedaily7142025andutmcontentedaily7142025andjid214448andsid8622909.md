  The news: Dentsu recently launched Robmix, a new business embedding itself in
  Roblox’s culture and users, per a Dentsu press release. Robmix is a platform
  created with the goal of “discovering and developing the next generation of
  creators” on Roblox and focuses on entertainment opportunities related to
  Roblox users. Our take: Dentsu’s latest move gets ahead of the in-game wave,
  capitalizing on the future of marketing where creators and advertisers are
  increasingly turning to gaming as a critical opportunity to reach audiences
  when they’re most engaged.

title: Dentsu and Roblox’s new initiative proves in-game advertising is the future
---
<p><strong>The news: </strong>Dentsu recently launched Robmix, a new business embedding itself in Roblox’s culture and users, per a Dentsu press release. Robmix is a platform created with the goal of “discovering and developing the next generation of creators” on Roblox and focuses on entertainment opportunities related to users.</p>
<p>The initiative was created in collaboration with Kodansha Creators’ Lab and GeekOut, combining Dentsu’s integrated solutions with GeekOut’s creator reach and Kodansha’s focus on manga.</p>
<ul><li>Robmix offers advertising opportunities around Roblox by developing new content and IP, supporting creators, using existing Roblox properties, and launching merchandise tied to popular games.</li><li>The business is part of Dentsu’s House of Creators initiative, which aims to support the next generation of Roblox creators.</li></ul>
<p><strong>The in-game opportunity: </strong>Dentsu’s decision to embed itself in Roblox is part of a broader push toward in-game marketing, a trend with <u><a data-analytics="Article-Link-Click-https://content-na1.emarketer.com/while-gamings-reach-remains-massive-advertisers-still-hesitate-invest" href="https://content-na1.emarketer.com/while-gamings-reach-remains-massive-advertisers-still-hesitate-invest">massive potential</a></u> that hasn’t been fully capitalized on—and Roblox is the perfect place to start.</p>
<ul><li>Roblox houses <u><a data-analytics="Article-Link-Click-https://chart-na1.emarketer.com/272126/us-unique-visitors-average-minutes-per-visit-robloxcom-by-demographic-april-2025" href="https://chart-na1.emarketer.com/272126/us-unique-visitors-average-minutes-per-visit-robloxcom-by-demographic-april-2025">27.6 million unique visitors in the US</a></u>, and 100 million daily active users worldwide. US users are deeply immersed in the platform, spending an average of 44.5 minutes per visit and providing brands and creators a massive opportunity to reach audiences when they’re most engaged—something that social media doesn’t guarantee.</li></ul>
