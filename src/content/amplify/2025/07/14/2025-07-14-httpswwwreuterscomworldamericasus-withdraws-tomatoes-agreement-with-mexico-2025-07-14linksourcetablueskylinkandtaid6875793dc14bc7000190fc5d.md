  deal suspending an anti-dumping duty investigation on fresh tomatoes from
  Mexico, and that it will issue duties of 17.09% on most of those imports from

<p>WASHINGTON, July 14 (Reuters) - The U.S. Commerce Department said on Monday it was withdrawing from a 2019 deal suspending an anti-dumping duty investigation on fresh tomatoes from <a data-testid="Link" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/mexico/">Mexico</a>, and that it will issue duties of 17.09% on most of those imports from the U.S. neighbor.</p>
<p>Antidumping duties are calculated to measure the percentage by which Mexican tomatoes have been sold in the United States at "unfair prices," the Commerce Department said in its statement.</p>
<p>President <a data-testid="Link" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/donald-trump/">Donald Trump</a> on Saturday had separately threatened to impose a 30% <a data-testid="Link" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/tariffs/">tariff</a> on imports from Mexico starting on August 1, after weeks of negotiations with the major U.S. trading partner failed to reach a comprehensive trade deal.</p>
<p>Mexico's agriculture ministry and economy ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>Mexico said in April it <a data-testid="Link" href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/mexico-hopes-renew-tomato-agreement-with-us-2025-04-15/">was confident</a> that it can renew the tomato agreement with the United States. Washington had said in April that it intended to withdraw from the deal.</p>
<p>The agreement, which regulates Mexican tomato exports to the U.S. in a bid to allow U.S. producers to compete fairly, was first struck in 1996 and last renewed in 2019 to avert an anti-dumping investigation and end a tariff dispute.</p>
<p>U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said on Monday that "for far too long our farmers have been crushed by unfair trade practices that undercut pricing on produce like tomatoes."</p>
<p>According to official figures, Mexico exported $3.3 billion of tomatoes last year, the vast majority to the U.S.</p>
