<h3> "I'm not talking about Sicilian pizza, I'm talking about a slice.‚Äù</h3>
<p>Good morning everyone.</p>
<p>I spent the weekend in Connecticut, exploring <a href="https://tickets.gracefarms.org/events">Grace Farms in New Canaan</a> (very easy train trip) and drinking ros√© on my friend‚Äôs boat. I went for one run, identified three birds, and did not read enough.</p>

<p><em>These responses have been condensed for brevity.</em></p>
<h4>Why do you love New York?</h4>
<p><strong>ZOHRAN MAMDANI:</strong> ‚ÄúBecause it has so many cities in one!‚Äù</p>
<p><strong>ANDREW CUOMO: </strong>‚ÄúI was born here. My father was born here. My grandparents came to New York from Italy, chasing the promise of opportunity, and they found it here, in New York City.</p>
<p>New York City has always been special to me, but not just because of my family or my roots. It‚Äôs special because of what it represents. We are a city of immigrants, of cultures and languages and dreams from every corner of the globe. That diversity doesn‚Äôt just enrich us, it defines us. They say, <em>‚ÄúIf you can make it here, you can make it anywhere.‚Äù</em> And I believe that. Because New Yorkers are a rare kind of tough‚ÄîNew York Tough. We‚Äôre resilient, we‚Äôre relentless, and we rise to every challenge with grit. That‚Äôs what I love most about New York City‚Äîthe people. The people are the energy, the heartbeat, the brilliance of this city. They are the economic engine and the creative force. They are the reason this place is like nowhere else in the world.‚Äù</p>
<p><strong>BRAD LANDER: </strong>‚ÄúFirst Saturdays at the Brooklyn Museum. Fuschka carts. CUNY graduations, at which most of the graduates are first-generation college students. Celebrate Brooklyn summer concerts in Prospect Park. The subway. Shakespeare in the Park. Coney Island with the kids on the last day of school. Walking over High Bridge. The polar bear plunge on New Year‚Äôs Day. The violinists who play in the Endale Arch. The fact that the brilliant new asset managers and entrepreneurs we invest the pension funds with are so likely to live here (or to want to). That you can get any kind of food delivered ‚Äì and that we‚Äôre the first city in the country to guarantee that the deliverista who brings it earns a living wage.‚Äù</p>
<p><strong>SCOTT STRINGER: </strong>‚ÄúBecause it‚Äôs the only place where a kid from Washington Heights could grow up to run for mayor. It‚Äôs the city that raised me and now it‚Äôs raising my kids. What makes New York magic isn‚Äôt the skyline or the celebrity sightings (go Knicks), it‚Äôs the people. I'm talking about the strivers, the folks who move here chasing better opportunities, the artists pouring their souls into their work, the night shift workers keeping this city humming. You couldn't pay me to live anywhere else, but that's precisely why I'm running ‚Äì because this city is pushing too many good people out.‚Äù</p>
<h4><strong>As Manhattan feels more and more like a playground for the rich, where working class New Yorkers serve the upper class, what are your plans to keep New Yorkers affordable for the working class?</strong></h4>
<p><strong>LANDER: </strong>‚ÄúUnlike most politicians who give this issue lip service, I know what it takes to make housing affordable because I‚Äôve actually done it. I‚Äôve built and preserved affordable housing as a nonprofit developer and City Councilmember. The Gowanus rezoning will create 3,000 affordable units and invest in open space and infrastructure. As Comptroller, I saved 35,000 rent-stabilized homes after Signature Bank failed. As Mayor, I‚Äôll build 500,000 homes in 10 years‚Äîincluding 50,000 on city-owned land‚Äîand expand affordable childcare and co-ops to restore the path to ownership.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve already passed laws guaranteeing a living wage for Uber drivers and deliveristas, stable schedules for fast-food workers, and strong protections for freelancers against getting stiffed. As Mayor, I‚Äôll focus on improving job quality for the working-class New Yorkers who make this city run.‚Äù</p>
<p><strong>MAMDANI: </strong>‚ÄúAs Mayor, I will freeze the rent for more than two million rent stabilized tenants, build hundreds of thousands of new permanently affordable homes, make the nation‚Äôs slowest buses fast and free, and deliver universal no cost childcare for every New York family. And unlike any other candidate in this race, I am quite clear about how we‚Äôre going to pay for it: raising taxes on the most profitable corporations and wealthiest individuals. It doesn‚Äôt take much. If we just match the top corporate tax rate of New Jersey and add a flat 2% tax on incomes over $1 million dollar, we can raise enough to pay for this entire agenda and protect our city against Trump‚Äôs vindictive cuts. We‚Äôre the richest city in the richest country. There‚Äôs no excuse for 1 in 4 New Yorkers living in poverty.‚Äù</p>
<p><strong>STRINGER:</strong> ‚ÄúThis isn't a new fight for me; I‚Äôve been in this fight since my days as a Mitchell-Lama tenant organizer. While others talk about affordability, I‚Äôve got the receipts. As Comptroller, I exposed City Hall giving land to luxury developers. As Mayor, I‚Äôll launch Mitchell-Lama 2.0, convert city-owned vacant lots into affordable housing, protect NYCHA, and fully fund childcare. As a parent myself, I know firsthand that childcare costs have gotten out of hand and that the options for our kids get more limited every year. Everyone‚Äôs got good plans, but what makes me different? I‚Äôve done this work, and I‚Äôll keep doing it.‚Äù</p>
<h4><strong>Best slice in the city?</strong></h4>
