<p>The Victoria and Albert Museum published a YouTube video highlighting an art project inspired by the question “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWi5jIyR3Ig">What would your dream museum look like?</a>” The video — featuring ideas ranging from a museum of soil to a museum of kitchen tables — is well worth a watch.</p>
<p>This got me thinking: what would my dream museum look like? An idea came to mind: a high street museum of the World Wide Web.</p>
<p>When I was learning about HTML in school, we did an exercise where we glued pieces of paper with HTML elements written on them to a piece of card. We assembled HTML documents by hand. The exercise helped us learn that HTML has a structure; tags have meaning. Then, we went onto the computer and typed up our HTML. This exercise was a bridge between the physical and digital worlds. That is to say, I learned HTML in both worlds.</p>
<p>What would a physical museum of the web look like? There could be exhibits showcasing foundational HTML documents — the HTML behind the first web page, behind early web directories, behind web pages today. There could be exhibits showcasing the history of accessibility web technologies. Exhibits on animation and CSS and JavaScript and multimedia. Exhibits could show histories, turning points, creative projects <sup><a href="https://jamesg.blog/2025/07/14/museum-of-the-world-wide-web#1">1</a></sup>, and help us imagine futures for the web. There could be labs that help people write HTML and CSS; tutorials that walk through fun projects for all ages.</p>
<p>There could also be exhibits on the culture of the web — the evolution of community and means of interacting with each other.</p>
<p>The history of the web and modern technology is intertwined with the era in which we live today. We use the web every day. The web is an amazing tool for creative expression. It is also a tool that can be wielded to deceive. Documenting, analysing, and providing a space to contemplate these dualities are precisely what museums are good at, and what we need as the web inhabits a such a large place in our communities.</p>
<p>In my mind, I see this as a “high street museum.” I mention this because the first place that came to mind as an ideal home for this museum would be my home town. Like most high streets in the UK, shops are closing one after another; there are more empty spaces as the years go by. Given the web itself is global, it seems fitting that a museum of the web would be global too — each one could have both permanent collections and also region-specific histories of the web. I am confident there is a Scottish history of the web to document.</p>
<p>Furthermore, regions could use the museum as a space to think about how to shape the web according to their needs. Perhaps such a museum could be a gathering space for a community wiki; a place where local newspapers can go to set up their websites; a wealth of resources for students who are interested in learning more about the web and its potential.</p>

<p>The Phoenix centre in Leicester, England is running a “<a href="https://www.phoenix.org.uk/events/paint-by-style-sheet/">Paint by Style Sheet</a>” exhibit (ends Sunday, July 24th, 2025) that “celebrates innovative approaches to digital artistry, demonstrating how the logic of web development could be reimagined as compelling visual expressions.” Among the exhibits is “<a href="https://codepen.io/ivorjetski/pen/xxGYWQG">Pure CSS Landscape - An Evening in Southwold</a>” by Ben Evans, a landscape drawn entirely with CSS. I am fascinated and delighted by this project. Thank you to <a href="https://marksuth.dev">Mark</a> for telling me about this project.</p>
