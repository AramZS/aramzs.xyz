title: Slash death manifesto
---
<p>I love personal websites. <em>Any</em> personal sites: professional and fun, simple and silly, creative and polished. It makes me happy when by accessing <code>/about</code> and <code>/now</code> I can get to know a person and answer a lot of questions for myself about their personality before I even get to write ‘Hi!’. I also use my website as a profile, a portfolio and an independent platform for my once-voiced information that can be easily referenced many times over.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://slashpages.net/">slash pages</a> are good, I’ve learnt a lot of new <a href="https://toby3d.me/en/slashes/">page standards lately that I’m happy to reproduce them on my site</a>. But they’re about the author’s past, what’s happening to them now, and occasionally plans for the not-too-distant future. It seems to me that we are missing the fact that sites about us will not be updated and live forever. Neither we nor our audience, to whom we broadcast our sites in one way or another on the Internet, are ready for that.</p>
<p>So I propose a new standard – <strong><code>/death</code></strong>: slash-page with instructions for family and friends in case of site owner demise.</p>
<p>By default, I propose that <strong>this slash page be accessible only by direct link</strong>. You can also block robots to index that page. That way, when you can no longer change access to it yourself, your inner circle still can inspect that page. If you want, they can also publish this link in your social media and your personal website to notify your audience. Let trusted people know about it ahead of time so they know where to turn. Remember to strike a balance between detail for loved ones and privacy from others, as this page should not be protected.</p>
<p>I’ve published <a href="https://toby3d.me/en/death/">my <code>/death</code> page</a>, which you can explore as an example. You are not obliged to follow its structure and are free to design your version of the page as you wish. Here are some questions and tips to get you started.</p>
<p>If you have a will, state its existence, the date it was last updated, its expiry date, and where and from whom you need to get it. Basically, having a will that can be easily retrieved by your family members on X day – the most important thing you can offer them. Although the <code>/death</code> page takes precedence over any oral or written agreements, a will is still the legal document with the highest force. It is where you should start if at all possible.</p>
<p>Take care of the tools and methods for handing over the keys of your digital garden. Do you want your server and website leases to extend as far as they can, or do you want your digital footprint to cut off with you? Who will you give your media libraries to for future use? What about draft blog posts and repositories? Do you need to archive your correspondence and photos? You may not have previously considered the risks of locking all your digital legacy away from the world. Working on the text for <code>/death</code> – a good reason to think about how to avoid this.</p>
<p>Digital stuff may disappear without a trace, but beyond that there are also social and material stuff. Who will be handling the money after you? Will your ex-partners have to be notified? Who will you leave your children to? What to do with your body? These questions can be daunting for you. But right now, it’s not too late to answer them and close the gestalts.</p>
<p>Finally, think about the message. Not an instruction, but a “last word” that you would do and say at the ceremony. Maybe the most heartfelt thing you would attach along with your will. Then address your audience who have been watching and interacting with you. Warn them of the coming changes or simply thank them. As acquaintances, friends and colleagues, they too deserves to know what has happened so they doesn’t find herself in an awkward situation.</p>
<p>Hopefully my naive initiative will resonate with some site owner and they create they own hidden <code>/death</code> slash-page. It’s not another reflection warm-up and hardly “makes a fun” like <a href="https://toby3d.me/en/chipotle/"><code>/chipotle</code></a>. But a couple of tens of kilobytes sticking out into the net is worth it to save a lot of effort, time and nerves to those you care about.</p>
