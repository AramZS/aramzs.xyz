  Sunshine State Attorney General James Uthmeier is the real brains behind this
  notorious migrant detention camp in the Everglades. The more barbarities that
  emerge, the brighter his star will no doubt shine.

<p>The other day, Stephen Miller <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/red-states-consider-alligator-alcatraz-spinoffs-wh-urges-them-follow-desantis-lead-lots-bears">went on Fox News</a> and offered a plea that got surprisingly little attention given its highly toxic and unnerving implications. Miller urged politicians in GOP-run states to build their own versions of “Alligator Alcatraz,” the state-run immigration detention facility that officials just opened in the Florida Everglades.</p>
<p>“We want every governor of a red state, and if you are watching tonight: pick up the phone, call DHS, work with us to build facilities in your state,” Miller said, in a reference to the Department of Homeland Security. Critically, Miller added, such states could then work with the federal government by supplying much-needed detention beds, helping President Trump “get the illegals out.”</p>
<p>Keep all that in mind as we introduce you to one James Uthmeier.</p>
<p>Uthmeier, the attorney general of Florida and a longtime ally of Governor Ron DeSantis, is widely described in the state as the brains behind “Alligator Alcatraz.” Peter Schorsch, the publisher of <a href="https://floridapolitics.com/">Florida Politics</a>, sums him up this way: “In Uthmeier, DeSantis found his own Stephen Miller.”</p>
<p>Uthmeier is indeed a homegrown Florida version of Miller: Only 37 years old, he brings great precociousness to the jailing of migrants. Like Miller, he is obscure and little-known relative to the influence he’s amassing. Also like Miller, he is fluent in MAGA’s reliance on the spectacle of inhumanity and barbarism.</p>
<p>“You don’t need to invest that much in the perimeter,” Uthmeier said of “Alligator Alcatraz” in a <a href="https://x.com/AGJamesUthmeier/status/1935741644101374271">slick video</a> he recently narrated about the complex, which featured heavy-metal guitar riffs right out of a combat-cosplay video game. “People get out, there’s not much waiting for them other than alligators and pythons. Nowhere to go, nowhere to hide.”</p>
<p>Any migrant who dares escape just might get devoured alive by an animal—one animal eating another. Dehumanization is <i>so thrilling</i>!</p>
<p>The real-world “Alligator Alcatraz” is already gaining notoriety for its very real cruelties. After Democratic lawmakers visited over the weekend, they <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/allowed-lawmakers-split-conditions-alligator-alcatraz-rcna218498">sharply denounced</a> the scenes they’d witnessed of migrants <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/12/us/alligator-alcatraz-lawmaker-tour-conditions">packed into cages</a> under inhumane conditions. Meanwhile, detainees and family members have <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/families-immigrant-detainees-allege-horrible-conditions-alligator-alca-rcna217743">sounded alarms</a> about worm-infested food and blistering heat. And the <i>Miami Herald</i> <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/immigration/article310541810.html">reports that an unnervingly large percentage</a> of the detainees lack criminal convictions.</p>
<p>But Uthmeier is getting feted <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6374871251112">on Fox News</a> and <a href="https://x.com/AGJamesUthmeier/status/1940205995344404722">other right wing media</a> for this new experiment in spite of such notorieties—or perhaps because of them. There’s good reason to think more red state politicians will seek to create their own versions of “Alligator Alcatraz” or get in on this action in other ways—and that more young Republican politicians will see it as a path to MAGA renown and glory.</p>
<p>For one thing, the money is now there. Buried in the big budget bill that Trump recently signed is a little-noticed provision that immigration advocates increasingly fear could fund more complexes like this one. It makes $3.5 billion available to “eligible states” and their agencies for numerous immigration-related purposes, including the “temporary detention of aliens.”</p>
<p>When Miller told GOP politicians to follow Uthmeier by collaborating with federal officials to develop new versions of “Alligator Alcatraz,” he was probably talking about this slush fund. State officials can try to tap into it for building out such facilities. “For Republican states across the country that want to copy the ‘Alligator Alcatraz’ model, this bill will give them that money,” immigration analyst <a href="https://austinkocher.substack.com/">Austin Kocher</a> tells me.</p>
<p>What’s more, red state politicians are paying attention. Fox News <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/red-states-consider-alligator-alcatraz-spinoffs-wh-urges-them-follow-desantis-lead-lots-bears">contacted numerous gubernatorial offices</a> to ask if they intend to take up Miller’s invitation. The responses were positive, with many eagerly touting plans for detention complexes. While it’s unclear if these will resemble “Alligator Alcatraz,” the underlying impulse is clear: Many red states want to expand state-run detention efforts. And again: The money is there.</p>
<p>This is a bad development. “Alligator Alcatraz” should not be the model for the future of migrant detention in much of the United States.</p>
<p>Here’s why. The facility is funded and operated by the state of Florida, but the state can use it to detain undocumented people under a federal program that <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/03/us/alligator-alcatraz-florida-lawmakers-visit">allows</a> ICE to authorize local law enforcement to carry out immigration crackdowns. That puts “Alligator Alcatraz” in a grey area: Local law enforcement agencies are using it to carry out Trump’s immigration detention agenda even as ICE does not run the facility.</p>
<p>Lauren-Brooke Eisen of the Brennan Center, who specializes in criminal justice, points to a toxic combination built into the idea of more versions of this arrangement. ICE detention is subject to federal oversight. But huge influxes of federal money for migrant detention—as in Trump’s new bill—could create new incentives for states to ramp up their own detention efforts. Yet because “Alligator Alcatraz” is a new experiment, she says, it’s unclear what sort of federal oversight future imitation efforts would receive, even if they get some federal money.</p>
<p>“What will access to counsel look like for detainees?” Eisen asks. “What will access to family members look like? It’s difficult to imagine state-run facilities where conditions and due process are prioritized.”</p>
<p>Illustrating the point, when a reporter <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/families-immigrant-detainees-allege-horrible-conditions-alligator-alca-rcna217743">recently asked</a> ICE for comment on what’s going on inside “Alligator Alcatraz,” ICE said, well, it isn’t their facility. In other words, the federal government is not responsible for what happens inside those walls—even as Miller and Trump call on other states to build more of them.</p>
<p>Which brings us back to Uthmeier and the future of MAGA.</p>
<p>It’s easy to see Uthmeier and his “Alligator Alcatraz” becoming a model for other young Republicans seeking a route into MAGA celebrity. Consider <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/miami/news/james-uthmeier-florida-attorney-general/">his career trajectory</a>: It’s fairly conventional establishment-Republican stuff. A native of Destin, a small beach city in the deep red Florida panhandle, he earned a law degree from Georgetown and then worked for the Commerce Department in the first Trump administration—and then for the ultra-establishment D.C. law firm Jones Day.</p>
<p>Uthmeier has also <a href="https://fedsoc.org/contributors/james-uthmeier">made appearances</a> at the conservative Federalist Ssociety, which is as establishment-conservative as it gets. He joined DeSantis’s first administration as a senior legal adviser, and then got appointed as attorney general when the slot was vacated by the appointment of former AG Ashley Moody to now-Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s Senate seat.</p>
<p>All in all, it’s in some ways a conventional path to GOP success. In fact, Uthmeier actually has a track record of <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/07/11/uthmeier-desantis-trump-florida-alligator-alcatraz-00447141">criticizing</a> Trump in the past on things like Covid-19 and abortion. But J.D. Vance survived such heresies, and now, in the party that Trump remade, Uthmeier apparently recognizes that “Alligator Alcatraz” is his big ticket. It’s a reminder that in today’s GOP, the MAGA and older-line Republican establishments are bleeding into one another—and that getting attached to such an idea is a path to national MAGA stardom.</p>
<p>Put another way, in the cut-throat world of the MAGA attention economy, association with things like “Alligator Alcatraz” can carry enormous weight. It’s hard for people who don’t swim in MAGA’s rancid information currents to grasp, but when Trump recently <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/07/01/nx-s1-5453078/trump-alligator-alcatraz-visit-migrant-detention-center">toured</a> the facility with DeSantis, it was a huge MAGA propaganda coup for the Florida governor (yes, he apparently still harbors national ambitions).</p>
<p>Indeed, one person who very much noticed this was apparently Uthmeier himself. According to one Florida operative in touch with Uthmeier’s staff, there’s considerable sensitivity in his inner circle over who is getting credit for “Alligator Alcatraz,” with some worrying that Uthmeier isn’t reaping enough of it.</p>
<p>Uthmeier needn’t worry, however. When Trump toured the facility, he <a href="https://news.wfsu.org/state-news/2025-07-03/alligator-alcatraz-a-political-boost-for-ag-uthmeier-florida-politicos-say">said</a> of Uthmeier: “That guy’s got a future.” In this, the MAGA God King himself gave a <a href="https://www.wusf.org/politics-issues/2025-07-04/alligator-alcatraz-a-political-boost-for-ag-uthmeier-florida-politicos-say">big boost</a> to Uthmeier’s 2026 electoral bid to keep his appointed AG role, which will be a platform for even higher ambitions. And if more barbarities emerge from “Alligator Alcatraz,” as they surely will, his MAGA future will only get that much brighter.</p>
