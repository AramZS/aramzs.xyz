<p>Community activists in San Francisco are rallying to support Hilary Rivers, an immigrant drag queen who was arrested by ICE agents after an asylum hearing nearly two weeks ago — one of the latest LGBTQ+ victims of the Trump administration’s campaign for mass deportations.</p>
<p>Rivers fled his home in Guatemala due to “traumatic and severe” persecution for being gay, as the <a data-event-boundary="click" data-event-click='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-in-view='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-include-experiments="true" data-offer-url="https://www.sfchronicle.com/sf/article/drag-performer-detained-ice-20399122.php" href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/sf/article/drag-performer-detained-ice-20399122.php"><em>San Francisco Chronicle</em></a> reported last week. (His legal name is not being widely reported to protect his confidentiality, advocates told the nonprofit news platform <a data-event-boundary="click" data-event-click='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-in-view='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-include-experiments="true" data-offer-url="https://48hills.org/2025/06/drag-performer-taken-by-ice-morning-after-pride-week-pageant/" href="https://48hills.org/2025/06/drag-performer-taken-by-ice-morning-after-pride-week-pageant/">48Hills.org</a> shortly following the drag performer’s arrest.) On June 26, Rivers attended a scheduled asylum hearing, where the government’s motion to dismiss his case was denied; Rivers was then arrested by ICE agents as he left the courtroom. That combination — in which the government attempts to dismiss an asylum case, then immediately arrests the asylum seeker for deportation — has become an <a href="https://apnews.com/article/immigration-court-arrests-ice-deportation-99d822cdc93ae7dc26026c27895d5ea1">increasingly common tactic</a> for U.S. immigration police in the past several months, and one that is sometimes conducted with <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/06/12/nx-s1-5409403/trump-immigration-courts-arrests">cooperation from courthouses</a> themselves.</p>
<p>Rivers is now believed to be held in Golden State Annex, an ICE detention center in Bakersfield. Since his arrest, activist and advocacy groups like SF Pride and the San Francisco Immigrant Legal Defense Collaborative (SFILDC) have lobbied for Rivers’ release and assurances of his safety while in detention. Advocates asked for ICE’s San Francisco office to be “flooded” with phone calls following Rivers’ arrest, per 48Hills, and San Francisco nonprofit art collective Galeria de la Raza <a data-event-boundary="click" data-event-click='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-in-view='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-include-experiments="true" data-offer-url="https://missionlocal.org/2025/07/mission-residents-write-to-drag-performer-arrested-by-ice-were-with-you/" href="https://missionlocal.org/2025/07/mission-residents-write-to-drag-performer-arrested-by-ice-were-with-you/">hosted a letter-writing session</a> last Monday for community members to send messages of support. Rivers’ “primary concern is for people to understand that he was doing things following the law and that he was not a criminal,” the gallery’s director Ani Rivera said at the event, according to <a data-event-boundary="click" data-event-click='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-in-view='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-include-experiments="true" data-offer-url="https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/sf-drag-queen-detained-ice-20421750.php" href="https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/sf-drag-queen-detained-ice-20421750.php">SFGate</a>.</p>
<p>“We came to this country truly seeking opportunity. We are members of the LGBTQ community, and closing the door like that is not only unfair but disheartening,” said Claudia Cabrera, program director at the Instituto Familiar de la Raza, at the letter-writing session. “There are really no words to describe the feeling this provokes in us as immigrants and those who have been in Hilary’s shoes.”</p>
<p>The night before his arrest, Rivers had performed at Miss &amp; Mr. Safe Latino, a beloved queer community pageant which began during the height of the HIV/AIDS crisis and celebrated its 30th anniversary this year.</p>
<p>“There’s not a more textbook case of what asylum was created for than a case like his,” SFILDC legal director Milli Atkinson told the <a data-event-boundary="click" data-event-click='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-in-view='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-include-experiments="true" data-offer-url="https://www.sfchronicle.com/sf/article/drag-performer-detained-ice-20399122.php" href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/sf/article/drag-performer-detained-ice-20399122.php"><em>Chronicle</em></a>, calling Rivers’ arrest “a complete, flagrant violation of what our asylum system was built on.”</p>
<p>“To have them take him away from his community during Pride Week, when he’s fleeing persecution for his queer identity, and when he had just participated in that pageant […] is just horrific to me, is just a disgrace, and people should really be outraged and ashamed by what our government is doing,” Atkinson added.</p>
<p>LGBTQ+ immigrants and asylum seekers have faced dehumanization and persecution from ICE since the agency’s founding in 2003, though those harms <a href="https://www.them.us/story/ice-is-still-subjecting-trans-asylum-seekers-to-life-threatening-conditions">escalated significantly</a> over the past decade. One of the most high-profile cases in President Donald Trump’s second term so far has been that of <a href="https://www.them.us/story/andry-hernandez-romero-gay-makeup-artist-venezuela-el-salvador-detained">Andry Hernandez Romero</a>, a gay Venezuelan asylum seeker who was “disappeared” to a notorious El Salvador megaprison in March. Hernandez’s family told <a data-event-boundary="click" data-event-click='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-in-view='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-include-experiments="true" data-offer-url="https://www.nbcnews.com/video/shorts/the-family-of-andry-hernandez-romero-a-gay-asylum-seeker-from-venezuela-has-not-heard-from-him-since-he-was-sent-to-el-salvador-242677317954" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/video/shorts/the-family-of-andry-hernandez-romero-a-gay-asylum-seeker-from-venezuela-has-not-heard-from-him-since-he-was-sent-to-el-salvador-242677317954">NBC News</a> last week that they still have not heard from him in nearly four months.</p>
