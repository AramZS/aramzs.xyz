<p>A data analysis of animal gender in children’s books</p>
<p>When I spend time with kids, I become hyperconscious of my word choices. “Look at Mr. Frog in the pond. Doesn’t he look grumpy?” Why did I say <em>Mr.</em> Frog? Why did I say <em>he</em>?</p>
<p>Where do these gendered presumptions even come from, and how pervasive are they? Is it common to assume that a frog is a “he?” What about a bear, or a bird, or a cat, or a pig?</p>
<p>I wanted to know: <strong>Which animals do we gender, and why?</strong></p>
<details> <h2>Finding the Data</h2><p>To answer this question, we started with arguably the richest source of anthropomorphized animals in human culture: children’s picture books.</p><p>First, we identified the most popular English-language kids’ books on Goodreads that feature at least one anthropomorphized animal, focusing on the most rated titles published since 1950, plus some older and still highly rated classics.<sup><a href="https://pudding.cool/2025/07/kids-books/#footnote-1">1</a></sup> We read about 30 per decade—around 300 books in total—from which we noted the gender of any anthropomorphized animal character who was important to the story.</p><figure> <img alt="A mouse looking satisfied, sitting against an empty glass of milk. The text says “When he’s finished, he’ll ask for a glass of milk.”" src="https://pudding.cool/2025/07/kids-books/assets/images/ifyougiveamouseacookie@2x.jpg"/> He/him<img alt='An illustration from  &lt;em&gt;Itty-Bitty Kitty-Corn&lt;/em&gt; (2021) showing Kitty, a fluffy pink kitten with a yellow-and-orange paper unicorn horn. Kitty has green eyes and a purple bow around her neck. The page contains four drawings of Kitty in different playful poses, mostly standing, prancing, and galloping. The text reads: "Kitty stands tall. She prances on her pawed, clawed, unicorn hooves. She gallops on her eensy-weensy unicorn legs."' src="https://pudding.cool/2025/07/kids-books/assets/images/itty-bitty-kitty-corn-zoom@2x.png"/> She/her<img alt='A large, colorful caterpillar  from &lt;em&gt;The Very Hungry Caterpillar&lt;/em&gt; (1969) with a red head, yellow-rimmed green eyes, purple antennae, and a segmented green body stands on stubby brown legs. Above the caterpillar, the text reads: "Now he wasn’t hungry any more – and he wasn’t a little caterpillar any more. He was a big, fat caterpillar."' src="https://pudding.cool/2025/07/kids-books/assets/images/hungry-caterpillar@2x.png"/> He/him <figcaption>A large, colorful caterpillar from &lt;em&gt;The Very Hungry Caterpillar&lt;/em&gt; (1969) with a red head, yellow-rimmed green eyes, purple antennae, and a segmented green body stands on stubby brown legs. Above the caterpillar, the text reads: "Now he wasn’t hungry any more – and he wasn’t a little caterpillar any more. He was a big, fat caterpillar."</figcaption> </figure><details> <p>For the purposes of our study, we were interested in fictional animal characters, and the human conceptions of gender foisted upon them. Even so, determining the gender of animal characters is tricky—both because gender is one of the most complex, fluid aspects of our lives, and because our perceptions of gender are often shaped by cultural biases and assumptions.</p><p>For example, in Sandra Boynton’s <em>But Not the Hippopotamus</em> (1982), a bear and a hare appear in bow ties—a traditionally masculine accessory—but are never explicitly gendered in the text. Are they boys?</p><p>To avoid projecting our own assumptions based on clothing, visual cues, or names, we decided to go with a conservative approach. We only recorded how animal characters were referenced in the text: with feminine (she/her), masculine (he/him), or neutral (it, they/them) pronouns; with a gendered honorific (e.g., Mr., Ms.) or familial role (e.g., brother, mother); or simply by their animal name (e.g., the frog) or a character name.</p></details><p>We were also curious about how people ordinarily assign gender to animals. Authors make deliberate choices about the characters they create. Contemporary authors might be especially intentional about subverting gender stereotypes.</p><p>To dig into these tendencies, we designed an experiment. We asked more than 1,300 survey respondents to complete a story that began:</p><p>“And then the <strong>bear</strong> said, ‘I must go to the river.’ Upon arriving…”</p><p>We randomly swapped in one of seven animals: bear, bird, cat, pig, duck, mouse, or dog. We didn’t tell participants what the experiment was about.<sup><a href="https://pudding.cool/2025/07/kids-books/#footnote-2">2</a></sup></p><p>Each response gave us a window into how the storyteller imagined the animal, especially whether they assigned the animal a gender.</p><h2>Which animals skew male vs. female?</h2><p>First up: children’s books. After filtering the data to focus on animals who were explicitly gendered (she/her or he/him) and appeared in at least 10 different books, only a few animals were more consistently gendered female: birds, ducks, and cats.</p><figure> <img alt="A bird is falling downward. The text says, “She fell.”" src="https://pudding.cool/2025/07/kids-books/assets/images/melfell@2x.jpg"/> She/her<img alt='A black-and-white illustration from a children’s book shows a wide-eyed kitten sitting on a windowsill at night, with a bug stuck to her tongue.

The text below reads: "But Kitten only ended up with a bug on her tongue. Poor Kitten!"' src="https://pudding.cool/2025/07/kids-books/assets/images/kitten-first-full-moon-bug@2x.jpg"/> She/her<img alt="An illustration from Dr. Seuss’s &lt;em&gt;Horton Hatches the Egg&lt;/em&gt; showing Mayzie the bird leaping toward a tree branch as the egg in the nest begins to crack open. The egg is large and orange with white spots, and it's surrounded by motion lines and bursts indicating the moment of hatching. Below, the text reads: “But it’s MINE!” screamed the bird, when she heard the egg crack." src="https://pudding.cool/2025/07/kids-books/assets/images/horton-bird-mine@2x.jpg"/> She/her<img alt="An illustration from the children’s book &lt;em&gt;Little Bear&lt;/em&gt; (1957) showing a duck and a hen sitting upright in chairs at a dining table covered with a fringed tablecloth. There is a potted flower and a jar in the center of the table. The accompanying text reads: “Thank you, Duck,” says Little Bear.  “Yes, I am making Birthday Soup. Will you stay and have some with us?” “Thank you, yes, thank you,” says Duck. And she sits down to wait." src="https://pudding.cool/2025/07/kids-books/assets/images/duck-little-bear@2x.png"/> She/her <figcaption>A black-and-white illustration from a children’s book shows a wide-eyed kitten sitting on a windowsill at night, with a bug stuck to her tongue.

The text below reads: "But Kitten only ended up with a bug on her tongue. Poor Kitten!"</figcaption> </figure><p>The rest—frog, wolf, fox, elephant, dog, monkey, bear, rabbit, mouse, and pig—skew male. Because so much of our worldview is shaped by our environment when we are young, automatically reaching for he after “look at the frog!” starts to make some sense. After all, that’s what the books say.</p><figure> <img alt='An illustration from &lt;em&gt;It Fell From the Sky&lt;/em&gt; (2021) showing a realistic frog crouched among tall dandelions and leafy plants. The frog’s tongue is extended toward a colorful object on the ground: a shiny green and yellow marble. The marble is the only part of the image in color. Below, the text reads: "A Frog assumed it was a gumdrop. He didn’t like how it tasted."' src="https://pudding.cool/2025/07/kids-books/assets/images/frog_it-fell-from-the-sky@2x.jpg"/> He/him<img alt="An illustration from &lt;em&gt;Something's Wrong!: A Bear, a Hare, and Some Underwear&lt;/em&gt; (2021) showing Anders, a green rabbit with wide eyes and a surprised expression staring at a bear, Jeff, wearing only white underpants. The text, presumably from the rabbit’s inner monologue, reads: “Oh boy. Should I tell him? Yes? You really think he can handle it? Why am I even asking you? Who are you? All right. Welp. Here we go . . .”" src="https://pudding.cool/2025/07/kids-books/assets/images/something's-wrong@2x.jpg"/> He/him<img alt='An illustrated page from &lt;em&gt;The Three Pigs&lt;/em&gt; (2001) showing a wolf with eyes closed, cheeks puffed, and paws raised as he blows hard. Straw flies through the air, surrounding a pig who is tumbling backward out of the panel. The narration at the top reads: "So the wolf huffed, and he puffed, and he blew the house in…" The pig, mid-air and startled, has a speech bubble that says: "Hey! He blew me right out of the story!"' src="https://pudding.cool/2025/07/kids-books/assets/images/wolf-three-pigs@2x.png"/> He/him<img alt='An illustration from &lt;em&gt;Clifford’s Halloween&lt;/em&gt; (1966) showing Clifford the Big Red Dog dressed as Santa Claus. He wears a red Santa hat and has a big white beard tied around his face. A child rides on his back. Clifford carries a sack of toys in his mouth that are tumbling out. Two bundled-up children run toward him in the snow. The caption reads: "At Christmas, Clifford makes a very good Santa. He already has a red coat."' src="https://pudding.cool/2025/07/kids-books/assets/images/clifford@2x.png"/> He/him <figcaption>An illustration from &lt;em&gt;Something's Wrong!: A Bear, a Hare, and Some Underwear&lt;/em&gt; (2021) showing Anders, a green rabbit with wide eyes and a surprised expression staring at a bear, Jeff, wearing only white underpants.

Here we go . . .”</figcaption> </figure><p>In the survey responses to our experiment, no animal tilted more female than male. The animal gender usage order almost identically mirrored those from the children’s books.</p><figure>  “And then the <strong>bear</strong> said, ‘I must go to the river.’ Upon arriving…”<br/> <blockquote><strong>he</strong> realised he forgot his phone home or maybe on the bus. This is when panic shot through him, not because he had an expensive phone but because he just reached level 6000 on Candy Crush and now he had to start all over. As he calmed down he started to retrace his steps…<br/><br/><em>-Survey Respondent (20s)</em></blockquote> </figure><h2>Mostly he, rarely she, and sometimes It</h2><p>In the children’s books, male animal characters appeared twice as often as female characters. Male pronouns appeared nearly three times as often in the survey results—particularly striking because there were more women respondents.</p><p>In the children’s books, gender neutral language (it or they)–whether intentional or not–was not common. Only two percent of the animals were described as it. They/them was almost never used.</p><figure> <img alt='An illustration from &lt;em&gt;The Rabbit Listened&lt;/em&gt; (2018) that shows two scenes. In the top half, a small brown rabbit approaches a scattered pile of yellow toy blocks. The text reads: "But it moved closer, and closer." In the bottom half, a child named Taylor with curly dark hair, wearing teal striped pajamas, sits curled up on the ground looking sad. The rabbit now sits quietly beside Taylor, leaning in. The text beside them reads: "Until Taylor could feel its warm body."' src="https://pudding.cool/2025/07/kids-books/assets/images/rabbit-listened-it@2x.png"/> it<img alt='An illustration from &lt;em&gt;Are You My Mother?&lt;/em&gt; (1960) showing a wide-eyed brown kitten standing silently, staring at a small bird who is looking up at it with an open beak. The kitten has bright yellow eyes and a neutral expression. The text reads: "The kitten just looked and looked. It did not say a thing."' src="https://pudding.cool/2025/07/kids-books/assets/images/kitten-it-are-you-my-mother@2x.png"/> it<img alt='A vibrant illustration shows a firefly with red wings and a green face flying through a twilight sky.

'Shaggy beast,' it growled, 'I fell into an ice floe and am chilled to the bone. Can you help me?' Cozy was happy to invite the wolverine in, but added to the house rules. 'Quiet voices, gentle thumping, claws to yourself, no biting, and no pouncing.'&quot;" src="https://pudding.cool/2025/07/kids-books/assets/images/wolverine-cozy-zoom@2x.jpg"/> it <figcaption>An illustration from &lt;em&gt;Are You My Mother?&lt;/em&gt; (1960) showing a wide-eyed brown kitten standing silently, staring at a small bird who is looking up at it with an open beak. The kitten has bright yellow eyes and a neutral expression. The text reads: "The kitten just looked and looked. It did not say a thing."</figcaption> </figure><p>There was a lot more gender neutrality and ambiguity in the survey responses—though, since their stories were much shorter than a typical kid’s book, it was perhaps easier to maintain gender neutrality. While he/him was still the most frequently used pronoun in the survey results, many respondents referred to the animal by name (26%), by it (17%), or by they/them (3%).</p> These are the 821 animals from children’s books that we included in our analysis.

<details> <p>Why are animal gender ratios so lopsided in children’s books? And why are female animals just as absent in the stories produced by the survey respondents?</p><p>Perhaps because the main character of a story is still assumed to be male by default—and maybe especially when the story’s setting lacks explicit social cues.</p><p>This aligns with <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2776222?seq=1">decades</a> <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00299282">of</a> <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11199-006-9128-6">research</a>—much of it quantitative—showing that male characters dominate children’s literature and media. A <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0891243211398358">2011 study</a> found that gender disparity was actually more pronounced for animal protagonists.</p><figure> <figcaption>The classic 1987 study, <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00287623">“The Three Bears Are All Boys: Mothers' Gender Labeling of Neutral Picture Book Characters,”</a> (1987) by Judy S. DeLoache, Deborah J. Cassidy, and C. Jan Carpenter.</figcaption></figure><p>But why do we gender <em>certain</em> animals in <em>certain</em> ways more than others—like cats, birds, and ladybugs as females, or bears, wolves, dogs, and frogs as males?</p><figure> <figcaption>A cat named Pajama (she/her) from <em>A Day in the Life of Marlon Bundo </em> (2018), written by Jill Twiss and illustrated by E.G.

Cats were linked to goddesses in ancient Egypt, to witches in medieval Europe, and to <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZP8jNLvGB/">TikTok girlfriends today.</a></p><figure> <figcaption>This ancient Greek vase (circa 480-470 BCE) depicts a scene from The Odyssey, where the Sirens are represented as birds with women’s heads. Photo courtesy: <a href="https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/G_1843-1103-31">British Museum</a></figcaption></figure><p>Birds, too, carry associations with femininity. You can think of the caged bird as a metaphor for constrained womanhood, or all the women who get transformed into birds in Greek mythology.</p><p>These associations are embedded in the slang we use everyday, even across languages like English and Spanish. As scholar Irene López Rodríguez <a href="https://raco.cat/index.php/CLR/article/view/226358">reminds us</a>, we call men “studs, bucks, wolves, toros (bulls), zorros (foxes) and linces (lynxes),” and we call women “chick, bird, kitten, pollita (chicken) or gatita (kitten).” She argues that these word choices aren’t arbitrary but rather “shed some light onto the expectations and beliefs society holds about males and females.”</p><p>Thinking beyond English raises another important question: <strong>Does language influence how we perceive the gender of animals?</strong></p><p>Some languages, like Spanish or French, have <em>grammatical</em> gender, where all nouns are gendered, even inanimate ones like <em>la mesa</em> (the table). In Spanish, many animals can be either masculine or feminine, such as the cat—<em>el gato</em> or <em>la gata</em>. But others, like the frog—<em>la rana</em>—are always grammatically feminine.</p><p>Are Spanish speakers more likely to perceive frogs as girls?</p><p>Maybe, at least according to <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10451744/">a recent study</a>. There are definitely Spanish children’s books with girl frogs in starring roles, like <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60182938-la-rana-mariana-busca-toda-la-semana-marsupiflap"><em>La Rana Mariana busca toda la semana</em></a> or <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37664900-rana-de-tres-ojos?ref=nav_sb_ss_1_17"><em>Rana de Tres Ojos</em></a>.</p><figure> <figcaption>The cover of <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60182938-la-rana-mariana-busca-toda-la-semana-marsupiflap"><em>La Rana Mariana busca toda la semana</em></a> (Mariana the frog searches all week), written by Mar Benegas and illustrated by Mariana Ruiz Johnson. The book stars Mariana (she/her).</figcaption></figure><p>Ladybugs are another intriguing case. Ladybugs are gendered as female in three of the four different books where they appear in our dataset.</p><figure> <figcaption>Ladybug from <em>Diary of a Fly</em> (2007), written by Doreen Cronin and illustrated by Harry Bliss.</figcaption></figure><p>In the English language, the word <a href="https://www.oed.com/dictionary/ladybird_n?tab=meaning_and_use#39884609">ladybird</a>—that’s what the Brits call ladybugs—and <a href="https://www.oed.com/dictionary/ladycow_n">ladycow</a>, another common term, originated around the 1600s. “Lady” was a reference to “Our Lady,” the Virgin Mary, apparently because both the beetle and the Holy Mother like to wear red. Ladybugs were also considered somewhat divine<sup><a href="https://pudding.cool/2025/07/kids-books/#footnote-3">3</a></sup> because they devour the pests that plague farmers and gardeners (yes, they’re carnivores).</p><p>Somehow the name spread, possibly through colonial networks and <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/46960/ladybird-ladybird">nursery rhymes</a>. In <em>The History of the Ladybird: With Some Diversions on This and That</em>, A.W. Exell documents 329 names for ladybugs in 55 languages. A full quarter of them are linked to the Virgin Mary.</p><p>Another widespread term is “God’s little cow”—also religious, feminine, and resembling the British “ladycow”—as found in Russian (<em>божья коровка</em>), Polish (<em>boża krówka</em>), and Hebrew (<em>פרת משה רבנו</em>). Many other names for the ladybug are similarly gendered, invoking young girls, little hens, and other diminutive feminine figures.</p><p>This reveals how the gendering of animals can be both arbitrary and deeply culturally ingrained. What began as, let’s face it, a bit of a stretch—a beetle’s symbolic connection to the Virgin Mary—steadily became the ladybug’s gendered destiny in many parts of the human world.</p></details>
<details> <p>So our gendered associations with certain animals—like the frog, bear, cat, or ladybug—are shaped by the biggest structural forces in our lives: the patriarchy, colonialism, language, history. But also? Many of these associations are kind of… random. And that’s inspiring in its own weird way. While it may be a bummer to realize how much our mental maps are shaped by British imperialism and 17th-century religious iconography, it also means those maps can be redrawn.</p><p>While broad patterns haven’t shifted over time, we did find plenty of meaningful exceptions.</p><figure> <figcaption>Olivia (she/her) from <em>Olivia</em> (2000), written by Ian Falconer.</figcaption></figure><p>Pigs, for example, may be flipping the script. While pigs were coded as male for a long time—hello, <em>Three Little Pigs and the Big Bad Wolf</em>—they took a strong feminine turn around the new millennium. In books like <em>If You Give a Pig a Pancake</em> (1998), <em>Olivia</em> (2000), and the <em>Elephant &amp; Piggie</em> series (2007-), pig characters are not only female but confident, curious, and central to their stories.</p><p>Plus, there are thousands of children’s books that are not in our dataset. We focus here on popular titles, but a lot of people intentionally seek out books beyond the mainstream.</p><p>Outside the spotlight, in indie and lesser-known titles, animal characters are hopefully getting weirder, wilder, and less predictable.</p></details>
<details> <p>You can find the data we used in this analysis <a href="https://github.com/the-pudding/kids-book-animals/tree/main/static/assets/data">on GitHub</a><a>.</a></p><h3>How and why did we select these books?</h3><p>We identified 30 popular children’s books with anthropomorphic animals for every decade since 1950, plus a catch-all category for everything before 1950.</p><p>To do so, we first compiled a general dataset of English-language picture books that have been popular in the 21st century. We collected information about books that were <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/shelf/show/picture-books">tagged as a “picture book”</a> the most times or included in a <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/107582">list of well-known picture books</a> on Goodreads. We added picture books that appeared on the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/books/best-sellers/picture-books/"><em>New York Times</em> bestseller list</a> for Children’s Picture Books and picture books that were tagged as “animals” in the <a href="https://dlp.lib.miamioh.edu/picturebook/">Children’s Book Database</a> at Miami University.</p><p>To find picture books that specifically feature anthropomorphic animals, we selected any book that had “animals” as one of its top Goodreads tags; any book that was tagged as “animals” in the Children’s Book Database; or any book that GPT-4o identified as featuring animals (after being prompted with its title, author, and description). We then manually evaluated every book and every representation of animal characters (for more on how we determined “anthropomorphic” animals, see below). We excluded anthologies and collections, like Grimm’s Fairy Tales.</p><p>We then ranked the remaining books by number of Goodreads ratings and selected the top ~30 books from every decade category.</p><h3>What counts as anthropomorphic and “important to the story”?</h3><p>We include animal characters that meet the following criteria: 1) the animal exists (or existed) in the real world; 2a) the animal is an active subject at some point in the book; 2b) the animal has dialogue or plays a role in the story; 3) the animal has at least one anthropomorphic quality (e.g., clothing, speech, upright walking, jobs, personality, uses tools, facial expressions, complex relationships, cultural behavior, lives in a house, etc.). We exclude animals that were only referred to as a group or in a plural form (e.g, “… said the birds”, “the squirrels jumped”).</p><h3>How did we identify gender?</h3><p>We identified the gender of animals based on how they were referenced in the text: with feminine (she/her), masculine (he/him), or neutral (it, they/them) pronouns; with a gendered honorific (e.g., Mr., Ms.) or familial role (e.g., brother, mother); or simply by their animal name (e.g., the frog) or a character name. Our analysis focuses on how animals are represented along a gender binary, but this reflects textual cues. Gender, whether in humans or animals, is much more complex than this binary suggests.</p><p>In our grid, we only display animals referenced with she/her, he/him, or it pronouns, or those referenced with a gendered honorific or familial role.</p><h3>What about animal characters that appear multiple times, like the Berenstain Bears or Pete the Cat?</h3><p>Our dataset includes some animal characters who appear multiple times in multiple very popular books, like the Berenstain Bears or Pete the Cat. In our analysis, we only consider one instance of an animal character and exclude repeat appearances. In our grid, we display every instance of an anthropomorphic animal, even in repeat appearances. This leads to some slight differences in gender percentage breakdowns between the dot plot and grid.</p><h3>How did we handle different names for the same animal (e.g., bunny, rabbit)? What animals did we exclude?</h3><p>Sometimes the same animal can have multiple names. For our analysis, we group together the following animal names: cat and kitten; dog and puppy; bunny, rabbit, and hare.</p><p>For our grid visualization, we group together some bugs (bug, maybug), some snakes (snake, python), sheep (sheep, lamb), fish (fish, trout, minnow, lantern fish), and birds (bird plus some specific bird types including stork, robin, sparrow, and parrot—other more distinctive birds like owls, eagles, geese, flamingoes, etc. have their own categories). We exclude animal terms that already imply the sex of the animal, like cow, hen, rooster, and gander.</p><h3>What prompt did we use for the survey?</h3><p>We provided survey respondents with the following prompt: “In the 1980s, there was a study that produced surprising results about our predictive tendencies. We’re conducting a similar study today. Instructions: Complete the line below. What did the bear do? Your response can be up to three sentences.</p><p>“And then the <strong>bear</strong> said, ‘I must go to the river.’ Upon arriving…””</p><p>We randomly swapped in one of seven animals: bear, bird, cat, pig, duck, mouse, or dog.</p><ul><li>1. We included ~30 books per decade since 1950, plus a catch-all category for books published before 1950. Because we were interested in the books that kids are reading today, we defined “popularity” not by historical sales or readership but by contemporary relevance—specifically, the books with the most Goodreads ratings as of the past year.<a href="https://pudding.cool/2025/07/kids-books/#ref-1">↩</a></li><li>2.
