  You can easily save documents to read later using Reader's browser extension
  or by uploading your files. To find popular content, just click a button to
  browse highlighted articles, PDFs, and tweets from other users. You can also
  access your saved documents from the Add Documents button in the app.

title: Quickly add great reads from the Readwise community to your library
---
<p>To get the most out of Reader, we encourage you to save the things you want to read as you come across them.</p>
<p>But to make finding great reads even easier, we share the most highlighted documents over the past week in a newsletter called <em>Wisereads</em>. <strong>Tap the button below to browse a catalog of these documents and quickly add them to your Reader library.</strong></p>

<p>For future reference, you can also access these documents from the Add Documents menu (<code>+</code> button when viewing your Library)!</p>
