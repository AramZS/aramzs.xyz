title: Trump Immigration Enforcer Says ICE Will Boost Raids in New York

<div gravitynodes="2" gravityscore="90.0"><p data-component="paragraph">Tom Homan , the border czar for President  Donald Trump , said that immigration agents will ramp up arrests in New York City as part of a broader crackdown on sanctuary jurisdictions that limit cooperation with federal authorities.</p><p data-component="paragraph">“We’re going to be in New York City,” Homan told reporters at the White House on Monday. “President Trump said it two weeks ago — we’re going to double down and triple down on sanctuary cities. Why? Not because it’s a blue city or a blue state, but because we know that’s where the problem is.”</p></div>
