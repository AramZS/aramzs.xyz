  Detainees at the Everglades facility, called "Alligator Alcatraz," say
  conditions are very bad. They report little food, no showers, cold tents, and
  constant lights. Officials have not shared details or responded to concerns.

<p>Florida still has not released the number of people being detained at what they call "Alligator Alcatraz" – but for the first time, we’re hearing from several men who are being held inside the facility.</p>
<p>Leamsy Izquierdo, also known as Leamsy La Figura, a self-described Cuban urban artist, was arrested for a violent incident and has been at the detention center out in the Everglades since Friday.</p>
<p>"There is no water here to bathe," he told Telemundo 51, adding it's been four days since he showered.</p>
<p>He believes there are about 400 people inside the facility.</p>

<p>"They give you food only once a day, food that even has worms in it," Izquierdo said.</p>
<p>Detention center lights are always on, 24/7, he said, and <a href="https://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local/harsh-conditions-at-alligator-alcatraz-heat-rain-mosquitoes-everywhere/3651896/">the mosquitoes</a> are "the size of elephants."</p>
<p>He said they are not allowed to go outside, and the tents are freezing.</p>
<p>Izquierdo’s partner, Katia, says he’s a permanent resident who was arrested last week. He was first taken to Turner Guliford Knight Correctional Center, then to Miramar, and finally to the Everglades facility.</p>
<p>"I don't think it's humane to have people in those conditions," Katia said.</p>
<p>Izquierdo was charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and battery. According to the police report, he had a violent dispute with a tow company worker, who was trying to repossess a jet ski.</p>
<p>Three other inmates had similar complaints. A Colombian national said he’s been there three days without his medicine.</p>
<p>NBC6 has reached out to ICE, but a spokesperson says they cannot talk about detainees who are not in one of their facilities. The Everglades detention center is run by the state, which has not responded to our requests for information.</p>
