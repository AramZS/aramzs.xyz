<p>One day after <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://ew.com/white-house-statement-the-view-pulled-off-air-joy-behar-criticism-11777461">hitting back at <em>The View</em> over Joy Behar's claim</a> that <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://ew.com/person/donald-trump/">Donald Trump</a> was jealous of Barack Obama's looks, the White House has again taken aim at a Hollywood institution in a statement to <em>Entertainment Weekly </em>criticizing <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://ew.com/south-park/"><em>South Park</em></a>'s satirical depiction of the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="4" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://ew.com/south-park-premiere-donald-trump-in-bed-with-satan-11778168">president seducing Satan in bed</a>.</p>
<p>The show's delayed season 27 premiere — which was pushed back and ultimately moved from Comedy Central to <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://ew.com/entity/paramount-plus/">Paramount+</a> amid parent company <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://ew.com/south-park-creators-slam-paramount-merger-comedy-central-11765213">Paramount's pending merger with Skydance</a> — included several scenes that showed a fictionalized version of Trump with a small penis. He later makes his way to a bedroom at the White House, where he undresses and gets into bed with Satan, who remarks on the size of the animated Trump's genitals.</p>
<p>"The left's hypocrisy truly has no end — for years they have come after <em>South Park</em> for what they labeled as 'offense' content, but suddenly they are praising the show," White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers tells EW via email, adding that "just like the creators of <em>South Park</em>, the left has no authentic or original content" to premiere.</p>

<p>"This show hasn't been relevant for over 20 years and is hanging on by a thread with uninspired ideas in a desperate attempt for attention," the statement continues. "President Trump has delivered on more promises in just six months than any other president in our country’s history — and no fourth-rate show can derail President Trump’s hot streak."</p>
<p>EW has reached out to representatives for Paramount for a response.</p>
<p>The season 27 premiere of <em>South Park </em>started with Trump engaged in a meeting with a satirical depiction of the prime minister of Canada. Then, after the meeting, Trump passes by an artist painting his portrait, with the president stopping to yell at them for giving him a small penis in the image.</p>
<figure></figure><p>"What the f--- is this?" the fictionalized version of Trump asks. "Why is my dick so small?"</p>
<p>The artist replies, "That's the size it is in the photo," which prompts his removal from the White House.</p>
<p>The cartoon iteration of Trump then enters his bedroom, where he undresses, revealing that his genitals are the same size as in the painting, and then attempts to seduce Satan in bed.</p>

<p><em>South Park</em>'s season 27 premiere came after a delay that led co-creators <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://ew.com/person/trey-parker/">Trey Parker</a> and <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://ew.com/person/matt-stone/">Matt Stone</a> to release a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://ew.com/south-park-creators-slam-paramount-merger-comedy-central-11765213">statement criticizing the Skydance merge</a> in which they alleged that "it's f---ing up <em>South Park</em>."</p>
