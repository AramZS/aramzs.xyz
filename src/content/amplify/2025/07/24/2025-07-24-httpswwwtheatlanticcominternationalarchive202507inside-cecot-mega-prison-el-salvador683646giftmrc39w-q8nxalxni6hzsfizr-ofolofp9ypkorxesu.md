<p>One night in mid-May, some of the Venezuelan migrants deported from the United States to a prison in El Salvador tried to break the locks on their cells with metal rails from their beds. It was a futile gesture of rebellion; no one thought they could escape. Still, punishment was swift. For six consecutive days, the inmates were subjected to lengthy beatings, three inmates told me. On the last day, male guards brought in their female colleagues, who struck the naked prisoners as the male guards recorded videos on their phones and laughed. The female guards would count to 20 as they administered the beatings, and if the prisoners complained or cried out, they would start again.</p>
<p>Tito Martínez, one of the inmates, recalled that a prison nurse was watching. “Hit the piñata,” she cheered.</p>
<p>When the government of El Salvador opened the prison complex known as CECOT in 2023, the country’s security minister said the inmates would only be able to get out “<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.seguridad.gob.sv/como-gabinete-de-seguridad-nos-encargaremos-de-que-ninguno-de-los-que-entre-al-cecot-salga-caminando-nunca-ministro-gustavo-villatoro/">inside a coffin</a>.” This promise has largely been kept. The Salvadoran human-rights organization Cristosal has documented cases of prisoners being transported out of the jail for urgent medical care, but these inmates died soon after, before anyone could ask them what it was like inside the prison.</p>
