<p>Hear ye, hear ye: A new <em>Avatar</em> has made their debut at Comic Con on July 24 — someone warn the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UByhxXvmX8o">Cabbage guy</a>! <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/avatar-seven-havens-new-series.html"><em>Avatar: Seven Havens</em></a>, a sequel series to <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/avatar-the-last-airbender-recap-locations-characters-plot-explained.html"><em>The</em> <em>Last Airbender</em></a> and <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/avatar-the-last-airbender-legend-of-korra-best-episodes.html"><em>Legend of Korra</em></a><em>, </em>premiered their new hero in a first look image: a young Avatar named Pavi, as well as her Snow Leopard-like cat friend Geet and her mentor Jae, an airbender, per <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/first-image-from-avatar-seven-havens-revealed-sdcc-2025"><em>IGN</em></a>. They all live in the sandy city of Allura. The series follows Pavi and her Earthbending, long-lost twin as they discover that Pavi is next in line to become the Avatar, in a world where an Avatar isn’t a savior but “humanity’s destroyer.” So, the four nations aren’t exactly going to be super welcoming to Pavi, even if her furry friend is incredibly adorable. You can’t win everyone over with cutie sidekicks, I guess. There will be 26 episodes over two seasons, and they will arrive sometime in 2027.</p>
<p>There’s no word yet on casting, nor when we’ll formally meet Pavi and her crew. However, we won’t have to wait until a hundred years pass to see another Avatar again; <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2022/07/first-avatar-studios-movie-aang-the-last-airbender-friends-nickelodeon-comic-con.html"><em>The Legend of Aang: The Last Avatar</em></a> is a feature film following the goofball airbender alongside Katara, Sokka, and Toph as young adults facing a new villain (played by <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2023/02/dave-bautista-can-play-anything-what-should-he-play-next.html">Dave Bautista</a>). It’ll be released next year on October 9, 2026, serving as an appetizer to Pavi’s adventure. Yip yip!</p>
