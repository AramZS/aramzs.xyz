title: United Airlines grounds entire US fleet after fire alarm at HQ
---
<p>United Airlines issued an urgent ground stop across its entire mainline fleet on Thursday night due to an active fire alarm at the integrated operations center.</p>
<p>There were fears the decision would spark delays and travel chaos across the United States.</p>
<p>Passengers who were already in the air at the time of the ground stop were warned to 'expect some airborne holding due to excessive demand.'</p>
<p>The ground stop has since been lifted, and a United spokesperson said: 'A fire alarm sounded at our operations center, which caused employees to move to our nearby backup facility and resulted in a brief nationwide ground stop of United aircraft.</p>
<p>'No flights were diverted, United Express regional flights [were] not affected.'</p>
<p>United operates the world's largest fleet with more than 1,000 planes, all of which were temporarily placed on hold.</p>
<p>The order came just days after <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/alaska/index.html">Alaska</a> Airlines <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13319815/Alaska-Airlines-flights-grounded-FAA.html">issued a similar ground stop which sparked hours of delays on Sunday night</a>.</p>
<p>In that case, the airline issued requested the US Federal Aviation Administration stop all mainline flights across the United States due to a system-wide IT outage.</p>

<p>United Airlines has issued an urgent ground stop across its entire mainline fleet due to an active fire alarm at the integrated operations center</p>
<p>Planes were grounded from around 8pm PT (11pm ET) before operations <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/galleries/article-13320505/Alaska-Airlines-grounded-FAA-technical-problem.html">resumed again at 11pm PT (2am ET</a>), Alaska Airlines said in a statement.</p>
<p>The firm has as many as 238 planes in its fleet - all of which are Boeing aircrafts - and its biggest hubs include Seattle, Portland, LA and San Francisco.</p>
<p>Shortly after the initial request, a secondary order came through to extend the ground stop to subsidiary airline Horizon Air, which operates another 45 planes.</p>
<p>Alaska Airlines admitted the ground stop would cause delays for travelers and have knock on effects into Monday.</p>
<p>'At approximately 8 p.m. Pacific on Sunday, Alaska Airlines experienced an IT outage that's impacting our operations,' the airline said in a statement Sunday evening.</p>
<p>'We requested a temporary, system-wide ground stop for Alaska and Horizon Air flights until the issue is resolved.'</p>
<p>The airline has warned of 'residual impacts to our operation throughout the evening' amid concerns about widespread travel delays.</p>
<p>'If you are traveling tonight, please check the status of your flight before leaving for the airport.</p>

<p>'We apologize to our guests for this inconvenience.'</p>
<p>One passenger revealed he and his fiancé spent two hours waiting on a tarmac in Denver before the flight crew finally instructed them that the plane would not be taking off.</p>
<p>At 10.30pm, all passengers were instructed to disembark and await further instruction, he said.</p>
<p>Another passenger, Riley Davis, said after two and a half hours on the tarmac, he still had no indication of when he would be free to deplane.</p>
<p>'Since they cannot coordinate exact gates, they are manually assigning gates via radio communication,' he revealed.</p>
<p>'I would love to know when I can get some dinner, I’m starving.'</p>
<p>He was inundated with comments from other travelers who said they'd noticed tarmacs around the country blocked by Alaska Airlines planes which had nowhere to go.</p>
