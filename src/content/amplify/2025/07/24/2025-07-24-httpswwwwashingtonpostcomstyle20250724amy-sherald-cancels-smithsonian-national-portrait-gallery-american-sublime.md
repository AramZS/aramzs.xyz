  Amy Sherald cancels Smithsonian show 'American Sublime' over ‘censorship’ -

<p>Painter Amy Sherald withdrew her exhibition “American Sublime” at the National Portrait Gallery. The Smithsonian denied trying to replace the painting in question.</p>
<p>Amy Sherald, the celebrated painter best known for her official portrait of Michelle Obama, has canceled an upcoming exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery, citing concerns that the museum might remove an artwork that could further provoke the Trump administration as it seeks to exert control over the Smithsonian Institution.</p>
<p>A Smithsonian spokesperson on Thursday confirmed that Sherald had withdrawn her exhibition, “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/art/2024/12/23/amy-sherald-american-sublime-retrospective/">American Sublime</a>,” from the museum.</p>
<p>“While we understand Amy’s decision to withdraw her show from the National Portrait Gallery, we are disappointed that Smithsonian audiences will not have an opportunity to experience <i>American Sublime,” </i>the statement read.</p>
<p>Representatives for Sherald declined to comment, though the painter appeared to confirm the news in an Instagram Story that linked to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/24/arts/design/amy-sherald-smithsonian-censorship.html">New York Times’s report</a> on the news.</p>
<p>According to the Times, Sherald said she had been told that the museum — <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/art/2025/06/13/kim-sajet-resigns/">whose director, Kim Sajet, resigned</a> after President Trump called for her ouster for being “a highly partisan person” — might remove a painting that depicts a transgender Statue of Liberty from the exhibition “American Sublime,” which was slated to open in September after touring at museums in San Francisco and New York. Sherald reportedly said Smithsonian head Lonnie G. Bunch III proposed replacing the painting with a video.</p>
<p>But the Smithsonian spokesperson said that Bunch wanted the video to accompany the painting — not replace it. The spokesperson added that the museum offered to spend more time contextualizing her piece, but Sherald chose to remove herself from the show.</p>
<p>“The Smithsonian strives to foster a greater and shared understanding,” the Smithsonian’s statement continued. “By presenting and contextualizing art, the Smithsonian aims to inspire, challenge and impact audiences in meaningful and thoughtful ways. Unfortunately, we could not come to an agreement with the artist. We remain appreciative and inspired by Ms. Sherald, her artwork and commitment to portraiture.”</p>
<p>Though Trump posted in late May that he was firing Sajet, he lacked the authority to do so, as director-level personnel decisions are made by Smithsonian Secretary Lonnie G. Bunch III. Sajet <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/art/2025/06/04/national-portrait-gallery-kim-sajet-trump/">continued to report to work for two weeks</a> until announcing her <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/art/2025/06/13/kim-sajet-resigns/">resignation</a>, explaining to staff that she was leaving because her presence had become a distraction from the Smithsonian’s mission.</p>
<p>Sajet’s ouster followed <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2025/03/27/trump-issues-executive-order-eliminate-anti-american-ideology-smithsonian/">an executive order</a> Trump issued March 27 titled “Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History,” which aims to “restore the Smithsonian Institution to its rightful place as a symbol of inspiration and American greatness.” A 35-year-old White House special assistant and senior associate staff secretary, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/power/2025/04/21/lindsey-halligan-smithsonian-executive-order/">Lindsey Halligan</a>, was among the order’s architects — instigated, in part, by her early-2025 visit to the show “The Shape of Power: Stories of Race and American Sculpture,” an exhibition at the Smithsonian American Art Museum, which shares a building with the Portrait Gallery.</p>
<p>The order calls for Halligan and Vice President JD Vance to “remove improper ideology” from the Smithsonian and “prohibit expenditure on exhibits or programs that degrade shared American values, divide Americans based on race.”</p>
<p>Sherald, who has been called “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/art/2024/12/23/amy-sherald-american-sublime-retrospective/">one of our greatest living portraitists</a>,” rose to prominence when she won the National Portrait Gallery’s Outwin Boochever prize for her portrait, “Miss Everything (Unsuppressed Deliverance).” The following year, she was selected to paint the official portrait of Michelle Obama along with Kehinde Wiley, who painted former president Obama. The paintings became a sensation, <a href="https://npg.si.edu/obamaportraitstour">touring the country</a>. A photograph of an awestruck two-year-old girl gazing at Sherald’s painting went viral, and later became a <a href="https://people.com/human-interest/parker-curry-michelle-obama-childrens-book/">children’s book</a>.</p>
<p>“American Sublime” was warmly reviewed by critics during its recent stints at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. “Sherald’s brilliance comes down to the subtlety and splendor with which she choreographs the push and pull of color relations,” <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/art/2024/12/23/amy-sherald-american-sublime-retrospective/">wrote Washington Post critic Sebastian Smee</a>.</p>
<p>The exhibition includes the portrait of Obama, as well as a portrait of Breonna Taylor, the 26-year-old woman killed by Louisville police after they forced entry into her home, inspiring countrywide protests about police brutality in 2020. Sherald would have been the first contemporary Black artist to receive a solo exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery.</p>
