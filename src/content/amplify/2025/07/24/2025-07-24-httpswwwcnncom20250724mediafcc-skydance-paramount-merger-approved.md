<p>The pending merger between Paramount Global and Skydance Media was <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-approves-skydances-acquisition-paramount-cbs">formally approved</a> by the Trump administration on Thursday, concluding months of regulatory uncertainty.</p>
<p>FCC commissioners voted 2-1 along party lines to give the $8 billion deal a green light. The approval means that Skydance can complete the deal and take control of Paramount in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>The usually lengthy merger review process was pockmarked by allegations of political interference stemming from President Trump’s scathing criticism of Paramount’s CBS News division.</p>
<p>In recent days Paramount’s owners-in-waiting, led by Skydance CEO David Ellison, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/23/media/skydance-fcc-cbs-news-bias-ombudsman-dei-paramount">agreed</a> to hire an ombudsman at CBS and pledged not to implement any new DEI policies.</p>
<p>Those commitments, as well as pledges relating to local content, were crucial for FCC chair Brendan Carr, who once showcased his loyalty to Trump by wearing a gold lapel pin of the president’s head.</p>
<p>Carr moved to have his fellow commissioners vote on the matter on Thursday.</p>
<p>“I welcome Skydance’s commitment to make significant changes at the once storied CBS broadcast network,” Carr said in a statement. “In particular, Skydance has made written commitments to ensure that the new company’s programming embodies a diversity of viewpoints from across the political and ideological spectrum. Skydance will also adopt measures that can root out the bias that has undermined trust in the national news media.”</p>
<p>“These commitments, if implemented, would enable CBS to operate in the public interest and focus on fair, unbiased, and fact-based coverage,” he added. “Doing so would begin the process of earning back Americans’ trust.”</p>
<p>Earlier this month Paramount <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/03/media/trump-cbs-news-staffers-paramount-settlement-60-minutes">agreed to pay $16 million</a> toward Trump’s future presidential library to resolve the president’s legally dubious lawsuit against CBS News.</p>
<p>The company and the FCC both insisted that the payout was unrelated to the merger review process, even as some Democratic senators likened it to a “bribe” in exchange for approval.</p>
<p>Paramount-owned programs have been in the news on a daily basis in recent days, highlighting the beleaguered company’s enduring power in the media marketplace.</p>
<p>Last week CBS announced that its flagship late-night talk show, “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,” will end next May. The network <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/18/media/colbert-cbs-late-show-cancel-paramount-trump">said the cancellation was purely due to “financial” strains</a>, not “other matters happening at Paramount,” meaning the pending merger.</p>
<p>Colbert <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/22/media/colbert-fallon-stewart-sandler-comedians-late-show-cancel">has been making jokes</a> about the network’s rationale on “The Late Show” ever since.</p>
<p>Jon Stewart, who hosts “The Daily Show” once a week on another Paramount-owned property, Comedy Central, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/22/media/jon-stewart-x-colbert">lambasted the company</a> on Monday and said he attributes the cancellation to Trump’s pressure campaign against the media.</p>
