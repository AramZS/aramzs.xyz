<p>In spring 2024, pro-Palestinian student encampments that began at Columbia and Harvard <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/pro-palestinian-protests-unfolded-college-campuses-us-timeline/story?id=109902300">spread to university campuses</a> throughout the U.S. as Israel invaded Gaza in response to Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, surprise attack. <a href="https://www.thefire.org/research-learn/2024-student-encampment-protests">At least 100 campuses had encampments</a> for at least a few days during this period.</p>
<p>While <a href="https://ash.harvard.edu/articles/crowd-counting-blog-an-empirical-overview-of-recent-pro-palestine-protests-at-u-s-schools/">some campuses erupted in violence</a>, others remained peaceful and didn’t experience the open conflict that led to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/harvard-penn-mit-president-congress-intifada-193a1c81e9ebcc15c5dd68b71b4c6b71">congressional hearings</a>, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/college-president-resign-shafik-magill-gay-59fe4e1ea31c92f6f180a33a02b336e3">university presidents losing their jobs</a> and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/04/08/nx-s1-5349472/students-protest-trump-free-speech-arrests-deportation-gaza">repercussions that are continuing to be felt</a> today.</p>
<p>What made the difference?</p>
<p>In spring 2024, Ohio State University’s <a href="https://www.coil-impact.org/">College Impact Laboratory</a>, where we all work, surveyed universities to learn more about whether their campuses experienced protests, what happened and how they handled them. Part of our goal was to understand how spiritual leaders played a role, if any, in managing the protests. We’ve been analyzing the data ever since. The results from those who responded point to several lessons universities could learn from to avoid violence in future protests.</p>
<h4>Campuses are a critical arena for activism</h4>
<p>Campus protests <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/higher-ed-gamma/student-protests-past-and-present-0">have long been a defining feature</a> of social and political change in the U.S. From the <a href="https://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/history-archaeology/student-movements-of-the-1960s/">civil rights movements of the 1950s and 1960s</a> to the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-48392551">student-led climate strikes</a> of recent years, higher education institutions have served as a critical space for activism.</p>
<p>Often, these protests reflect broader societal tensions, and <a href="https://scl.cornell.edu/sites/scl/files/documents/Navigating%20Campus%20Protests.pdf">how universities respond</a> has played a significant role in shaping their outcomes.</p>
<p>Historically, protests <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/0022002719887491">have been most likely to escalate</a> when students feel unheard. In contrast, institutions that <a href="https://scl.cornell.edu/sites/scl/files/documents/Navigating%20Campus%20Protests.pdf">adopt proactive strategies</a>, such as facilitating conversations or including students in decision-making, often experience better outcomes.</p>
<p>As our survey data shows, the pro-Palestinian protests illustrate this dynamic.</p>
<p>To gather data, the College Impact Laboratory sent questionnaires to administrators at the 329 universities that participate in our <a href="https://www.inspiresindex.org/">Interfaith Spiritual, Religious and Secular Campus Climate Index</a>, also known as the INSPIRES Index, as well as hundreds of colleges and universities in our recruitment database.</p>
<p>In all, 35 schools responded to our 23-question survey. Of those, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/pro-palestinian-protests-unfolded-college-campuses-us-timeline/story?id=109902300">we found that most protests</a> were led by students, half lasted less than a week, and the vast majority were nonviolent. Fifteen did not have protests, while the rest did. While the number of institutions that participated in this survey is relatively small, it does give us key insights into what schools were thinking.</p>
<p>Half of the campuses with protests reported law enforcement involvement – either campus police or city officers – with 20% experiencing physical altercations between protesters and police. Other disruptive actions such as academic interruptions, vandalism, physical violence and <a href="https://police.tufts.edu/safety/doxxing-and-social-media">doxxing</a> were reported with varying frequencies.</p>
<p>Protests at campuses that participated in our survey peaked during April and May 2024, with 70% of them experiencing demonstrations in these months.</p>
<p>Here are three takeaways from the survey, suggesting steps universities can take before and during future protests to avoid escalation:</p>
<h4>1. Involve students in guidelines for engagement – early</h4>
<p>At every surveyed institution that reported protests, students were at the forefront of organizing and leading these efforts.</p>
<p>Yet, despite this clear student leadership, about one-third of institutions said they didn’t consult with students to establish guidelines for engagement. Those that did invited representatives from student organizations or student government officers into the policymaking process to determine what protocols would be followed to manage protests and keep them peaceful.</p>
<p>On campuses where administrators didn’t engage with student leaders, tensions tended to escalate, and protests disrupted the institutions for weeks, often after police were called in or curfews were imposed.</p>
<p>While many of the protests lasted only one to seven days, we found that institutions that opened lines of communication early between administration and student protest leaders were more likely to deescalate tensions quickly. In contrast, campuses where administrators did not engage early on saw protests lasting weeks or involving greater disruptions.</p>
<p>Also, institutions that engaged early with student leaders were less likely to face stronger demands, such as calls for administrators to be fired, divestment from Israeli companies or calls to defund the campus police.</p>
<p>Our survey results suggest it’s important for administrators to engage with students early to establish clear guidelines to make it less likely future protests spiral into violence.</p>
<h4>2. Communicate openly, often and before protests</h4>
<p>Discussion of difficult topics, such as the conflict between Israel and Palestinians, shouldn’t wait until protests break out to begin. We found that every school in our survey that proactively supported dialogue between Jews and Muslims – before the war broke out – didn’t see violence result from the protests.</p>
<p>Dialogue isn’t just a strategy for preventing protests from spiraling out of control; it is <a href="https://www.wisconsin.edu/civil-dialogue/download/Transforming-Conflict-on-College-Campuses.Aspen-Institute-Article.pdf">fundamental to intergroup learning</a> in higher education. These events <a href="http://www.npr.org/2023/11/04/1210645223/how-two-dartmouth-professors-are-addressing-student-questions-on-the-israeli-pal">create safe spaces</a> for students − whether Arab, Jewish, Palestinian or members of different ethnic or religious groups − to engage with classmates with different points of view.</p>
<p>But even once protests begin, dialogue can help. When institutions engaged in dialogue, during or as a result of a protest, the protests were less likely to involve violence. At half of the campuses that participated in our survey and experienced protests, protests were ended peacefully through dialogue.</p>
<p>Brown, for example, modeled the power of institutional listening <a href="https://president.brown.edu/president/agreement-end-encampment">in its response to its April 2024 encampment</a>. Rather than escalating tensions, university leaders engaged directly with student activists, resulting in a peaceful resolution and a commitment to bring the students’ divestment proposal to a formal vote in October. It <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/09/us/brown-university-divestment-israel-hamas-war.html">ultimately failed to pass the board of directors</a>.</p>
<h4>3. Involve relevant groups in decision-making</h4>
<p>Most administrators in our survey, as they considered how to engage with protesters, reached out to relevant student groups such as those that focus on Jewish and Muslim students to better understand their perspectives.</p>
<p>However, only 28% consulted a religious or spiritual life office staff member on campus.</p>
<p>Religious or spiritual life staff are present on both private and public campuses and may include university-employed multifaith chaplains, interfaith coordinators or directors of spiritual life. Unlike student-led religious groups, <a href="https://www.interfaithamerica.org/article/chaplains-caring-student-spiritual-health/">these professionals</a> often serve as liaisons to the religious and nonreligious communities represented on campus.</p>
<p>The focus of such roles on serving students from all worldviews positions them as key resources for deescalation through community outreach, support and two-way communication. Additionally, these professionals have valuable expertise in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/21/opinion/sunday/thomas-l-friedman-three-cheers-for-pluralism-over-separatism.html">religious pluralism</a> and community relationships. This experience helps them to advise administrators on policy and potential courses of action in times of tension.</p>
<p>Consulting with university staff with a focus on religion or spiritual life makes particular sense given the nature of the protests and how religion is intertwined, but our data suggests they may be underutilized more broadly for their expertise in navigating tensions related to competing worldviews.</p>
<p>Proactive engagement with these leaders not only helps campuses navigate an immediate crisis but demonstrates a commitment to inclusivity and respect for different groups’ perspectives.</p>
<p>Put another way, our research suggests institutions can avoid the negative outcomes of protests by embodying the traits commonly associated with universities, such as showing mutual respect, fostering democratic debate and engaging in critical thinking even on divisive issues. Engaging from a mindset of goodwill with student leaders shows administrators value student voices and are willing to work collaboratively toward solutions.</p>
<p>But when campuses ignore peaceful protests or refuse to engage with student leaders, they risk turning manageable situations into prolonged crises.</p>
<p>At a time when divisions run deep, we believe campuses that lead by example by embracing dialogue and engaging student activists before, during and after protests take place are not only likely to see less violence, but are likely to help heal America’s great divides.</p>
