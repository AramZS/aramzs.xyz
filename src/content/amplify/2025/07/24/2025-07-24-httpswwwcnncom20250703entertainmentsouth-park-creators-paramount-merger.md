<p>  CNN — </p>
<p>“South Park” creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone don’t find anything funny about the planned acquisition of Paramount Global by Skydance Media.</p>
<p>“In response to the press release from Comedy Central about the change in premiere date for South Park, Trey Parker and Matt Stone said: This merger is a s**tshow and it’s f**king up South Park,” the two <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DLmzrHkO27z/">wrote in a post shared</a> on social media. “We are at the studio working on new episodes and we hope the fans get to see them somehow.”</p>
<p>“South Park” airs on Comedy Central, which is a part of Paramount. The company is in the process of being sold to Skydance Media.</p>

<p>New episodes of “South Park” were scheduled to air after a two-year wait on July 9. The Season 27 premiere has been pushed to July 23.</p>
<p>The delay comes amid uncertainty and negotiations over streaming rights to the popular animated property, according to <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/07/south-park-season-27-premiere-date-change-streaming-deal-1236447487/">Deadline.</a> “South Park” had an exclusive streaming contract with HBO Max that expired last week.</p>
<p>Paramount Global <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/02/media/cbs-trump-60-minutes-paramount-settlement">recently announced an agreement to pay $16 million</a> to resolve a lawsuit filed by President Donald Trump over a “60 Minutes” news report aired on CBS last fall.</p>
<p>The merger is reportedly expected to close on July 6, though it could possibly be extended.</p>
