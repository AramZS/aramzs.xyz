<p><em>This article was produced in collaboration </em><a href="https://www.courtwatch.news/?ref=404media.co"><em><u>with Court Watch</u></em></a><em>, an independent outlet that unearths overlooked court records. </em><a href="https://www.courtwatch.news/?ref=404media.co"><em><u>Subscribe to them here</u></em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p>A lawsuit <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26028439-govuscourtscand45304511/?ref=404media.co"><u>filed in California</u></a> against Roblox and Discord alleged that the former hosted Sean “Diddy” Combs and Jeffrey Epstein themed content children could easily access.</p>
<p>The games had names like “DIDDY SURVIVAL,” “diddy party,” and “Nice Try Diddy” and often bore the musician’s face. A search for the terms “Diddy” and “Epstein” in Roblox currently returns no results, suggesting the games have since been removed.</p>
<p>According to the lawsuit, an 11 year old girl was groomed and sexually assaulted after meeting a stranger on Roblox and talking to them on Discord. The lawsuit is seeking damages related to both company’s alleged negligence. The 105 page lawsuit said Roblox includes digitized Diddy parties and games where players must escape from Epstein’s Island. Roblox’s games “trivialize and gamify serious criminal conduct, including rape,” the lawsuit said.</p>
<p>The court documents cited a 2024 report from the <a href="https://hindenburgresearch.com/roblox/?ref=404media.co"><u>Hindenburg Research</u></a> group that looked into valuations of the Roblox Corporation and checked allegations that the company wasn’t providing a safe place for children. “To test out the platform, we set up multiple accounts of various ages to see what content was accessible to children. Using an account registered as a 9-year-old, we searched for games that reference Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs,” Hindenburg said in its report. These Roblox games <a href="https://tribune.com.pk/story/2501720/roblox-accused-of-hosting-predatory-content-like-escape-to-epstein-island-and-diddy-party?ref=404media.co"><u>received little media attention at the time</u></a>, and have been resurfaced by the lawsuit.</p>
<p>When Hindenburg put together its report, Combs had just been arrested and charged with several felony sex crimes. A jury found him <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/sean-diddy-combs-trial-verdict-jury/?ref=404media.co"><u>not guilty</u></a> of all but two of them. But back in 2024, the allegations against Diddy were a hot topic online and researchers said they found more than 600 games referencing Combs. A screenshot of the search result included in both the lawsuit and the research showed a row of Roblox games featuring Combs. Other titles included “Survive THE DIDDY in Area51,” “Freaky Diddy Simulator,” “[NEW] Midnight at Diddy’s Party,” and “Diddy Survival.”</p>
<p>The lawsuit alleged that Epstein-related games were on Roblox. “This report also revealed that Roblox permitted more than 900 Roblox accounts displaying variations of convicted sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein’s name, such as ‘JeffEpsteinSupporter,’ whose account Roblox actively permitted to be openly engaged in children’s games, ‘Escape to Epstein Island’—a title that directly references one,” it said.</p>
<p>A screenshot in both the lawsuit and the research showed a Roblox style avatar fleeing from an Epstein-faced demon amidst Hellish-flames. The game was titled “Escape to Epstein Island” and had zero players.</p>
<p>Roblox has a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-roblox-pedophile-problem/?ref=404media.co"><u>predator problem</u></a>. The game has more than 70 million daily active users, many of them children. According to media reports and this lawsuit, the company doesn’t do enough to police the space where children play. According to the lawsuit, a child predator assaulted the 11-year-old Jane Doe after a long grooming process facilitated by Roblox and Discord. “This predator’s actions were possible only because of Defendants’ egregiously tortious conduct,” the lawsuit said.</p>
<p>“Roblox also hosts a staggering number of experiences centered on simulated sexual activity. For instance, children can play in ‘condo games—predatory digital environments, including houses, where users can remove their avatars’ virtual clothing, revealing nudity, and engage in disturbing simulated sexual activities with other Roblox users,” the lawsuit said. “They can also play games like ‘Public Bathroom Simulator Vibe,’ which allows access to users as young as nine years old and enables users to simulate sexual activity in virtual bathrooms, as well as virtual strip clubs, where child avatars perform sexually explicit acts, like giving lap dances to patrons.”</p>
<p>Roblox did not immediately return 404 Media’s request for comment.</p>
