  Congratulations to the FAIR team on thier launch. 1.0 is the lonliest number,
  so getting to to this milestone is something for them to celebrate and I hope
  the team behind it feels great about getting this far. One of the best parts
  of getting to a public release is that you start getting feedback [‚Ä¶]

<p>Congratulations to the <a href="https://fair.pm/">FAIR</a> team on thier launch. <a href="https://ma.tt/2010/11/one-point-oh/">1.0 is the lonliest number</a>, so getting to to this milestone is something for them to celebrate and I hope the team behind it feels great about getting this far.</p>
<p>One of the best parts of getting to a public release is that you start getting feedback from real users. Some of that is coming out and I‚Äôm sure I will have some to add, at this point I don‚Äôt yet have a solid opinion on FAIR. What I do have are some questions I haven‚Äôt found the answer to while reading the <a href="https://github.com/fairpm/fair-protocol">protocol documentation</a>. I am hoping someone can either point me to the documentation for each of these or answer directly while I continue to digest as much as I can:</p>
<ol> <li>How does someone report a bad actor in a federated repository? If I discover someone who is acting in bad faith, do I need to track down every discovery aggregator, inform them independetly, and have each do its own investigation before users are protected? <ul> <li>For this purpose, I‚Äôm using Bad Actor in all of it‚Äôs possible meanings including introducing intentional and unintentional security issues, hacked accounts, and people being jerks. </li> </ul> </li> <li>What happens if different aggregagtors accept the same name for a plugin/theme? What can be done to prevent user confusion? <ul> <li>I think this is also important since someone doing local development with one aggregator but using a different in production feels like a distinct possibility.</li> </ul> </li> <li>In order to be listed in the plugin, is there a standard for the aggregator and the standards that they set for inclusion? <ul> <li>Similiarly, how will these standards be monitored for potential exclusion later on?</li> </ul> </li> <li>If the <strong>Decentralized ID</strong> is based on the repo, does that mean you can not transfer ownership of a plugin? <ul> <li>The <a href="https://github.com/fairpm/fair-protocol/blob/main/specification.md#resolving-dids">documentaiton states</a> ‚ÄúVendors SHOULD use DID methods that are future-proof for data portability, and which avoid encoding trademarks or potentially-ephemeral names or domains.‚Äù Does this mean that Github should be avoided since it is a trademark?</li> </ul> </li> <li>Does FAIR have a concept of release confirmations or other 2nd factor for releases?</li> <li>How do reviews work in a decentralized manner? If I have an opinion on a plugin, will I need to share it with all aggregators? <ul> <li>On a similiar basis, if reviews are going to multiple places, what is the plan to combat sock puppets?</li> </ul> </li> </ol>
<p>I imagine some of these are questions that will need to get answered over time, and also that for some, today‚Äôs answer may not be tomorrow‚Äôs. As with all open source projects, I can only imagine FAIR will change over time.</p>

<h3>One response to ‚ÄúSome initial questions about FAIR‚Äù</h3>
<ol><li> <p>These are all fair questions! üòâ I‚Äôll try and tackle them as best I can here, but please do come join us in the Discussions on the <a href="https://github.com/fairpm/fair-protocol/discussions">GitHub repos</a> and <a href="https://github.com/orgs/fairpm/discussions">org</a> üôÇ</p> <p>(Also: with all of these responses, treat them as draft responses ‚Äì we wanted to launch without having all the answers, so we can collaborate on them as a community.)</p> <p>Our plan is to take inspiration from Bluesky‚Äôs AT Protocol here, where individual repositories moderate what they host, with an additional ‚Äúoverlay‚Äù of moderation services on top that you could subscribe to (probably with a default too). You could, for example, then also subscribe to a security scanner moderation service that could do advanced checks and only let you install safe plugins ‚Äì going beyond what‚Äôs possible with today‚Äôs moderation.</p> <p>(e.g. Tide could have been a moderation service, or a security company like Wordfence or Patchstack could offer a paid moderation service)</p> <p>Aggregators are more like search engines than decision makers, so really this is more of a question of ‚Äúwhat happens if different vendors pick the same name?‚Äù</p> <p>This is one of those classic decentralisation things, and we‚Äôre looking at different ways we could tackle that. One way is again to copy what AT Proto does with domain name-based verification, so you could eg say ‚Äúthis plugin is verified as sitekit.google.com‚Äù.</p> <p>Thoughts very welcome on alternatives, and we‚Äôre also keeping an eye on what other decentralised protocols are doing too (eg Bluesky‚Äôs new verifications).</p> <p>Similar to the previous, think of aggregators more like search engines. We‚Äôll probably have an aggregator we provide, and let users switch between them.</p> <p>Because the choice is with the <em>user</em>, and it‚Äôs decentralised, there‚Äôs not necessarily a need to have a standard for everyone. We‚Äôll probably set one for an aggregator we provide (and have it be very similar to dotorg‚Äôs).</p> <p>With moderation also separated out, you could move some of the decisions about standards there; for example, you could have a moderation service that only allows packages which have an ethics statement.</p> <blockquote><p>If the Decentralized ID is based on the repo, does that mean you can not transfer ownership of a plugin? </p></blockquote> <p>DIDs aren‚Äôt based on the repo; rather, the DID tells us where to find the repo (along with which keys are valid). This means you have data portability.</p> <p>An example DID would be <code>did:plc:ia6vk5krwkcka2nwuzs6l6lq</code>. The plc part of this tells us it‚Äôs the PLC Directory, and you can look it up there: <a href="https://web.plc.directory/did/did:plc:ia6vk5krwkcka2nwuzs6l6lq">https://web.plc.directory/did/did:plc:ia6vk5krwkcka2nwuzs6l6lq</a></p> <p>You‚Äôll see that this lists which repository to use (<code>https://fairpm.example.com/</code> in this example), along with which signing keys are valid (verification methods) for checking packages.</p> <p>To move to another repository, you just need to change that URL. (You do this via a tool, probably an ‚Äúimport existing package‚Äù tool in your new repo.)</p> <p>The other type of DID we support is Web DIDs. These look like <code>did:web:aaron.jorb.in:some:path:name</code>, which would map to the URL <code>https://aaron.jorb.in/some/path/name/did.json</code></p> <p>These don‚Äôt use a directory like the PLC method, but the downside is they can never be changed. If you were to eg sell that plugin to someone else, or move your site to a different domain, you can‚Äôt change your Web DID. We recommend using PLC DIDs instead for that reason.</p> <p>The mention of trademarks in the docs is more for rebranding; for example, if you rebrand from ‚ÄúJorbin‚Äôs Excellent Plugin‚Äù to ‚ÄúExcellent Plugin by the Excellent Team‚Äù, you wouldn‚Äôt be able to change the Web DID to match.</p> </li></ol>
