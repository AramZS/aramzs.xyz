  Local laws prohibit most cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. A
  weekend shooting of a customs officer appears to have prompted the federal
  case.

<p>The federal government sued New York City over its sanctuary city statutes on Thursday, citing the recent shooting of a law enforcement official by an undocumented migrant as the latest example of its policies bringing “tragic consequences.”</p>
<p>The suit, filed in the Eastern District of New York with the United States of America as plaintiff, names Mayor Eric Adams, City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams, Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch, Department of Correction Commissioner Lynette Maginley-Liddie and others as defendants.</p>
<p>The complaint alleges the city’s policies, which forbid cooperation with civil immigration enforcement in most circumstances, purposefully impede federal immigration officers from doing their job.</p>
<p>“New York City has long been at the vanguard of interfering with enforcing this country’s immigration laws. Its history as a sanctuary city dates back to 1989, and its efforts to thwart federal immigration enforcement have only intensified since,” it says. “The challenged provisions of New York City law reflect the City’s intentional effort to obstruct the United States’ enforcement of federal immigration law, by (among much else) impeding the consultation and communication between federal and local law enforcement officials that is necessary for the United States to enforce the law and keep Americans safe.”</p>
<p>Kayla Mamelak Altus, the mayor’s spokesperson, said in a statement that “the job of a mayor is to protect the safety of every single person in their city.”</p>
<p>“That’s why the mayor supports the essence of the local laws put in place by the City Council — but he has also been clear they go too far when it comes to dealing with those violent criminals on our streets and has urged the Council to reexamine them to ensure we can effectively work with the federal government to make our city safer. So far, the Council has refused.”</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the NYPD did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>Rendy Desamours, a spokesperson for Speaker Adams, said: “[Attorney General] Pam Bondi may want to distract from reality, but the facts are clear: the evidence consistently shows that cities with sanctuary laws are safer than those without them. When residents feel comfortable reporting crime and cooperating with local law enforcement, we are all safer, something both Republican and Democratic mayors of New York City have recognized.”</p>
<p>The lawsuit takes aim at the city’s sanctuary laws, <a href="https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=1935437&amp;GUID=0A456911-54A6-41E5-8C5A-1D3B231D56AA">one of which bars</a> the NYPD and the Corrections Department from turning over people in their custody to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, unless ICE has a judicial warrant and the person has been convicted of a “violent or serious” crime within the past five years. The City Council passed the current version of the restrictions under former Mayor Bill de Blasio following advocacy from immigrant advocates who argued people were funneled into ICE’s deportation efforts, often for minor crimes or before a conviction occurred.</p>
<p>Lawyers for the U.S. Department of Justice assert in their filing that the sanctuary laws and their application by city agencies violate the constitution’s Supremacy Clause, which gives federal law priority where it conflicts with state or local laws.</p>
<p>The Trump administration had previously sued New York State over its “green light” law enabling drivers’ licenses for undocumented immigrants, which shields Department of Motor Vehicles records from the federal government. <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/02/06/nx-s1-5288871/justice-department-sues-chicago-and-illinois-over-sanctuary-laws">Chicago and Illinois</a> are also facing a Department of Justice suit over their sanctuary policies.</p>
<p>Mayor Adams has long criticized his own city’s sanctuary policies, and attempted to re-open an ICE office on Rikers Island. He was blocked from doing so <a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/2025/06/13/judge-blocks-mayor-from-allowing-ice-on-rikers/">last month</a>.</p>
<p>Trump’s fight against New York City was heightened this week in the aftermath of the shooting of an off-duty U.S. Border Patrol officer in an upper Manhattan park over the weekend — an incident cited in the lawsuit.</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem visited the city Tuesday and railed against the city’s sanctuary policies. NYPD officials said the alleged perpetrator was a migrant from the Dominican Republic accused of several grand larcenies and robberies conducted on a scooter in The Bronx.</p>
<p>“When I look at what Mayor Adams has done to New York City, it breaks my heart to see the families that have suffered because of his policies,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/21/nyregion/kristi-noem-eric-adams-customs-officer-shooting.html">she said</a> at a press briefing.</p>
<p>Tom Homan, director of ICE, vowed to “<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/07/21/ice-new-york-city-enforcement-00465313?nid=0000018f-3124-de07-a98f-3be4d1400000&amp;nname=politico-toplines&amp;nrid=e0241fdc-2e0e-4d02-bbbf-9a1bd20ebdea">flood the zone</a>” with ICE agents following the shooting.</p>
