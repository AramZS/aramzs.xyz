  Jeremy Corbyn was upset after Zarah Sultana announced a new left-wing party
  without his agreement. This caused divisions among left-wing activists and
  confusion about leadership. The new party could change British politics by
  attracting voters unhappy with Labour and other parties.

<p>At 8.11pm on Thursday, Zarah Sultana, the Corbynite MP for Coventry South, took to social media to unveil the news the left had long been waiting for.</p>
<p>Almost two years since October 7, and a day short of a year since the general election, she would lead <a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/9cd1f65e-0583-4202-b201-f1822c6b6948">a new political party</a> with Jeremy Corbyn — one unafraid to provide muscular opposition to the “genocide” in Gaza, Reform’s hardening rhetoric on migration and, above all, Sir Keir Starmer.</p>
<p>“Join us,” she said. “The time is now.”</p>

<p>In an instant, Sultana, a firebrand 31-year-old from Birmingham who, as a student, said she would “celebrate” the death of Tony Blair, committed herself and her older comrade, Corbyn, not only to the political death of <a href="https://www.thetimes.com/topic/keir-starmer">Starmer</a> but a new era in Westminster.</p>
<p>With its lofty language and calls for a reset of British politics, her message, viewed 7.8 million times on X and liked almost 240,000 times on Instagram, had echoes of the Gang of Four’s Limehouse Declaration, even if its online-only execution better suited the TikTok age.</p>
<p>Yet whereas the Social Democratic Party’s 1981 launch was born of the conviction that the liberals could no longer exist within a left-dominated party, Sultana was arguing that the left — more loud, more angry, but also more shapeless than ever before — could no longer exist within Starmer’s Labour. During the Iraq war, the left had never succeeded in creating a serious new force despite the depth of dissent about the government. Sultana was determined they would not make that mistake again.</p>
<p>There was just one problem. <a href="https://www.thetimes.com/topic/jeremy-corbyn">Corbyn</a> himself. Unbeknownst to anyone beyond a small circle of senior leftists, the usually peaceable Islington North MP and former Labour Party leader was furious about Sultana’s post. He agrees the moment demands a new party or movement to soak up dissent on the left and in minority communities — just not the one that was announced.</p>
<p>He implored Sultana to delete her message, to no avail. His wife Laura Alvarez, the Mexican socialist and former coffee bean importer, did the same. She, too, was ignored.</p>

<p>Karie Murphy, who served as Corbyn’s chief of staff when he was Labour leader, was horrified. So was Pamela Fitzpatrick, a trade unionist who is Corbyn’s co-director at the Peace and Justice Project — the foundation he created after losing the 2019 election and whose bank of email addresses and existing network is likely to be important in building whatever comes next. She messaged comrades in a fit of pique: “Neither Jeremy nor Laura deserves to be treated with such a lack of respect.”</p>
<figure><picture><figure><img alt="Jeremy Corbyn and Karie Murphy embracing outside Labour Party HQ." src="https://www.thetimes.com/imageserver/image/%2F3f5da14b-52a9-43f8-992e-63c91d6e57bb.jpg?crop=2546%2C1840%2C289%2C268&amp;resize=1022"/><figcaption>Murphy hugs Corbyn outside Labour’s headquarters in 2017</figcaption></figure></picture></figure>
<p>The reason for their displeasure was the same reason Corbyn then refused to say anything publicly for almost 24 hours. He eventually published a non-committal form of words endorsing the concept of an alternative but pointedly saying: “Discussions are ongoing.”</p>
<p>He had never agreed to “co-lead” anything with Sultana, be it a new party or the process by which one would in time be “founded”. The new venture thus succumbed to the great left tradition of splittism — pitting two co-leaders, one of whom did not recognise their position, against each other.</p>
<p>The reality is that Corbyn had been outmanoeuvred by comrades on the left who had engineered their preferred outcome less than 30 minutes before Sultana’s post. After discovering her announcement, he was outfoxed for the second time, as those around Sultana ignored his entreaties, predicting the ex-leader, non-confrontational to the end, would rather do nothing than acknowledge what had occurred and give ammunition to his perceived opponents within Labour and Fleet Street.</p>

<p>By Friday, they were vindicated to such an extent that Corbyn appeared in public with one of the key plotters. In so doing, he created the appearance of unity and did nothing to dispel the notion he had given the new venture his blessing.</p>
<p>The trigger for Sultana’s announcement was a Zoom meeting held earlier that day between leading socialists who have been quietly discussing a new force in politics for some months. The group has no name, no constitution and does not exist legally: known informally as the “organising committee” (after the name of a WhatsApp group) it brings together sympathetic elements of the left, who believe Labour is a spent force or were never part of it to begin with.</p>
<p>Corbyn was on the call. He was joined by staff and former aides involved in Collective, an entity quietly incorporated by Fitzpatrick at Companies House last year which is effectively Corbyn’s personal faction. Those involved believe he should be front and centre of whatever eventually emerges, at least on an interim basis.</p>
<p>Then there were members of the other tendency — those who believe a younger generation of socialist leadership must be an equal part of any new movement. Among them were Sultana herself, who is fiercely ambitious; <a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/80c8bcb2-9b4e-4c1d-8394-f9d2679f2ee1">Andrew Feinstein</a>, the South African anti-corruption activist who ran against Starmer in Holborn &amp; St Pancras at the last election, and Salma Yaqoob, the former leader of Respect, the party founded by George Galloway.</p>
<p>Some of them share a sense of frustration that Corbyn has not been decisive enough since his election victory as an independent in July last year. They sympathise with him over the traumatic experience of his leadership and subsequent suspension from the Labour Party for alleged antisemitism, but believe time is of the essence.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, the regularity and sense of purpose of meetings had intensified, both because of fears the Greens could seize the agenda, and a sense of impatience as Starmer’s government falls further in the polls.</p>
<p>Before last week’s call, Feinstein anonymously submitted a memo arguing for a party co-led by Sultana and Corbyn. Corbyn’s allies had submitted their own, arguing that only he had the authority to be leader and ought to do it alone. Corbyn himself agrees — not due to a desire to be front and centre again, some close to him say, but rather because he believes joint leaderships do not work.</p>

<p>In the event, Yaqoob, who chaired the meeting, called a vote on both papers. Corbyn’s allies were dismayed, arguing the group had no authority to vote on anything and that such an exercise undermined the dialogue and consensus supposed to be at the heart of any venture.</p>
<p>Yaqoob, wielding the digital gavel, pressed ahead anyway, stating most of those on the call wanted a vote on the two options. Corbyn and his allies boycotted the contest saying some kind of wider democratic event was needed to make such a decision. In turn, Feinstein and his allies were able to vote and claim victory. This prompted Sultana’s post a short time later: the new party was born.</p>

<p>Alan Gibbons, a children’s author inspired by Corbyn’s 2015 leadership to join Labour, summarised the matter neatly. “Yesterday, Andrew Feinstein put forward a paper for co-leadership with JC and Zarah Sultana as those co-leaders. Husayn [a Collective member] argued against our collective position then, without consulting other comrades, [and] said he would have a Zoom to explain.</p>
<p>“We wanted consensus on a leadership position … we thought moving to co-chairs was too big a decision to take before a democratic conference so we abstained on that.”</p>
<p>He continued: “The vote therefore was for co-chairs. We have nothing against Zarah Sultana, but we believe JC should have been the interim leader.”</p>
<p>Corbyn smouldered as the post exploded online, fruitlessly demanding it be taken down. Just as horrified was Murphy, his former chief aide, who responded by launching a purge on Collective’s WhatsApp group, of which several members of the rival tendency had, at least until then, been part, including Yaqoob and Feinstein.</p>
<p>One member of the group spoke for many when he responded: “Sorry guys but am I missing something here? What on earth is going on?”</p>
<p>Fitzpatrick said: “No courtesy was afforded to Jeremy in terms of sharing the paper [advocating a co-leadership model] with him. A room of people decided something tonight against Jeremy’s wishes. I have no idea who many of them are or their politics.”</p>
<p>She said she could “understand people being excited about the prospect of a new party” but stressed that Corbyn and his wife nevertheless deserved respect. “Perhaps some thought could be given to that,” she added.</p>
<p>Yet the genie was out of the bottle. Instead of publicly condemning the post, Corbyn went to ground. The next day, he posted a statement warmly congratulating Sultana — and even appeared alongside Feinstein at a socialist event in Ilford for Leanne Mohamad, the Palestinian-British activist who came within inches of unseating Wes Streeting, now the health secretary, at the last election.</p>
<figure><picture><figure><img alt='Image of a screen showing event information for "Breaking the Two Party Nightmare," featuring Leanne Mohamad, Andrew Feinstein, and Jeremy Corbyn.' src="https://www.thetimes.com/imageserver/image/%2Fa88cdc23-c086-43cb-a416-485c75354f60.jpg?crop=1364%2C915%2C0%2C251&amp;resize=1022"/><figcaption>Image of a screen showing event information for "Breaking the Two Party Nightmare," featuring Leanne Mohamad, Andrew Feinstein, and Jeremy Corbyn.</figcaption></figure></picture></figure>
<p>Some around Corbyn are less disposed towards bridge-building, at least for the time being. As Amy Jackson, his former political director, said in a WhatsApp message on Friday: “We WANT this to work and to work with whoever else we can to make it a success … but the carry-on last night has caused major and unnecessary division. It can’t be just glossed over as it has broken trust, which is essential to moving forward.”</p>
<p>What nobody can say is what will happen next.</p>
<p>On one hand, the events are farcical and even comical, especially to Labour MPs who, after a historically bad week, privately likened the split to <i>Monty Python’s Life of Brian</i>, in which the People’s Front of Judea wars against the Judean People’s Front.</p>
<p>Yet there may be serious implications. Polling indicates a party led by Corbyn and aimed at left-wing and Muslim voters could command 10 per cent of the vote nationally. Independents garnered more than half a million votes at the last election — more than double the previous tally. Should a venture aimed at such voters succeed in 2029, it could give the organised left a similar presence in Westminster to that which Reform has now — numerically insignificant, but a symbol and a guarantee of a national voice. It could also help Reform by further peeling progressives away from Labour on a local level, allowing Farage’s party to capture seats where Starmer is already vulnerable.</p>
<p>There is also the question of how a new party would interact with the Greens, already in the grip of their own Corbynite insurgency with <a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/c1ccadca-9f1b-4880-a337-135202e26ac2">leadership candidate Zack Polanski</a>, or independents. With the first-past-the-post system already struggling to contain a multi-party political order, the permutations and combinations are countless.</p>
<p>Which is why Corbyn’s support, or lack of it, and the venture’s success, or failure, matters.</p>
