<p>Four Turkish mayors who had opposed the country’s president were arrested this week, amid a widening crackdown that has ensnared more than 500 government critics.</p>
<p>Ankara has said the detentions were part of a wide-ranging effort to battle corruption, but the vast majority of those targeted belong to the opposition CHP: <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/turkey-mayor-arrested-tayyip-erdogan-crackdown-opposition-imamoglu-istanbul/">The</a> <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/another-opposition-mayor-arrested-in-turkey-as-part-of-erdogans-latest-crackdown/">mayors</a> detained by police were all members of the party, while a Reuters tally puts the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/turkey-detains-hundreds-erdogan-opponents-pursuit-octopus-corruption-2025-07-10/">overall total at 14 elected CHP mayors</a>, as well as upward of 200 party members or affiliated local officials.</p>
<p>The arrests come with elections on the horizon: A nationwide vote must be held before 2028 if President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan is to run again — unless he amends a constitutional term limit.</p>

<p>Singapore and London, two of the world’s most congested airspaces, are testing artificial intelligence air traffic control systems.</p>
<p>Air traffic controllers are notoriously overworked, having to monitor thousands of flights a day and frequently forced to rely on decades-old technology.</p>
<p>The aviation industry is exploring the use of AI — which does not get tired and can pay attention to several inputs at once — to monitor aircraft. However, using AI would <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/can-ai-replace-air-traffic-controllers-to-reduce-airline-accidents/">raise legal and ethical questions</a>, such as who is responsible for accidents, Scientific American reported.</p>

<p>Argentina’s senate approved a pension increase, putting it on a collision course with President Javier Milei and his austerity agenda.</p>
<p>Milei, who has slashed public spending by 30% since taking office in 2023, vowed to veto the legislation, which he called an attempt at an “<a href="https://elpais.com/argentina/2025-07-11/el-senado-argentino-vota-una-subida-del-gasto-fiscal-y-milei-denuncia-un-intento-de-golpe-institucional.html">institutional coup.</a>”</p>
<p>His cost-cutting has led to Argentina’s first budget surplus in years while helping tame runaway inflation, though austerity has also pushed poverty rates up, denting his popularity ahead of October legislative elections. “Fiscal conservatism isn’t always desirable,” economist Noah Smith wrote. “But Milei is showing that the costs <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/free-market-economics-is-working?utm_source=post-email-title&amp;publication_id=35345&amp;post_id=167907841&amp;utm_campaign=email-post-title&amp;isFreemail=false&amp;r=8848r&amp;triedRedirect=true&amp;utm_medium=email">often aren’t as high as many progressives warn.</a>”</p>

<p>Washington’s hawkish turn against Russia intensified as US President Donald Trump said he would send weapons to Ukraine via NATO and may back new sanctions on Moscow.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/07/10/politics/us-weapons-ukraine-nato-deal-trump">twin</a> <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/07/08/congress/senate-russia-sanctions-lindsey-graham-00443192">moves</a> represent a sharp contrast to the early months of the Trump administration, which were characterized by fitful attempts to coax Russia into a ceasefire as part of a broader rapprochement.</p>
<p>Alongside talks by Kyiv’s US and European allies in Rome to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-10/zelenskiy-says-meeting-raised-optimism-on-us-weapons-deliveries">bolster Ukraine’s post-war reconstruction</a>, the latest announcements suggest growing momentum to repel Russia’s recent battlefield progress.</p>
<p>Still, analysts cautioned against reading too much into the White House’s apparent shift: “<a href="https://ivodaalder.substack.com/p/has-trump-turned-on-putin?utm_source=post-email-title&amp;publication_id=1421981&amp;post_id=167944934&amp;utm_campaign=email-post-title&amp;isFreemail=true&amp;r=1nm2iq&amp;triedRedirect=true&amp;utm_medium=email">Trump’s record on Ukraine is reason for caution</a>,” a former top US diplomat argued. “I’m not holding my breath.”</p>

<p>US President Donald Trump threatened a fresh wave of across-the-board tariffs, with particularly onerous levies on Canada.</p>
<p>Doubling down on his trade war, Trump suggested <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-tariffs-inflation-hasbro-ukraine-patriot-missiles-nato-russia-rcna218125">a universal rate of up to 20%</a> in an NBC interview, and warned of <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cvg819n954mo">35% tariffs on Canadian imports</a>, with the levies coming into force on Aug. 1.</p>
<p>The Canada duties in particular point to Trump’s use of tariffs to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trump-doubles-down-on-using-tariffs-as-tool-of-american-power-c59ca442">extract political leverage</a> rather than to address trade imbalances, a strategy The Wall Street Journal described as “breaking with more than a half-century of global economic precedent.”</p>
<p>Trump argued that Ottawa had failed to tackle fentanyl, and has similarly threatened tariffs against Brazil for its prosecution of a former president Trump views as an ally.</p>

<p>Yemen’s Houthi militants sank a second cargo ship in the Red Sea in a week.</p>
<p>The fighters said they destroyed the Eternity C, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c3071vp2d8yo">killing at least three crew</a>, because it was heading to Israel; the attack came after the Iran-backed group blew up another vessel on Sunday.</p>
<p>All shipping between the Suez Canal and the Indian Ocean — about 15% of total maritime trade — must pass through the narrow Gulf of Aden between Yemen and Djibouti, close to Houthi territory. After a period of relative calm since a ceasefire in May, Houthi attacks have begun again in recent weeks.</p>
<p>When strikes last peaked in late 2024, <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2024/10/5/a-year-after-october-7-houthi-red-sea-attacks-still-torment-global-trade">cargo traffic through the canal plummeted by around two-thirds</a>, and insurance prices soared.</p>

<p>Fast-growing demand for matcha, combined with rising temperatures that have curtailed production, are driving the drink’s price up.</p>
<p>Matcha’s antioxidant properties and higher caffeine content relative to other green teas have helped it gain a huge customer base worldwide. But a second straight year of poor harvests in Japan’s Kyoto region — where much of the global supply of tencha, the leaves that are ground into matcha, is grown — has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/japans-heat-stressed-matcha-tea-output-struggles-meet-soaring-global-demand-2025-07-04/">pushed prices to record highs</a>.</p>
<p>Online forums dedicated to the drink have grown rancorous as a result: When one influencer posted a video of a suitcase stuffed with matcha powder, one commenter replied, “<a href="https://www.wsj.com/lifestyle/matcha-global-shortage-2389df26">This is the greed they talk about in the Bible</a>.”</p>

<p>French prosecutors have launched an investigation into X over allegations that the social media network, owned by billionaire Elon Musk, rigged its algorithms for the purpose of “foreign interference.”</p>
<p>The magistrate said Friday that the probe will examine whether the platform broke French law by manipulating algorithms and illegally harvesting user data. The investigation follows a January complaint <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/france-opens-criminal-probe-into-x-for-algorithm-manipulation/?utm_source=email&amp;utm_medium=alert&amp;utm_campaign=France%20launches%20criminal%20investigation%20into%20X%20over%20algorithm%20manipulation">accusing X</a> of spreading “massive amounts of hateful, racist, anti-LGBT+, and homophobic political content designed to distort France’s democratic debate.”</p>

<p>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said he had “<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/rubio-meet-chinas-wang-yi-malaysia-amid-trade-tension-2025-07-11/">very constructive</a>” talks with his Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, at a summit in Malaysia Friday, as the two superpowers compete for influence over Asia amid global trade tensions.</p>
<p>Rubio said that the odds of a meeting between Chinese leader Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump this year were high, adding there was a “strong desire on both sides.”</p>
<p>The meeting came as Trump threatened several Asian countries with high tariff rates effective Aug. 1, and as Beijing has sought to deepen economic ties with those nations. US-China tensions have also been high at the summit with Beijing warning Washington against reinstating hefty duties against it next month, and calling Trump’s latest tariff salvo, “<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-warns-trump-tariffs-threatens-retaliation-supply-chain-deals-2025-07-08/">typical unilateral bullying behavior</a>.”</p>

<figure></figure><figure><figcaption>Kevin Lamarque/Reuters</figcaption></figure>
<p>US President Donald Trump threatened a fresh wave of across-the-board tariffs, with particularly onerous levies on Canada.</p>
<p>Doubling down on his trade war, Trump suggested <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-tariffs-inflation-hasbro-ukraine-patriot-missiles-nato-russia-rcna218125">a universal rate of up to 20%</a> in an NBC interview, and warned of <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cvg819n954mo">35% tariffs on Canadian imports</a>, with the levies coming into force on Aug. 1.</p>
<p>The Canada duties in particular point to Trump’s use of tariffs to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trump-doubles-down-on-using-tariffs-as-tool-of-american-power-c59ca442">extract political leverage</a> rather than to address trade imbalances, a strategy The Wall Street Journal described as “breaking with more than a half-century of global economic precedent.”</p>
<p>Trump argued that Ottawa had failed to tackle fentanyl, and has similarly threatened tariffs against Brazil for its prosecution of a former president Trump views as an ally.</p>

<p>The “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/07/10/uk-france-migrant-deal-one-one-out/">one in, one out</a>” program will allow both countries to exchange migrants who can’t prove a family connection to the nation they entered, though the UN’s migration chief warned that such <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/ff15fe6b-4fb2-47a7-b726-8de1c69abf3e">harsh tactics are less effective</a> than supplying aid to countries that can host migrants.</p>

<p>Washington’s hawkish turn against Russia intensified as US President Donald Trump said he would send weapons to Ukraine via NATO and may back new sanctions on Moscow.</p>

<p>Alongside talks by Kyiv’s US and European allies in Rome to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-10/zelenskiy-says-meeting-raised-optimism-on-us-weapons-deliveries">bolster Ukraine’s post-war reconstruction</a>, the latest announcements suggest growing momentum to repel Russia’s recent battlefield progress.</p>
<p>Still, analysts cautioned against reading too much into the White House’s apparent shift: “<a href="https://ivodaalder.substack.com/p/has-trump-turned-on-putin?utm_source=post-email-title&amp;publication_id=1421981&amp;post_id=167944934&amp;utm_campaign=email-post-title&amp;isFreemail=true&amp;r=1nm2iq&amp;triedRedirect=true&amp;utm_medium=email">Trump’s record on Ukraine is reason for caution</a>,” a former top US diplomat argued. “I’m not holding my breath.”</p>

<p>Argentina’s senate approved a pension increase, putting it on a collision course with President Javier Milei and his austerity agenda.</p>
<p>Milei, who has slashed public spending by 30% since taking office in 2023, vowed to veto the legislation, which he called an attempt at an “<a href="https://elpais.com/argentina/2025-07-11/el-senado-argentino-vota-una-subida-del-gasto-fiscal-y-milei-denuncia-un-intento-de-golpe-institucional.html">institutional coup.</a>”</p>
<p>His cost-cutting has led to Argentina’s first budget surplus in years while helping tame runaway inflation, though austerity has also pushed poverty rates up, denting his popularity ahead of October legislative elections. “Fiscal conservatism isn’t always desirable,” economist Noah Smith wrote. “But Milei is showing that the costs <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/free-market-economics-is-working?utm_source=post-email-title&amp;publication_id=35345&amp;post_id=167907841&amp;utm_campaign=email-post-title&amp;isFreemail=false&amp;r=8848r&amp;triedRedirect=true&amp;utm_medium=email">often aren’t as high as many progressives warn.</a>”</p>

<p>Singapore and London, two of the world’s most congested airspaces, are testing artificial intelligence air traffic control systems.</p>
<p>Air traffic controllers are notoriously overworked, having to monitor thousands of flights a day and frequently forced to rely on decades-old technology.</p>
<p>The aviation industry is exploring the use of AI — which does not get tired and can pay attention to several inputs at once — to monitor aircraft. However, using AI would <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/can-ai-replace-air-traffic-controllers-to-reduce-airline-accidents/">raise legal and ethical questions</a>, such as who is responsible for accidents, Scientific American reported.</p>

<p>A federal judge in New Hampshire on Thursday once again barred the Trump administration from enforcing its executive order aimed at restricting birthright citizenship across the US.</p>
<p>The ruling stems from <a href="https://www.aclum.org/en/press-releases/federal-court-blocks-trump-birthright-citizenship-order-certifies-nationwide-class">a class-action lawsuit</a> filed last month, which sought to represent all potentially affected children. The class-action designation was key: The US Supreme Court recently limited the power of judges to impose such nationwide injunctions, except in cases seeking to block the president’s policies <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/10/us/politics/trump-birthright-citizenship-lawsuit.html">through class action lawsuits</a>.</p>
<p>The judge presiding over the case said the risk of children losing their US citizenship if Trump’s order took effect constituted <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/judge-weigh-blocking-trump-birthright-citizenship-despite-supreme-court-ruling-2025-07-10/">“irreparable harm”</a> and described citizenship as “the greatest privilege that exists in the world.”</p>
<p>The ruling will be paused for seven days to give the administration time to appeal.</p>

<p>The EU struck a deal with the Israeli government to allow a “​​substantial increase” in the amount of aid distributed in Gaza, the EU’s Vice President Kaja Kallas said Thursday.</p>
<p>The deal will see an <a href="https://x.com/kajakallas/status/1943260266306695195">increase in the number of food trucks</a> entering the enclave daily, as well as the opening of several access points in both the northern and southern regions of Gaza, Kallas said on X, and that humanitarian aid would once again be distributed through bakeries and public kitchens.</p>
<p>The announcement comes following a widespread humanitarian outcry over the Gaza Humanitarian Fund, a private US-backed foundation that began distributing aid in May. Its small number of distribution centers have become hotspots of chaos and violence, leading to the deaths of <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/5/going-hungry-more-than-700-palestinians-killed-seeking-aid-in-gaza">more than 700 Palestinians seeking aid</a>.</p>
<p>The deal comes with ceasefire efforts ongoing, with US President Donald Trump saying Wednesday that a truce between Israel and Hamas is likely to be agreed “<a href="https://news.sky.com/story/idf-chief-says-conditions-created-for-gaza-ceasefire-as-trump-says-it-could-be-this-week-or-next-13394738">this week or next.</a>”</p>

<p>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that new ideas for peace with Ukraine had been exchanged during a meeting with his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, but he tempered ceasefire hopes.</p>
<p>Rubio said that Moscow had proposed a “<a href="https://apnews.com/article/us-russia-ukraine-rubio-lavrov-tariffs-trump-asean-ca7569c363260b1a63bae12153fa7dd3">new and different approach</a>” while adding, “I don’t want to overpromise.” Moscow said the meeting was a “substantive and frank exchange.”</p>
<p>The talks came after US President Donald Trump has expressed increasing frustration with Russian President Vladimir Putin. On Tuesday, Trump accused Putin of “bullsh*t” by slow-walking peace talks, and recently threatened to support a bill that <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/rubio-meet-russias-lavrov-kuala-lumpur-us-official-says-2025-07-10/">would impose steep sanctions on Russia</a>, including 500% tariffs on nations that buy Russian exports.</p>

<p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen won a no-confidence vote Thursday by a significant margin.</p>
<p>Some 360 members of the European Parliament rejected the motion against Von der Leyen, while 175 backed the move.</p>
<p>A far-right group of the European Parliament had accused the EU president of engaging in corruption when negotiating access to COVID-19 vaccines, with <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/07/10/eu-ursula-von-der-leyen-confidence-vote/cde620b2-5d56-11f0-a293-d4cc0ca28e5a_story.html">Hungary’s prime minister joining calls for her to go</a>.

<p>Yemen’s Houthi militants sank a second cargo ship in the Red Sea in a week.</p>
<p>The fighters said they destroyed the Eternity C, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c3071vp2d8yo">killing at least three crew</a>, because it was heading to Israel; the attack came after the Iran-backed group blew up another vessel on Sunday.</p>
<p>All shipping between the Suez Canal and the Indian Ocean — about 15% of total maritime trade — must pass through the narrow Gulf of Aden between Yemen and Djibouti, close to Houthi territory. After a period of relative calm since a ceasefire in May, Houthi attacks have begun again in recent weeks.</p>

<p>US President Donald Trump said Brazil would be subject to a 50% tariff, after accusing the country of mistreating former President Jair Bolsonaro.</p>
<p>Trump has said that Bolsonaro — who is facing a trial over an alleged coup attempt — was the subject of <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/07/09/trump-tariffs-brazil-jair-bolsonaro/">a witch hunt</a>.</p>
<p>Brazil, a rare country with which the US has a trade surplus, has also drawn Washington’s ire after it hosted a summit of the BRICS bloc, with Trump threatening additional tariffs on the group.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/BrazilBrian/status/1943052901095559396">The standoff may extend</a> longer than other US-Latin America disputes, one expert noted: Brazil’s president may view the dispute as profitable politically, many Brazilians think the case could define the country’s democracy, and Brasília has little reason to capitulate quickly.</p>

<p>Chinese Premier Li Qiang arrived in Egypt for a two-day visit, seeking to deepen ties with a BRICS ally that has long been a US defense partner.</p>
<p>Li’s trip comes two months after Cairo and Beijing carried out their first <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/chinese-fighter-jets-soar-over-egypt-first-joint-exercises-2025-05-06/">joint military exercises</a>, notably with Chinese aircraft taking part.</p>
<p>China has in recent years <a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigations/china-builds-space-alliances-africa-trump-cuts-foreign-aid-2025-02-11/">forged industrial and defense ties</a> with several North African nations, and <a href="https://www.thenationalnews.com/news/mena/2025/07/09/chinese-premier-li-qiang-visits-egypt-to-deepen-ties-as-us-relations-sour/">Egypt has been cautiously receptive</a> to Beijing’s overtures, frustrated with US pullbacks but wary of growing too close to a country that many in the region view as excessively transactional.</p>

<p>Falling prices across a range of sectors — from pork to apartments — are weighing on China’s economic recovery.</p>
<p>Producer prices fell the most in nearly two years in June, while consumer goods costs fell month-over-month, despite eking out a narrow yearly gain.</p>
<p>Deflation has especially <a href="https://triviumchina.com/2025/07/09/deflationary-pressures-loom-large-in-june-price-data/">hit food prices</a>, with pork tumbling 8.5% since last June.</p>
<p>Prices for <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/09/cnbcs-the-china-connection-newsletter-the-hidden-drag-on-chinas-economy.html">secondhand apartments</a> have fallen, too, deepening Beijing’s property woes and underlining China’s challenges beyond the US trade war, CNBC wrote.</p>
<p>Experts have sounded the alarm over the economy in recent days, especially destructive price wars, which could <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-09/china-consumer-prices-rise-modestly-for-first-time-since-january">spur policymakers to ramp up stimulus efforts</a>, analysts said.</p>

<p>Nvidia on Wednesday became the first company in history to reach a $4 trillion valuation.</p>
<p>The market cap milestone for the US firm, which makes hardware to power the artificial intelligence boom, marks a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-09/nvidia-hits-4-trillion-value-as-rally-notches-another-milestone">rebound from earlier this year</a>, when the rise of Chinese AI startup DeepSeek caused Nvidia’s shares to dip.</p>
<p>The achievement also comes despite US chip export restrictions that have dented sales to China.

<p>US President Donald Trump on Wednesday threatened more countries with high tariffs, as analysts warn of the salvo’s geopolitical costs.</p>
<p>Trump’s letters dictating higher rates effective Aug. 1 hit Southeast Asia especially hard, creating a “<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/bc6b1f7a-36a4-4b7b-b9c4-ed111fd7ddd9">tariff wall</a>” around the export-dependent region, the Financial Times wrote.</p>
<p>That has <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/07/08/trumps-tariff-letters-roil-asian-allies-00443008">rankled Washington’s partners</a>, some of whom have <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/us-tariffs-take-centre-stage-asean-meets-malaysia-2025-07-08/">called for more intraregional trade</a>. “Many in Asia are going to ask, ‘<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/08/business/economy/trump-tariffs-talks.html">Is this how the U.S. treats its friends</a>?‘” one analyst said.</p>
<p>Trump sees the tariffs less as an economic tool, The New York Times’ Maggie Haberman wrote, and more as a mechanism to “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/09/us/politics/trump-tariffs-trade-policy.html">rebalance global influence</a>”: He threatened Brazil with 50% duties, accusing the country of a “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/09/world/americas/brazil-trump-bolsonaro-lula-coup-tariff.html">witch hunt</a>” against former President Jair Bolsonaro.</p>
