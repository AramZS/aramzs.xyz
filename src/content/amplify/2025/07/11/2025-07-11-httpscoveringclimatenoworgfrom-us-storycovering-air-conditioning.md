<h2>Story Spark: Air Conditioning</h2>
<p>As heat waves across the world become more frequent and intense, air conditioning (AC) is no longer a luxury, but a life-saving necessity. Studies have found that air conditioning significantly reduces heat-related illnesses and deaths, with widespread adoption in the US being <a data-wpel-link="external" href="https://kleinmanenergy.upenn.edu/research/publications/cooling-people-not-spaces-surmounting-the-risks-of-air-conditioning-over-reliance/">credited with a 75% decline in deaths</a> due to heat during the 20th century. It’s estimated that air conditioning <a data-wpel-link="external" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)01787-6/fulltext">averted nearly 200,000 premature deaths</a> globally in 2019, the third hottest year on record.</p>
<p>However, not everyone can afford effective cooling systems, including in the US where nearly <a data-wpel-link="external" href="https://www.kff.org/racial-equity-and-health-policy/issue-brief/disparities-in-access-to-air-conditioning-and-implications-for-heat-related-health-risks/">one in five low-income families have no AC</a>. Window units are less expensive than installing a central cooling system, but are less efficient, causing already high energy bills to skyrocket. And just “staying out of the heat” inside isn’t an option on the hottest days; analysis has found that nearly half of people who have died in the US from heat since 2004 <a data-wpel-link="external" href="https://thehill.com/changing-america/sustainability/environment/4739861-nearly-half-of-heat-related-deaths-happen-at-home-data/#:~:text=An%20analysis%20conducted%20by%20the,%2C%20while%2048%25%20were%20outside.">perished at home</a>.</p>
<p>The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that there are <a data-wpel-link="external" href="https://www.iea.org/energy-system/buildings/space-cooling">around 2 billion AC units in the world</a> and projects that this number could <a data-wpel-link="external" href="https://www.iea.org/reports/the-future-of-cooling">reach over 5.5 billion by 2050</a>. This increased demand is not only climate-driven but can also be attributed to rising incomes globally. In other words, if people in countries that experience extreme heat could afford to have AC today, they would already have it.</p>
<p>While AC poses a life-saving solution to rising temperatures driven by fossil fuel pollution, it unfortunately creates a “climate conundrum.” AC uses around 7% of the world’s energy and is responsible for <a data-wpel-link="external" href="https://ourworldindata.org/air-conditioning-causes-around-greenhouse-gas-emissions-will-change-future">nearly 3% of annual greenhouse gas emissions</a>. However, this fact shouldn’t be used to argue against AC adoption worldwide, as those who suffer the most from heat have contributed the least to carbon emissions. Rather, efforts need to be made to provide more efficient, affordable cooling systems to those who need them most, to create a cleaner, more resilient energy grid to support growing AC demands, and to explore other solutions to lessen the need for air conditioning.</p>
