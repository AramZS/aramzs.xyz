  The TSA is ending the rule that travelers must remove their shoes at airport
  security. This change uses new technology to keep everyone safe while speeding
  up the process. It may also affect the value of the TSA PreCheck program,
  which used to let people keep their shoes on.

title: 'T.S.A. to Let Travelers Keep Their Shoes On, Ending Hated Rule'

<div><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Travelers at some airports, including LaGuardia, may no longer need to undergo one of the most loathed requirements of security screening. For the first time in nearly 20 years, the Transportation Security Administration is letting people keep their shoes on.</p><p>In recent days, the T.S.A. began dropping its requirement for travelers to remove shoes, according to a source familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity.</p><p>The agency has not officially announced this change and did not confirm the new policy, which appears to be taking effect at airports across the country.</p><p>“T.S.A. and D.H.S. are always exploring new and innovative ways to enhance the passenger experience and our strong security posture,” a T.S.A. spokesman said. “Any potential updates to our security process will be issued through official channels.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The change was first reported by <a href="https://gateaccess.substack.com/p/exclusive-tsa-to-end-shoe-removal" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Gate Access</a>, a travel newsletter written by Caleb Harmon-Marshall, who says he is a former T.S.A. officer. He added that he had seen a soft launch of the new policy at an airport as well as an internal memo briefing officers about it.</p><p>The new policy is good for passengers and is long overdue, Mr. Harmon-Marshall said in an emailed statement. He added that officers would now be able to screen travelers more swiftly.</p><p>“They should feel relieved knowing that technology has advanced so significantly that T.S.A. officers can detect threats while wearing shoes,” he added. “In the old days, this wasn’t the case.”</p><p>The T.S.A. has been requiring passengers to <a href="https://www.tsa.gov/timeline" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">remove their shoes since 2006</a>, nearly five years after a terrorist tried to detonate an explosive in his shoe while aboard an American Airlines flight from Paris to Miami.</p><p>Travelers pay for the privilege for keeping their shoes on, one of the hallmarks of the T.S.A.’s <a href="https://www.tsa.gov/precheck" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">PreCheck program</a>, which costs roughly $80 for five years and grants expedited screening. Mr. Harmon-Marshall said in his statement that he believed a “huge shift” was underway with the PreCheck program.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The T.S.A. knows that allowing standard travelers access to perks like keeping on their shoes “will significantly diminish the value of PreCheck,” he added.</p><hr/><p><strong><em>Follow New York Times Travel </em></strong><em>on </em><a href="https://www.instagram.com/nytimestravel/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""><em>Instagram</em></a><em> and </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/traveldispatch" title=""><em>sign up for our Travel Dispatch newsletter</em></a><em> to get expert tips on traveling smarter and inspiration for your next vacation.
