  immigrant. The film shows Superman as a good person facing challenges in a

<p>Long established as an <a href="https://deadline.com/2018/06/world-refugee-day-superman-att-warner-bros-dc-comics-1202414371/">allegory for the immigrant experience</a>, especially when viewed through the personal histories of <a data-tag="superman" href="https://deadline.com/tag/superman/">Superman</a>‘s comic book co-creators — second-generation Jewish immigrants Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster — <a data-tag="dc-studios" href="https://deadline.com/tag/dc-studios/">DC Studios</a> co-CEO <a data-tag="james-gunn" href="https://deadline.com/tag/james-gunn/">James Gunn</a> said his forthcoming film entry of Kal-El keeps in tune with the original 1938-created vision.</p>
<p>“I mean, Superman is the story of America,” the <em>Superman </em>helmer told <a href="https://www.thetimes.com/culture/film/article/james-gunn-interview-superman-film-2025-david-corenswet-dhb3bw3rp"><em>The Times</em> U.K. in a new profile</a>. “An immigrant that came from other places and populated the country, but for me it is mostly a story that says basic human kindness is a value and is something we have lost.”</p>
<p>When asked how the blockbuster may be perceived in predominantly red versus blue states, especially amid prevailing anti-immigrant and refugee sentiment, Gunn responded, “Yes, it plays differently, but it’s about human kindness and obviously there will be jerks out there who are just not kind and will take it as offensive just because it is about kindness. But screw them.”</p>
<p>Releasing July 11 in theaters, <a data-tag="david-corenswet" href="https://deadline.com/tag/david-corenswet/">David Corenswet</a> stars as the iconic bespectacled superhero, depicted in the movie as an already established reporter at the Daily Planet dating Lois Lane (Rachel Brosnahan). When he gets drawn into conflict at home and abroad, the Man of Steel — and his trusty flying dog Krypto — must contend with swiftly shifting public opinion as tech billionaire Lex Luthor (Nicholas Hoult) spots an opportunity to ascend.</p>
<p>“Yes, it’s about politics,” Gunn said of his take. “But on another level it’s about morality. Do you never kill no matter what — which is what Superman believes — or do you have some balance, as Lois believes? It’s really about their relationship and the way different opinions on basic moral beliefs can tear two people apart.”</p>
<p>While Gunn said the Warner Bros. Pictures movie aims to balance its message and fun family appeal, the ultimate goal is to tell a human story.</p>
<p>“This <em>Superman </em>does seem to come at a particular time when people are feeling a loss of hope in other people’s goodness,” the <em>Guardians of the Galaxy </em>director shared. “I’m telling a story about a guy who is uniquely good, and that feels needed now because there is a meanness that has emerged due to cultural figures being mean online.”</p>
<p>He continued, “And I include myself in this. It is ad infinitum, millions of people having tantrums online. How are we supposed to get anywhere as a culture? We don’t know what’s real, and that is a really difficult place for the human brain to be. If I could press a button to make the internet disappear I’d consider it. And, no, I don’t make films to change the world, but if a few people could be just a bit nicer after this it would make me happy.”</p>
