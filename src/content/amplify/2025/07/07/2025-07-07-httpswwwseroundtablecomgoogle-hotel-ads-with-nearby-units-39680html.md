<p>Google seems to be testing a new ad unit for hotel or nearby listings that have big blue buttons to book at the site being listed. The button takes them to a direct booking form. I am honestly not sure if this is new but I am told it is.</p>
<p>This was spotted by Brad Brewer who posted the following screenshot on <a href="https://x.com/Brad_Brewer/status/1939568156256698386">X</a>:</p>
