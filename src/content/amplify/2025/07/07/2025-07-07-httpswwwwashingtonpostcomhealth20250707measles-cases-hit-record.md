<p>The United States has reached its highest annual measles case tally in 33 years, hitting at least 1,277 confirmed cases across 38 states and the District of Columbia.</p>
<p>The milestone marks a public health reversal in defeating a highly contagious, vaccine-preventable disease as the anti-vaccine movement gains strength.</p>
<p>The nation surpassed infections reported in<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2019/04/29/us-officials-say-measles-cases-hit-year-record/"> 2019,</a> reaching the largest number of cases since <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html">1992,</a>when officials recorded more than<a href="https://washpost.arcpublishing.com/ellipsis/#!/edit/GL3L5OPSSBENDLNKJIFCV42LDA/"> 2,100</a> infections, according to <a href="https://cori.centerforhealthsecurity.org/resources/measles-outbreak-response">data</a> published Friday from the Johns Hopkins University Center for Outbreak Response Innovation (CORI).</p>
