<p>Virtuos - the studio behind <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remastered-has-clocked-up-over-4-million-players-in-less-than-5-days">this year's successful The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered</a> and whose staff have also worked on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077s-23-update-wants-you-to-relax-and-take-in-the-night-city-sights-with-new-self-driving-cars">recently announced Cyberpunk 2077 update</a> as well as serving as a support studio for the anticipated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> - has reportedly been impacted by layoffs.</p>
<p>According to a post on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gautoz.cool/post/3lu3ntewdrk2t">BlueSky by Gauthier Andres</a>, a reporter for the French-language publication Origami, seven percent of the company's workforce will be subject to layoffs. That's 300 people.</p>
<p>These layoffs will allegedly be across the United States, Asia, Europe, and three branches in France. Andres' sources said the initial layoffs will affect those in China.</p>

<p>"Virtuos is said to have made significant efforts on Oblivion, with a policy of over-spending on quality and a royalty-free contract (without bonuses tied to the game's success)," Andres wrote (via machine translation). "The result: teams put under severe strain for a purely showcase game, whose profitability is doomed to be questioned."</p>
<p>The company reportedly put a freeze on raises and reduction on bonuses back in February of this year. This move led to questions regarding layoffs from staff to Virtuos' management. As a result, Andres said a strike is taking place at Virtuos Lyon, which will protest the layoffs and aim to "protect the future capacity of the branch".</p>
<p>According to sources, Virtuos is also making a move towards the use of generative AI. "In one year, we've gone from a few group-level presentations to basic but mandatory training for employees," Andres was told.</p>
<p>Eurogamer has asked Virtuos for comment on the report.</p>
<p>Layoffs have been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-is-going-on-with-the-video-games-industry">a depressingly regular</a> story in the video games industry over the past few years. Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/job-losses-studio-closures-cancelled-games-what-we-know-about-xboxs-devastating-wave-of-layoffs">Microsoft began another round of layoffs at the company impacting in excess of 9000 people</a>. This saw games cancelled and studios closed.</p><span data-fixed="false" data-hashid="" data-init="false" data-poll-position="1"></span>
