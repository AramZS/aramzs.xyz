Now the video currently in the lead is getting a further boost, with Google adding an Easter egg specifically referencing the clip.</p>
<p>If you currently use Google to search for the name of popular cast member <a data-ga-click="1" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-module="content_body" href="https://mashable.com/article/brennan-lee-mulligan-dimension-20-cloudward-ho-interview">Brennan Lee Mulligan</a>, the results page features a farewell message attached to an animated blue heart rising from the bottom of the screen.</p>
<p>"Good luck with your next venture," it reads. "We support you every step of the way."</p>
<p>A blue heart button will also appear at the bottom of the screen. Pressing it will cause shoe emojis to rain from on high, with more footwear appearing with every click.</p>

<p>This is a nod to a video created as part of <em>Game Changer</em>'s "Fool's Gold" episode, in which <a data-ga-click="1" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-module="content_body" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@gamechangershow/video/7527087942339267895">Mulligan ostensibly revealed that he was leaving Dropout</a>. In the clip posted to <em>Game Changer</em>'s social media channels, Mulligan sat down to directly address the camera, replicating the sombre tone often seen in serious video messages from online personalities.</p>
<p>However, it soon became apparent that this was a prank once Mulligan explained why he and Dropout were supposedly parting ways.</p>
<p>"As of today, I have dedicated myself to the craft and profession of making custom shoes for American Girl dolls," said Mulligan. "This is me!"</p>
<p>Of course, such an apparently serious and unexpected announcement concerning a fan-favourite cast member was inevitably going to get a ton of views. As of writing, Mulligan's announcement has a combined 3.5 million views across TikTok and YouTube. Of the other competing videos, <a data-ga-click="1" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-module="content_body" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@gamechangershow/video/7527080453610704183">Katie Marovich's brilliant season premiere of <em>Dimension 20: On a Bus</em></a> has accumulated 1.9 million views, while <a data-ga-click="1" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-module="content_body" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@gamechangershow/video/7527086642415422734">Izzy Roland's animated butthole pitch</a> has earned 1.1 million.</p>
<p>Dropout has acknowledged Google's Easter egg, posting a screen recording of it to their social media.</p>
<p>"A lovely send off to our former colleague on his new endeavour," <a data-ga-click="1" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-module="content_body" href="https://www.tiktok.com/embed/7527848447672732983">wrote the official Game Changer TikTok account.</a> The statement was accompanied by five shoe emojis.</p>
