  Murkowski won a concession in the Big, Beautiful Bill to protect tax credits
  for 12 months for wind and solar. But she said a recent presidential order and
  Interior directive undercut those plans.

<p>Sen. Lisa Murkowski said she feels “cheated” after she won a concession in the recently passed tax and spending law to protect wind and solar projects, only to see the president and his administration issue recent orders that she said seem designed to quickly quash such projects.</p>
<p>“I feel cheated,” she said in an interview Friday. “I feel like we made a deal and then hours later, a deal was made to somebody else.”</p>
<p>Murkowski said there were plenty of wins for Alaska in the megabill signed into law by President Donald Trump on July 4. Those include a new royalty sharing mechanism that in eight years is meant to start giving Alaska lots of revenue from oil production on federal lands.</p>
<p>While the megabill took steps to cut support for solar and wind projects, Murkowski managed to negotiate a measure to protect a 12-month window for the projects to receive tax credits, despite efforts by some Republicans to immediately eliminate them.</p>
<p>It was several years less than the tax-credit window allowed under the Inflation Reduction Act, approved by Democrats under former President Joe Biden in 2022.</p>
<p>Murkowski said she saw it as a way to protect wind projects that are needed to combat a looming energy crisis along the Railbelt in Alaska, along with other potential projects to combat sky-high energy prices in rural areas.</p>
<p>But days after the concession passed in the megabill, Trump issued an <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/07/ending-market-distorting-subsidies-for-unreliable-foreign%E2%80%91controlled-energy-sources/">executive order</a> that could lead to a rewrite of federal rules to limit the award of the tax credits for some solar and wind projects. The order also seeks to ensure that wind and solar projects don’t receive “preferential treatment” over other options that don’t provide intermittent power, such as oil, natural gas or hydropower.</p>
<p>Next, the Interior Department issued a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/07/18/definitely-playing-favorites-interior-memo-could-strike-dire-blow-to-wind-and-solar-projects-00460801">directive </a>requiring that Interior Secretary Doug Burgum personally sign off on even routine activities for wind and solar projects on federal land and waters. Some fear the move will slow or halt development even for projects on private land that need access from federal areas.</p>

<p>Murkowski said the executive order “just pulls the rug out from from underneath the deal” she’d made for the yearlong window for tax credits.</p>
<p>“I read it as just a total affront to what we had negotiated,” she said.</p>
<p>It’s plausible that the order was something Trump had promised to the conservative Republicans in the House to gain support for the Senate-passed bill, something <a href="https://www.opb.org/article/2025/07/17/trump-administration-order-requires-interior-secretary-sign-off-wind-solar-projects/#:~:text=Heat%20resources-,Trump%20administration%20order%20requires%20interior%20secretary%20to%20sign%20off%20on,into%20law%20on%20July%204.">pundits</a> have asserted, she said.</p>
<p>“To me, it’s just reckless by the administration,” and seems designed to move toward a repeal of the tax credits, she said.</p>
<p>“Do I feel like the administration was not being up-front with us? Yes,” she said.</p>
<p>“I said, ‘Well, I got a hard-won fight on this is clean energy provision,” she said. “It’s not everything that I wanted, but it’s going to keep some of our projects alive, and that’s important.”</p>
<p>But the executive order undercut the agreement, she said.</p>
<p>“So now you have an executive order that goes against what the president himself signed into law, in my view,” she said.</p>
<p>The White House press office did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday afternoon.</p>
<p>Murkowski, a strong advocate for oil and gas development in Alaska, said she favors a broad energy approach that includes solar and wind, as well as hydropower that will still be able to qualify for several years of tax credits in the bill.</p>
<p>Such a mix of energy sources was being looked at as a way to resolve a shortage of natural gas on the Railbelt grid that includes Anchorage and Fairbanks.</p>
<p>But the Trump administration is clearly bent on trying to halt the solar and wind industries, affecting two major energy solutions needed in the Railbelt, she said.</p>
<p>“If you were looking for something proof-positive that the administration is looking to literally cut off a sector of the energy industry, it couldn’t be more compelling than first the EO and now the (Interior directive),” she said.</p>
<h3>Gas crisis concerns</h3>
<p>Murkowski’s concerns come as utilities on the Railbelt grid eye solar and wind projects as a solution to counteract a shortage of the locally produced natural gas from Cook Inlet that they’ve long relied on.</p>
<p>The shortage has raised alarms about the possibility of <a href="https://www.adn.com/business-economy/energy/2025/01/22/rolling-blackouts-could-loom-for-urban-alaska-as-natural-gas-crunch-intensifies/">future power outages</a> in the region, and forced the utilities to make plans for potentially <a href="https://www.adn.com/business-economy/energy/2024/08/08/texas-based-company-says-its-in-advanced-discussions-with-alaska-utilities-on-plan-to-import-natural-gas-to-cook-inlet/">costly imports of liquefied natural gas, or LNG</a>.</p>
<p>The potential impact that the new executive and Interior orders will have on Alaska projects isn’t yet known.</p>
<p>The developer of two major wind projects that could cut natural gas demand on the Railbelt by 12% — Shovel Creek Wind outside Fairbanks and Little Mount Susitna Wind northwest of Anchorage across Cook Inlet — said after the bill’s passage that the projects are still on the table for potential development.</p>
<p>The shortened time window for tax credits raises questions about the future of the projects. And while the projects are on state land, the Little Mount Susitna project would require access from Cook Inlet’s federal waters.</p>
<p>Murkowski said the administration’s negative view of wind and solar power is clear and could threaten projects, forcing increased reliance on LNG imports that will lead to higher bills for residents and businesses.</p>
<p>“There is a window out there for them where they can qualify (for tax credits) under the current structure,” and they need to move fast, she said.</p>
<p>“But the signal that is being sent here is pretty clear,” she said.</p>
<p>“My fear is that you’re going to have your utilities looking at this latest signal out of the administration, and they’re going to say it’s just going to be too hard to do,” she said. “And so they retreat from this window of of opportunity to build out and say, ‘Well, I guess we’re just going to have to bank on LNG imports.’ ”</p>
<p>Murkowski said she thought officials in the Trump administration understood the value of local wind and solar projects in Alaska, where many villages must import costly diesel fuel by barge to provide electricity.</p>
<p>She said she’ll press Interior and Energy officials to help them understand the value of the wind projects in Southcentral, and others in Alaska that might benefit from the 12-month tax credit window, in order to keep the projects alive.</p>
<p>The effort will require a “coordinated” approach that involves project developers, utilities and community and state leaders, among others, she said.</p>
<p>“We have got to use all of our imagination, ingenuity and creativity to get them interested,” she said, so they understand “that these projects are not only beneficial, but necessary for us and our our grid reliability, affordability and and accessibility.”</p>
