<table> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <table> <tbody><tr> <td valign="top"> <p><strong>Thursday, July 17, 2025</strong><br/> <br/> Dear friends,<br/> <br/> We hope youâ€™re staying cool and finding some relief from this heat. As the saying goes, this may be the coolest summer of the rest of your life! ðŸ˜‰ All jokes aside, this week, weâ€™re spotlighting civic engagement.<br/> <br/> First, weâ€™ve got new updates on <a href="https://www.citycamp.nyc">CityCamp NYC</a>! Our community-powered unconference focuses on the future of public interest technology, design, and data. Itâ€™s happening on Saturday, September 6, at CUNY School of Law in Queens. Whether youâ€™re <a href="https://ti.to/betanyc/citycamp-nyc-2025">planning to attend</a> or want to help out <a href="https://www.citycamp.nyc/volunteer/">as a volunteer</a>, nowâ€™s a great time to get involved.<br/> <br/> Weâ€™re also sending kudos to OpenStreetMap editors whoâ€™ve helped make Brooklyn <a href="https://www.peopleforbikes.org/news/america-has-a-new-best-large-city-for-biking">the top large U.S. city for biking</a>, according to People for Bikes! It might not feel that way when navigating a blocked bike lane or riding in a shared lane, but itâ€™s all about the power of connected community assets. If youâ€™d like to contribute, our Mapping for Equity events will return on <a href="https://www.beta.nyc/event/e250806/">August 6 with NYC Council District 26</a>. Weâ€™re committed to ensuring that NYCâ€™s public space assets are open and accessible!<br/> <br/> On the topic of maps, we loved THE CITYâ€™s piece on UK artist Dan Ryder, who is creating a caricature-style map of NYC and inviting New Yorkers to help decide <a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/2025/07/10/dan-ryder-artist-map-drawing-london/">what should be included</a>. Itâ€™s a fun reminder of how storytelling and places go hand in hand.<br/> <br/> Meanwhile, weâ€™re proud to share that our colleague Naeema Haque just published a blog post <a href="https://www.beta.nyc/2025/07/17/cfa25-recap/">reflecting on her experience</a> at this yearâ€™s Code for America Summit. From sessions on digital equity to reflections on community-centered design, Naeemaâ€™s recap is full of heart and insight.<br/> <br/> And finally, we end with a story that lifts us all: Congratulations to Helaina, Henri, and Henniyah Rivers, the first Black triplets in the U.S. to <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/long-islanders-are-the-first-black-triplets-to-earn-eagle-scout-status-in-u-s/">earn the BSA Eagle Scout rank</a>. Their Eagle projects improved Brightwaters Town Hall, and now theyâ€™re training to represent Team Jamaica as Olympic alpine skiers. I wish them the best and pray that our society will allow them to develop their talents, build community, and help build a better tomorrow. <a href="https://www.newsday.com/long-island/suffolk/eagle-scout-west-babylon-first-black-triplets-scouting-america-oub00tf7">Their story</a> is a beautiful reminder of whatâ€™s possible when youth are empowered to lead and serve.<br/> <br/> P.S. Know someone working toward their <a href="https://www.girlscouts.org/en/members/for-girl-scouts/badges-journeys-awards/highest-awards/gold-award.html">Gold Award</a> or <a href="https://www.hoac-bsa.org/blue-elk/eagle-scout">Eagle Scout rank</a>? If theyâ€™re interested in conducting a community mapping project, please have them reach out to our team! We would love for them to leverage our Mapping for Equity materials to support their community service project.<br/> <br/> <br/> Excelsior,<br/> Noel Hidalgo, Executive Director</p> </td> </tr> </tbody></table> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table>
