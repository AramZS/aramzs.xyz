<p>That research came out of <a href="https://www.theajp.org/what-we-do/local-philanthropy-partnerships/">AJP’s Local Philanthropy Partnerships program</a>. (The Houston Endowment and Arnold Ventures are both <a href="https://www.theajp.org/about/our-support/">listed by AJP</a> as local philanthropy partners.) The city is home to several existing newsrooms, including the <a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com">Houston Chronicle</a>. The report, however, recommended starting a new, nonprofit Houston newsroom. The three local funders opted to move forward with that solution.<sup><a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2025/07/what-went-wrong-at-the-houston-landing/#footnote_1_241308">2</a></sup></p>
<p>The Houston Endowment and the Kinder Foundation each <a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/01/19/philanthropists-launch-new-houston-newsroom">committed</a> $7.5 million. Then there was $4 million from Arnold Ventures, $1.5 million from AJP, and $250,000 from the Knight Foundation. The nearly $21 million in seed funding was expected to support the organization from 2023 through 2025.</p>
<p>The vision for this exceptionally well-funded local news startup was ambitious from the outset. It would be one of the largest nonprofit newsrooms in the country, per AJP’s January 2022 <a href="https://www.theajp.org/news-insights/announcements/local-coalition-to-launch-nonprofit-newsroom-in-houston/">announcement</a>.</p>
<p>That announcement named a six-member search committee to choose the Landing’s CEO and editor-in-chief. The Houston-based funders chose the search committee members, AJP chief investment officer <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelouimette/">Michael Ouimette</a> told me, including three representatives from their own foundations: The Houston Endowment’s Stern; the Kinder Foundation’s Rich Kinder; and Arnold Ventures’ <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeff-cohen-8b952454/">Jeff Cohen</a>, a former Houston Chronicle editor who oversees the philanthropy’s media portfolio and serves on AJP’s <a href="https://www.theajp.org/about/board/">board of directors</a>.<sup><a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2025/07/what-went-wrong-at-the-houston-landing/#footnote_2_241308">3</a></sup></p>
<p>The search committee selected Scott McClelland, retired president of Texas supermarket chain HEB, as the Landing’s CEO. With McClelland, they made two more early hires: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mizanur-rahman-96a786251/">Mizanur Rahman</a>, who had been the Houston Chronicle’s investigations editor, as editor-in-chief, and <a href="https://houston.innovationmap.com/houston-innovators-podcast-emily-keeton-2661617306.html">Emily Keeton</a> as chief operating officer.</p>
<p>In September 2022, though, McClelland stepped down unexpectedly. A few months later, he was replaced by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/peter-bhatia-18603b8/">Peter Bhatia</a>, who had spent decades in editorial leadership roles at daily newspapers.</p>
<p>The Landing’s board of directors held its first meeting in November 2022. The board had four of the same members as the search committee: The three funder representatives (Stern, Kinder, and Cohen), and Anne Chao, manager of the Houston Asian American Archive at Rice.<sup><a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2025/07/what-went-wrong-at-the-houston-landing/#footnote_3_241308">4</a></sup></p>
<p>It was a mistake for the Houston Landing to put major funders on its board, someone with knowledge of the early hiring process told me.</p>
<p>“The worry is that you make decisions out of fear that [funders] are not going to renew their initial grants,” they said. That “really erodes your independence.” (This person understood that the grants had been made with the possibility of renewal. Multiple staff described Bhatia assuring them that funders would renew the grants at some level, as recently as this year; other reporting <a href="https://www.cjr.org/local_news/houston-landing-lost-major-funder.php">confirms</a> that at least some staff at the Landing expected some level of funding renewal.)</p>
<p>At least one funder, Arnold Ventures, had <a href="https://www.cjr.org/local_news/houston-landing-lost-major-funder.php">already decided not to renew its grant</a> months before the board voted to shut the Landing down.</p>
<p>The board composition also raises a governance issue, the person added. “The Landing had a situation where it had a board within a board,” they told me. “It was very clear that the power rested with [funder representatives Stern, Kinder, and Cohen]. The other three didn’t have nearly as much voice or power.”</p>
<h3>An editor-in-chief as CEO</h3>
<p>Peter Bhatia came to the Landing after a long and celebrated career in legacy newspapers — most recently, as the top editor at the Gannett-owned Detroit Free Press. He led newsrooms to 10 Pulitzer Prizes. Bhatia and Landing board member Jeff Cohen were industry contemporaries, serving as editors and executives of metro dailies in the same era. Bhatia had never led (or fundraised for) a digital-only nonprofit newsroom. He was not from Houston, though editor-in-chief Rahman had deep ties to the city.</p>
<p>The person with knowledge of early hiring recalled being excited about Bhatia’s journalism background. (They said another candidate considered for CEO was a retired executive from a Fortune 500 company.)</p>
<p>In hindsight, though, this person thought choosing a CEO who wasn’t familiar with Houston and didn’t have fundraising experience was a mistake. “We could do the greatest journalism possible, but if you’re not fundraising, that makes your sustainability very, very difficult,” they said.</p>
<p>Bhatia is a “man of integrity,” <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/turnerjoseph21/">Joseph Turner</a>, the Landing’s former director of marketing, told me. But he lacked “clarity, and vision, and leadership…in contrast to other CEOs that I had worked for.”</p>
<p>Former Landing staffers I spoke to said Bhatia never became deeply established in Houston and wasn’t an effective fundraiser.</p>
<p>“These nonprofit CEO jobs [are] more than 50% fundraising,” one nonprofit news expert told me. “Clearly, that either wasn’t happening or wasn’t successful.”</p>
<p>This was a “classic example of what one bad apple can do to an entire organization,” one reporter told me. (The same reporter compared the Houston Landing’s board to the shadowy Lumon Industries board in the TV show Severance.)</p>
<p>Bhatia declined requests for an interview and did not respond to detailed written questions. “Houston Landing faced several challenges, but I’m immensely proud of the impact it made during its short time,” he told me in a statement. “We were honored to deliver high-quality, nonpartisan journalism to the greater Houston community. Although there is conjecture about why Houston Landing closed, ultimately, it came down to financial performance. The Houston Landing team gave it our all to make it a success.”</p>
<p>A week later, he emailed me with another statement.</p>
<p>“I gave my all in working to make Houston Landing a success and for it to endure. I accept my responsibility for unsolved issues on my watch, but I was working against some circumstances from the beginning that made it extremely difficult,” Bhatia said. “I will not engage in personal disparagement of anyone associated with Houston Landing and I remain very proud of the work done by the staff in the last year. We made remarkable steps forward.”</p>
<p>“A local news solution must be staffed to produce enough to have impact,” the 2022 AJP slide deck noted. It imagined a newsroom staffed with enough journalists “to generate a critical mass of content that both serves every community in the way that it needs, and commands attention from local decision-makers and funders.”</p>
<p>The report budgeted for a 44-person organization (including 26 newsroom staffers) in the first year, growing to 61 people (including 37 newsroom staffers) by year four.</p>
<p>The Landing didn’t grow at quite that clip, but it staffed up relatively quickly. At launch in 2023, it had <a href="https://houstonlanding.org/houston-landing-announces-date-for-launch-of-full-website-on-local-news/">more than 30</a> “reporters, photojournalists, editors, digital specialists” and others. Six months later, the staff topped 40, and eight new hires were <a href="https://houstonlanding.org/houston-landing-hires-journalists-strategic-vision/">announced</a> in fall 2024.</p>
<p>Salaries were generous, by industry standards. According to the Landing’s <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/874133043/202520319349301242/full">2023 990</a>, Bhatia’s salary was $450,000; Rahman’s was $245,455; and other C-suite staff made well over $100,000.</p>
<p>The Landing’s revenue in 2023, per the 990, was $3.2 million. Expenses were $5.8 million, with executive compensation and other salaries making up more than two-thirds of that.</p>
<p>I asked Ouimette if, from AJP’s perspective, the Landing’s proposed pace of scaling up and spending was a strategic mistake. He said no: “The size and complexity of the Greater Houston area’s population and the strength of its philanthropic and business sectors validate both the need for and viability of strong nonprofit local news serving Houstonians.”</p>
<p>The AJP report also specified a target “original output frequency” for the newsroom: 140 stories per week, produced by a staff of 65. (The report noted that the more than 200-person Chronicle had an output of 555 stories per week.) At that rate, the Landing would have published 7,280 stories in a year.</p>
<p>The Landing, with its staff of 40-plus, published <a href="https://houstonlanding.org/impact-report/">936 stories</a> in 2024.</p>
<p>Cadence “was an ongoing conversation” at the Landing, the union member said. Many staffers came to the Landing believing it would prioritize time-intensive investigative reporting. The Landing “never found the right way” to address concerns about “needing more content, needing to keep the website fresh — things that are very normal and key parts of keeping a digital news site relevant.”</p>
<h3>All seed funding, little revenue</h3>
<p>The Landing spent, hired, and expanded like a newsroom that expected to get more money.</p>
<p>Instead, the seed funders and board members chose not to renew their own funding, and ultimately <a href="https://houstonlanding.org/houston-landing-to-cease-operations-in-face-of-financial-challenges/">pulled the plug</a>. And the organization consistently struggled to generate revenue.</p>
<p>Columbia Journalism Review <a href="https://www.cjr.org/news/houston-landing-closing-closure-lay-off-43-employees-texas-tribune-chronicle-morning-news.php">reported</a> that the Landing spent $7.9 million in 2024 — $2 million more than it brought in. It also reported that the Landing generated only $430,000 in new revenue last year, including $25,000 from major donors.</p>
<p>“Even when you have an up-front grant,” the nonprofit news expert I spoke with told me, “you’ve got to be really thankful for that grant the first day, and then on day two, pretend like you don’t have it and hustle as hard to diversify your revenue sources.”</p>
<p>One source of revenue was off the table from the beginning. The AJP report recommended a news outlet to fill local gaps should “make content available free” and described paywalls as making local reporting inaccessible. The funders made that commitment <a href="https://www.houstonendowment.org/perspective/houston-deserves-a-news-ecosystem-as-big-and-bold-as-it-is/">right away</a>, and Landing leadership stuck to it. “Our content will always be free,” Rahman wrote in <a href="https://houstonlanding.org/origin-story/">February 2023</a>. The Landing’s website affirmed, “As a nonprofit newsroom we want to serve as many people as possible. That’s why our content is free — with no paywalls and no subscription fees.”</p>
<p>“Many organizations in our portfolio are generating high membership revenues without a paywall,” AJP’s Ouimette told me. “Given the initial mission of the organization and ongoing audience trends, we don’t think a recommendation against a paywall was a mistake.” He also pointed to <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/06/24/few-americans-pay-for-news-when-they-encounter-paywalls/">recent Pew research</a> suggesting few Americans pay for news when they hit paywalls.</p>
<p>A budget from the AJP slide deck suggested that the Landing would bring in $1 million in revenue in its first year (including “membership, major donors, local foundations, national foundations, corporate partners”), and $2.5 million in its second year.</p>
<p>The 2024 <a href="https://houstonlanding.org/impact-report/">impact report</a> said the Landing had just over $80,000 in total membership revenue.</p>
<p>In some ways, the Landing’s seed funding became a liability, a staffer told me. The Landing had raised so much in seed funding that it was challenging to make the case to other funders that it needed more.</p>
<p>A product staffer also said the Landing’s struggle to build an audience (more on that below) hurt its ability to generate revenue. They recalled a fundraising staffer describing the site’s low pageviews as being “too nominal to be worth selling” to prospective donors.</p>
<p>Sponsorships, too, were difficult to attract with such a limited audience: “People that dole out huge sums of money for sponsorships don’t do it for 12,000 newsletter subscribers,” the product staffer told me.</p>
<h3>Firings and unionization</h3>
<p>Bhatia abruptly <a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2024/01/the-houston-landings-newsroom-is-blindsided-by-the-firing-of-its-top-editor-and-a-star-reporter/">fired</a> editor-in-chief Rahman and investigative reporter Alex Stuckey in January 2024 as part of an organizational “reset.”</p>
<figure><a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2024/01/the-houston-landings-newsroom-is-blindsided-by-the-firing-of-its-top-editor-and-a-star-reporter/?relatedstory"><img alt="" sizes="auto, (max-width: 315px) 100vw, 315px" src="https://www.niemanlab.org/images/houston-skyline-montrose-cc-315x177.jpg" srcset="https://www.niemanlab.org/images/houston-skyline-montrose-cc-315x177.jpg 315w, https://www.niemanlab.org/images/houston-skyline-montrose-cc-220x124.jpg 220w"/></a></figure>
<p>“We’re doing good work, we’re doing good journalism,” Bhatia told Stuckey in a meeting she recorded, “but we’re basically putting out a newspaper on the web. And that’s not a recipe for success for us for the long term, nor is it a recipe for sustainability. And in order to accomplish that, I just feel like there needs to be some fairly dramatic changes.”</p>
<p>Bhatia said the firings were solely his decision. “It is my belief that we need new ideas to execute our mission…effectively in the digital space,” he told me at the time. “Our coverage needs to be more original, distinctive and not available elsewhere.”</p>
<p>The Landing was “behind on embracing all the tools digital offers us, such as video, data visualization, [and] interactive story treatments,” Bhatia added. In an interview with Texas Monthly, he <a href="https://www.texasmonthly.com/news-politics/houston-landing-nonprofit-news-firings/">cited</a> The New York Times’ 2012 multimedia story “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/projects/2012/snow-fall/index.html#/?part=tunnel-creek">Snow Fall</a>” as the type of journalism he wanted the Landing to produce.</p>
<p>The newsroom, overwhelmingly loyal to Rahman, <a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2024/02/six-weeks-after-abrupt-houston-landing-firings-staffers-unionize/">unionized</a> six weeks after the firings. The union created its own <a href="https://x.com/htxlandingunion">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/htxlandingunion/">Instagram</a> pages and sometimes <a href="https://x.com/HTXLandingUnion/status/1762224638443077871">publicly</a> <a href="https://x.com/HTXLandingUnion/status/1764701311667241310">called</a> <a href="https://x.com/HTXLandingUnion/status/1795917527169589302">out</a> <a href="https://x.com/HTXLandingUnion/status/1798076569896067148">management</a>. The union’s social media accounts didn’t have many followers, but one union member recalled members of the fundraising team telling them in a staff meeting around mid-2024 that these posts were hurting fundraising. So “we cooled off on using social media and public-facing collective action,” they said. “And during that time, there was still no money brought in.”</p>
<figure><p class="rw-outer-content"><span>Some content could not be imported from the original document.</span> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C4HG1glpMGY/embed/captioned/?cr=1&amp;v=14&amp;wp=540&amp;rd=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.niemanlab.org&amp;rp=%2F2025%2F07%2Fwhat-went-wrong-at-the-houston-landing%2F#%7B%22ci%22%3A0%2C%22os%22%3A668.3000000119209%2C%22ls%22%3A379%2C%22le%22%3A662.6000000238419%7D">View content ↗ </a></p></figure>
<p>The person said it was not “a complete impossibility” that union actions made it harder to fundraise. But, they said, “if shining a light on the actions of our management — and the missteps or the miscalculations that they made; the way that workers were mistreated — is a bad thing, or is something that contributed to it being harder to raise money, maybe we should take a look at the actions that spurred those social media posts in the first place.”</p>
<p>Landing business staff involved in membership, development, fundraising, and finance did not respond to my interview requests.</p>
<p>From the start, the Landing was pulled in two different directions to meet different perceived “critical information needs” in Houston.</p>
<p>AJP’s proposal envisioned the Landing delivering the accountability journalism of a Texas Tribune or Marshall Project alongside the service journalism of an Outlier Media. That was the type of news the Houstonians surveyed said they wanted.</p>
<p>In 2024, Bhatia <a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2024/01/the-houston-landings-newsroom-is-blindsided-by-the-firing-of-its-top-editor-and-a-star-reporter/">told me</a> the Landing aimed to fill the gap between mainstream media and ethnic/alternative/community press with “a mix of strong accountability journalism and by bringing coverage and community engagement to the city’s underserved neighborhoods.”</p>
<p>The Landing <a href="https://houstonlanding.org/impact-report/">delivered examples</a> of both of these kinds of coverage. In a memo I reviewed, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/manny-garcia-news-editor/">Manny García</a>, the Landing’s editor-in-chief <a href="https://houstonlanding.org/manny-garcia-angel-rodriguez-announced-as-new-top-editors-at-houston-landing/">since April 2024</a>, referred to the Landing’s education coverage as “a differentiator in our news ecosystem.” A 2024 investigation into <a href="https://houstonlanding.org/hisd-illegally-suspended-1-in-10-homeless-students-last-school-year-new-data-shows/">suspensions of homeless students</a> led the school district to <a href="https://houstonlanding.org/houston-schools-crack-down-on-illegal-suspensions-following-landing-investigation/">crack down</a> and consider legislative action. The Landing’s housing reporting revealed that landlords <a href="https://houstonlanding.org/the-city-said-it-would-hold-damaged-senior-homes-accountable-after-derecho-then-beryl-hit/">did not repair hurricane damage</a> to public housing, which led to calls for <a href="https://houstonlanding.org/houston-to-seek-better-disaster-preparedness-plans-from-landlords-of-senior-group-homes/">increased regulation</a>. The Landing <a href="https://houstonlanding.org/colony-ridge/">reported extensively</a> on the largely Latino housting development Colony Ridge and ran accountability stories on <a href="https://houstonlanding.org/long-meetings-drawn-out-debates-harris-county-claims-to-be-more-transparent-but-is-it/">politics</a>, <a href="https://houstonlanding.org/harris-outgoing-district-attorney-recommends-unprecedented-plea-in-capital-murder-cases/">public safety</a>, and <a href="https://houstonlanding.org/we-dont-have-options-trump-ends-parole-for-venezuelans-cubans-nicaraguans-and-haitians/">immigration</a>.</p>
<p>The Landing’s service journalism, meanwhile, was exemplified by <a href="https://houstonlanding.org/explainers-guides/">explainers and guides</a> (some in Spanish) demystifying how the Houston Public Library could help people <a href="https://houstonlanding.org/trying-to-become-a-us-citizen-houston-public-library-can-help-you-navigate-the-process/">become U.S. citizens</a> or <a href="https://houstonlanding.org/need-food-relief-after-beryl-heres-how-to-apply-for-snap-and-other-assistance-in-texas/">apply for food assistance</a> after Hurricane Beryl. The Landing <a href="https://houstonlanding.org/goal-meet-the-latina-behind-the-2026-fifa-world-cup-houston-poster/">profiled</a> the woman behind a 2026 FIFA World Cup poster, highlighted Houstonians who <a href="https://houstonlanding.org/they-were-strangers-both-living-inside-the-loop-until-a-knitting-project-wove-them-together/">connected over a knitting project</a>, and ran photo essays celebrating everything from <a href="https://houstonlanding.org/photo-essay-iftar-a-sacred-day-of-ramadan-brings-community-together-in-houston/">Iftar</a> to <a href="https://houstonlanding.org/photo-essay-trail-riders-gallop-into-houston-rodeo-season-kicks-off/">rodeo season</a>.</p>
<figure><p class="rw-outer-content"><span>Some content could not be imported from the original document.</span> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DIjpcgPsukA/embed/captioned/?cr=1&amp;v=14&amp;wp=540&amp;rd=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.niemanlab.org&amp;rp=%2F2025%2F07%2Fwhat-went-wrong-at-the-houston-landing%2F#%7B%22ci%22%3A1%2C%22os%22%3A670.4000000357628%2C%22ls%22%3A379%2C%22le%22%3A662.6000000238419%7D">View content ↗ </a></p></figure>
<p>“Our team always punched above its weight with the goal to serve Houston,” García told me in a statement.</p>
<p>Still, the “both/and” approach — combined with a lack of clear leadership from Bhatia — gave the news outlet a split sense of its editorial identity, former staffers told me.</p>
<p>The dual priorities and catch-all phrase “underserved communities” also contributed to confusion over the Landing’s audience. Understandings of the organization’s actual and target audiences shifted over time, and tended to vary by team, by beat, and by editor.</p>
<figure><a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2024/09/why-does-the-wichita-beacon-keep-losing-reporters/?relatedstory"><img alt="" sizes="auto, (max-width: 315px) 100vw, 315px" src="https://www.niemanlab.org/images/wichita-adobe-stock-e1727720953342-315x177.jpeg" srcset="https://www.niemanlab.org/images/wichita-adobe-stock-e1727720953342-315x177.jpeg 315w, https://www.niemanlab.org/images/wichita-adobe-stock-e1727720953342-220x124.jpeg 220w"/></a></figure>
<p>Conflict over these two editorial directions <a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2024/09/why-does-the-wichita-beacon-keep-losing-reporters/">has come up</a> <a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2024/10/midwestern-news-nonprofit-the-beacon-shuts-down-its-wichita-newsroom/">at other news nonprofits</a>. But it’s not impossible to do both types of journalism well as a local news nonprofit. “Many of the organizations in our portfolio are successfully pursuing investigative reporting in addition to service reporting,” said AJP’s Ouimette, pointing to outlets like Mirror Indy, The City, and Outlier Media.</p>
<p>But the Landing’s execution for pursuing dual priorities “blew up in our faces,” the union member and former staffer told me. “The way that we tried to go about doing them both, ultimately, was a disservice to everyone in the long run, because we were spreading ourselves too thin, too fast.”</p>
<p>Joe Turner, a lifelong Houstonian, joined the Landing as director of marketing two years after the research that laid the organization’s foundation. He served in that role for most of 2024 before family and health conflicts contributed to him being let go (on what he described as amicable terms).</p>
<p>The Landing was the first news organization Turner had worked for; he’d previously done marketing for consumer brands and nonprofits. When he joined in February 2024, he believed the Landing had two urgent marketing goals: brand awareness and audience acquisition. Each goal would require engaging and retaining different audiences.</p>
<p>Turner believed he was hired to focus on the first goal, brand awareness. AJP’s founding report identified underserved communities (including low-income inner-city residents and non-English speakers) as an opportunity.</p>
<p>“You have to make them aware of who you are, and then you have to build credibility and trust with them,” Turner said. “If they don’t care about the news, why would they care about <em>our</em> news?”</p>
<p>At the same time, the Landing’s focus on accountability coverage and pursuit of tangible impact in Houston pushed it toward a different audience: power brokers and influential Houstonians, including civic leaders, politicians, and board members of other high-profile nonprofits. Reaching that audience meant competing in a saturated news market for people who already read other news.</p>
<p>There was another wrinkle. In practice, Turner said, the Landing’s data in the first half of 2024 suggested the people the Landing was actually reaching primarily fell into a <em>third</em> bucket: educated, upper-middle class urban Houstonians.</p>
<p>“The majority of the people that were reading our work were not people in underserved communities,” he said. “They were not minorities. They were educated, middle to upper-middle class, urban Houstonians.” This third group was precisely the audience that the AJP report had determined was already well-served by local news in Houston.</p>
<p>The former product staffer echoed Turner. The Landing’s audience consisted of “affluent, wealthier people,” they told me, “and that wasn’t the goal.”</p>
<p>From the Houston Landing’s earliest days, impact — not pageviews — was the metric for success.</p>
<p>“We decided early on that we had no interest in drumming up pageviews by publishing stories that offer little news value,” the Landing’s then-managing editor, John Tedesco, <a href="https://houstonlanding.org/these-journalists-refused-to-publish-clickbait-you-wont-believe-what-happened-next/">wrote</a> in June 2023, the month the site launched. “Instead, we talked about focusing on a more important metric — impact.”</p>
<p>The fall 2024 strategic plan stated the organization would “measure Houston Landing by the change we create, in policy, in law and in practice,” and named “impact” as one of its four strategic pillars (alongside “audience focus,” “crucial information,” and “financial sustainability”). Its 2024 <a href="https://houstonlanding.org/impact-report/">impact report</a> records “over 200 impact points.”</p>
<p>But “there was never really a consensus of what impact was,” the product staffer told me. Rahman had a clear view of what it meant that most reporters shared, they said; losing Rahman, for that contingent, amounted to another loss of direction for the newsroom.</p>

<p>The Landing was not alone among nonprofit news outlets in wanting to <a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2025/06/beyond-pageviews-small-news-nonprofits-develop-their-own-metrics-to-measure-impact/">use impact to define its success</a>. Impact is, however, notoriously difficult to define and measure — not to mention achieve. What’s more, deemphasizing pageviews risks disregarding a tool for identifying a gap between what your target audience have said they want, and <a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2024/10/is-the-crime-news-people-crave-the-crime-news-they-need/">what they may actually read</a>.</p>
<p>In April 2024, a year before the Landing closed, a <a href="https://www.poynter.org/business-work/2024/nonprofit-news-average-audience-size-better-metrics/">Poynter report by Rick Edmonds</a> described the Houston Landing as “not seeming as far along as [two experts involved in grantmaking and others] would have hoped in terms of audience numbers.” (At the time, Bhatia and AJP’s Ouimette disputed that statement and said the Landing was exceeding internal audience targets.)</p>
<p>Poynter pointed to Block Club Chicago and New York’s The City as examples of success “in building impressive audiences after years of focus.” But it suggested standout nonprofit news outlets delivering impactful reporting and building an audience, like The Baltimore Banner and Lookout Local, share two qualities: They’re paywalled, and broad in scope. “Tough-minded journalism is at the core of both, but it’s surrounded by softer community news content,” Edmonds wrote. “The result is something like a traditional newspaper mix but in digital format; an attractive bundle for a varied set of readers.”</p>
<p>The Houston Chronicle, which couples weather and sports coverage with a nationally recognized investigations unit that <a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/about/newsroom-news/article/houston-chronicle-doubles-impact-investigations-19814183.php">doubled in size last year</a>, falls into this category.</p>
<p>The Chronicle is mentioned 31 times in the AJP report. Introduced as “the ‘paper of record,’ but for whom?,” the Hearst-owned metro daily is characterized as generally covering news from a business perspective rather than a public service perspective. The slide deck describes the Chronicle as staffed by overextended reporters who leave Houston’s vast suburbs largely uncovered.</p>
