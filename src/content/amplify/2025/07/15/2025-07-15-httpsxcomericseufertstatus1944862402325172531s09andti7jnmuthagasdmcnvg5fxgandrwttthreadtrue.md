  Three common fictions and fallacies used to vilify / malign personalized
  advertising, in logical progression:


  1) Consumers are incapable of informed consent: they simply can’t comprehend
  the magnitude of data aggregated about them, or how it’s used. 


  Yet: a) ads targeting is fundamentally similar to the pervasive targeting used
  for other types of content, b) consumers routinely consent to complex and
  consequential contracts, and c) many consumers falsely believe that ads
  targeting is much more extreme than reality (eg., that apps surreptitiously
  surveil smartphone microphones for ad targeting keywords)


  2) Consent is genuine, but if personalized advertising is gated by consent,
  privacy becomes a luxury that only the highest-income consumers enjoy. 


  This ignores the realities of the auction mechanism and the nature of ads
  targeting: low-income users actually disproportionately benefit from
  personalized advertising, by definition, because a) they are less likely to be
  able to access products restricted by payment gates and b) high-income
  consumers are explicitly more likely to be targeted by ads and therefore face
  greater privacy exposure.


  3) The validity of consent is irrelevant, because personalized advertising is
  snake oil and simply doesn’t generate value above and beyond contextual
  targeting. 


  Not only does this ignore the vast volume of research on the economic value of
  personalized advertising, but it presumes that large ad platforms have
  colluded to invest increasingly larger sums of money into Rube Goldberg
  machines that accomplish nothing more than appearing complex. Surely one of
  these platforms would have opted out of this cosmetic exercise at some point.
  It also misinterprets the nature of the advertising auction and
  conversion-based bidding, which sees advertisers adjust bids to the value they
  realize.
