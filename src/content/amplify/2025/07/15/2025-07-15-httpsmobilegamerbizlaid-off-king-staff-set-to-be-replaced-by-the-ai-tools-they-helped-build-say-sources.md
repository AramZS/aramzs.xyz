<p>Multiple sources have given us an insight into what’s happening at Candy Crush maker King as it prepares to cut 200 staff.</p>
<p>Speaking to us anonymously they claim:</p>
<ul> <li>Many of the staff cut will effectively be replaced by the AI tools they built and trained</li> <li>The London-based Farm Heroes Saga team is being ‘cut in half’ with about 50 people leaving, including key leadership</li> <li>One staffer claims employees are being targeted by HR for loudly expressing dissatisfaction internally</li> <li>King told staff it will present a new org chart in September after union negotiations. Many staff are now in limbo for the summer</li> <li>A recent internal survey showed morale at an all-time low – it’s now “in the gutter”</li> </ul>
<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-02/microsoft-begins-deep-job-cuts-across-xbox-division?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1MTQ2MDUyOSwiZXhwIjoxNzUyMDY1MzI5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTWVJWTDFEV1JHRzAwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.HYeStbJNn6_ntf1rQ17kOC1dHHlVk_Zx4yCTGqcYXAA">Bloomberg broke the news</a> that King would be cutting around 200 staff earlier this month. That number was later <a href="https://mobilegamer.biz/around-200-jobs-to-be-cut-at-king-says-bloomberg/">confirmed by our sources</a>, who told us that the cuts were mostly in middle management and UX and narrative copywriting.</p>
<p>We’ve since been told more detail. Many level design and user research staff plus practically half of the London-based Farm Heroes Saga team are to be made redundant. The cuts will affect around 50 people on Farm Heroes Saga, we’re told, with some of the game’s leadership put on gardening leave ahead of their departure in September.</p>

<p>Many level designers, user research staff plus UX and narrative writers have also been told they’re at risk. In particular, these staff have spent the last few years building and training AI tools to do their jobs. They’re now effectively being replaced, say sources.</p>
<p>“Most of level design has been wiped, which is crazy since they’ve spent months building tools to craft levels quicker,” said one staffer. “Now those AI tools are basically replacing the teams. Similarly the copywriting team is completely removing people since we now have AI tools that those individuals have been creating.”</p>
<p>“The fact AI tools are replacing people is absolutely disgusting but it’s all about efficiency and profits even though the company is doing great overall,” they continued. “If we’re introducing more feedback loops then it’s crazy to remove the developers themselves, we need more hands and less leadership.”</p>
<p>The same source suggested that the total number of staff cut may be more than 200. Outside of the cuts at the London, Barcelona, Stockholm and Berlin studios, many centralised staff are also being removed, we’re told, including research and QA. “If a resource is centralised it is being cut or moved into the production teams,” said one source.</p>

<p>As discussions continue between King leadership and the unions and staff across those offices, many staff are effectively in limbo for the summer, unsure of whether their job will be cut or not.</p>
<p>Some programmers have been removed for “arbitrary reasons”, our source continued, suggesting that some of the people being removed have expressed “dissatisfaction with the company or processes” or are vocal in social groups within the company.</p>
<p>Another source told us about King’s long-running HR problems. In particular, the Candy Crush teams were described as being in a state of “constant but low attrition” and perpetual restructuring. “King HR is an absolute shitshow and has been for years,” said another source. “An extreme example of an HR department whose role it is to protect the company, not the staff.”</p>
<p>A recent internal employee survey conducted before the job cuts suggested that morale was already low at the company. One person familiar with the survey’s results and King’s response said: “The SLT [senior leadership team] said improving morale was a top priority…as you can imagine, it’s now in the gutter.”</p>

<p>On the day of the layoffs, one staffer who sat in the meetings said King’s management wanted to remove layers, stakeholders and processes slowing development down, particularly middle management.</p>
<p>“They also mentioned the fact that we are too specialized now and siloed between crafts, which has got us to our amazing profits but now is hampering us so we need to merge and generalize,” they said.</p>
<p>“It seemed that the main info communicated to us by leadership was literally being read like a script in the calls which is like a slap to the face.”</p>
<p>Another person added: “Despite the conditions forced upon the teams by inept leadership, the teams are very close-knit and do genuinely care about each other and are passionate about improving their games.”</p>
<p>Some senior staff have been put on gardening leave for the summer ahead of their expected departure in September. The company’s management team has told staff that a new org chart will be presented in September, we’re told.</p>
<p>We asked both Microsoft and King for comment before the publication of this story, but they have yet to offer a statement. We will update this article if they do.</p>
