<p>Research commissioned by Raptive—which handles ad sales for sites like Half Baked Harvest and Stereogum—found that people’s trust drops by nearly 50% when an article feels AI-generated, even if it isn’t.</p>
<p>That skepticism also hits brands directly. Research found a 14% decline in both purchase consideration and willingness to pay a premium for products advertised alongside content perceived as AI-made.</p>
<p>“This goes back to the story of advertisers working with trusted partners where you know their policies, and advertisers know partners are doing the right thing to make sure your ads appear in the right places,” said Paul Bannister, chief strategy officer, Raptive.</p>
<p>The study surveyed 3,000 U.S. adults to understand how people respond to content based on whether they believe it was created by a human or by AI. Participants were shown five articles from verticals including travel, food, finance, and parenting, with titles like “Traveling Across the U.K.,” each paired with a relevant branded ad. Half of the articles were AI-generated.</p>
<p>After reading the content, people were asked to rate both the content and the ads they saw across several attributes, such as emotional connection and trustworthiness.</p>
<p>The most surprising takeaway from the survey, according to Raptive’s svp, data strategy &amp; insights, Anna Blender, was “when people thought something was AI-generated, they rated that content much worse across metrics like trust and authenticity, regardless of whether it was really AI generated or not. That also impacted the ads they saw next to the content, deemed as less trustworthy.”</p>
<p>In one test, 300 people were told the content was AI-made, and another 300 saw the same article but were told it was written by a human. Those who believed the piece was AI-generated were 14% less likely to consider purchasing the product featured in the adjacent ad.</p>

<p>As AI tools have become ubiquitous, so has the rise of AI-spun content across the internet. The deluge of low-quality, questionable AI-generated images, articles, and videos—like the viral video of a cat “saving” <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@icatzone/video/7512094358481554731">a baby</a> from drowning—has given rise to the term AI slop. According to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/11/style/ai-search-slop.html">The New York Times</a>, the phrase has popped up in places like 4chan, Hacker News, and YouTube comments, where anonymous users often flaunt niche knowledge through in-group language.</p>
<p>That skepticism has evolved into what some now describe as AI stink—a growing sentiment of distrust when content <em>feels</em> AI-generated, even if it’s not.</p>
<p>Still, more media executives are betting on AI as a cornerstone of their strategy. In May, <a href="https://www.adweek.com/media/business-insider-layoffs-traffic-sensitivity/">Business Insider</a> laid off 21% of its staff while doubling down on AI, with CEO Barbara Peng saying there’s “a huge opportunity for companies who harness AI first.” <a href="https://www.wgbh.org/news/local/2025-03-11/local-gannett-owned-websites-are-using-ai-to-help-write-articles">Local outlets</a>, including MetroWest Daily News, Milford Daily News, and Wicked Local, are deploying AI to generate articles for their websites. Meanwhile, NewsGuard has identified <a href="https://www.newsguardtech.com/special-reports/ai-tracking-center/">over 1,200 AI-generated</a> news and information sites operating with little to no human oversight—many of them unaffiliated with traditional publishers.</p>
<p>As more publishers turn to AI for faster output, even well-crafted AI content can carry unintended consequences, reinforcing the growing sentiment of AI stink, said Bannister. He also noted that this study underscores the importance of keeping humans involved in AI content creation, while publishers have clear AI policies and explicitly label if AI has been used for content creation.</p>
<h4><strong>AI guilt by association </strong></h4>
<p>The trust damage doesn’t stop at content alone, spilling over to the ads placed alongside AI content, according to Raptive’s study. People who saw ads placed adjacent to content they perceived as AI-generated rated them 17% less premium, 19% less inspiring, 16% more artificial, 14% less relatable, and 11% less trustworthy.</p>
<p>Even without a visible AI label, the tone and lack of human touch were enough to erode brand perception, the study found, chipping away at engagement, conversion rates, and long-term equity.</p>
<p>“If you’re buying an ad, say, at $5 CPM, and this ad is performing 15% worse than the other one, there’s your loss,” Bannister said. “That’s real money, and your media investment is far less efficient.”</p>
