<p><a data-tag="deathpixie" href="https://variety.com/t/deathpixie/">Deathpixie</a>, who’s being billed as the first virtual artist in the electronic music space, has signed with <a data-tag="deadmau5" href="https://variety.com/t/deadmau5/">Deadmau5</a>‘s Mau5trap label, <em>Variety</em> can exclusively announce.</p>
<p>Since debuting last year with “Hell Girl,” Deathpixie has released a parade of singles that have racked up millions of streams across platforms. Described as an artist “born in the shadows of New Tokyo,” she was created by a group of songwriters, producers and animators. This past spring, she released covers of White Stripes’ “7 Nation Army,” the Prodigy’s “Smack My Bitch Up” and Deadmau5’s “Raise Your Weapons,” the latter of which caught Deadmau5’s attention and prompted him to sign her to his imprint.</p>

<p>“We’ve had a lot of neat artists release through mau5trap. Different styles of music and many first releases but nothing like Deathpixie,” says Deadmau5 in a statement to <em>Variety</em>. “How she runs in so many different lanes in her version of ‘Raise Your Weapon’ bringing it back with genres and shit we didn’t have back when I put this out like 15 years ago, plus her look, the whole concept. ‘New Tokyo’ is a badass place to be with her. She’s bringing projects like Gorillaz and Hatsune Miku to dance music, I’m all for it.”</p>
<p>To coincide with her signing, Deathpixie has released a cover of Deadmau5’s “Raise Your Weapon,” originally included on his 2010 album “4×4=12” and written by Deadmau5, Skrillex and CC Sheffield. She is currently gearing up for the release of her untitled new EP, dropping October 31. Following the EP’s release, she is prepping for immersive live performances.</p>
