<p>A love letter to music listings</p>
<p>About a year and a half ago, I was scheduled to play a concert in Vermont when word came that the gig would be canceled due to an approaching nor’easter. I checked out of the hotel early, lobbed my suitcase into the rental car, and hightailed it to New York as menacing clouds darkened the rearview mirror. Brooklyn had been home for the better part of two decades, but after a move to the Pacific Northwest, I was returning as a tourist, and the show’s cancellation augured a rare free evening in the city. There was just one problem: How was I going to figure out what to do with my night on the town?</p>
<p>This used to be easy. You grabbed <em>The New Yorker</em>, <em>The New York Times</em>, <em>Time Out New York</em>, or <em>The Village Voice </em>and checked out the event listings. When I graduated from college and moved to the city in 2003, <em>Time Out </em>quickly became my bible, syllabus, and road map. The listings guided me through the cobwebbed bowels of St. Mark’s Church and into the Ontological-Hysteric Theater hidden within, where Richard Foreman’s mind-bending plays made an indelible impression on me. The listings brought me to Southpaw to hear Neko Case’s bloodshot voice; to the Village Vanguard for Jason Moran or Paul Motian; and to a tin-ceilinged basement bar in Park Slope, where I saw a baby-faced Sharon Van Etten sing her earliest songs, and then bashfully hand out CDs burned with her demos, rich with high-frequency hiss from the tape deck onto which she’d recorded them.</p>
<p>But over the past decade, event listings have all but disappeared. <em>The New York Times </em>killed its weekly arts listings at the end of 2016, and its <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/arts-listings">online arts-and-entertainment guide</a> remains frozen, like a butterfly pinned and dried, in March 2020: “New York Arts Institutions Closed Because of Coronavirus” reads the top headline. <em>The Village Voice</em> folded in 2018. (It has recently been revived but has no listings section to speak of.) <em>The New Yorker</em>’s Goings On About Town section was slashed in 2023 to just a page or two, now offering one recommendation per discipline. And <em>Time Out</em>, that veritable doorstop of weekly listings, now previews one or two concerts <em>a month</em>.</p>
