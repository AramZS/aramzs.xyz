  Before he was called a patriot and a traitor for following Elon Musk to
  Washington to join DOGE; before he was hired by the US government despite a
  résumé that would have been previously rejected; before he was granted
  extensive access to sensitive data and invited to brief the country’s vice
  president; before he met his Twitter heroes in Silicon Valley; before he
  became a Thiel Fellow, which required him to become a college dropout; before
  he was celebrated internationally for using AI to help detect passages in a
  scroll charred by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius; before all of that, Luke
  Farritor, now 23, was a homeschooled kid in Lincoln, Nebraska, who called
  himself lukethecoder64.

He was a bell ringer at church. He played piano and golf, chess and Kerbal Space Program. During his high school summers, he helped build an app that could link those in need to local charities. It’s still in use.</p></div><div gravitynodes="1" gravityscore="61"><p>Back then, his father introduced him to an artist, Charley Friedman, who wanted to create a musical installation that people could move through, hearing different notes at different times, an experience individual and communal. “I’ve always been interested in how humans are easily manipulated by power, by bright lights,” Friedman says. He needed someone who could code and build and commit to a project that was then a concept. Farritor was around 15 when he began working with Friedman and 19 when they first exhibited Soundtracks for the Present Future, composed of 59 hanging, computer-controlled guitars and mandolins, at a contemporary arts center in Omaha. Farritor called it magical. It was featured on <a href="https://www.pbs.org/video/string-machine-2qthjm/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" title="The String Machine | PBS">public television in Nebraska</a> and traveled to museums around the country. Friedman always referred to Farritor as the exhibition engineer. </p></div><p><aside data-position="immersive-5" data-testid="_t_ad_"></aside></p><div gravitynodes="1" gravityscore="49"><p>Being around artists allowed Farritor to see “how they approach their careers, how they approach their lives,” he said in a <a href="https://news.unl.edu/article/farritor-engineers-musical-solution-for-art-exhibit" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" title="Farritor engineers musical solution for art exhibit | University of Nebraska - Lincoln">university news story</a>. “It really rubbed off on me, I think.” He considered becoming an artist. He started to create what he called an exploding toaster. “He was devising some things that he thought were kind of art pieces,” Friedman says. But at 21, after seven months as an intern at Musk’s SpaceX Starbase in Texas, he told Friedman he thought of himself differently: I realized what I love to do is to solve other people’s problems.</p></div><div style="--derived-width:100%"><div style="cursor:auto"><div style="max-width:1400px"><figure data-testid="_t_figure_"><div><noscript><img classname="css--image" loading="lazy" src="https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/i524kIq77nrE/v0/640x-1.jpg" style="margin: 0 auto; width: 100%"/></noscript><img alt="The installation of Charley Friedman's &lt;i&gt;Soundtracks for the Present Future&lt;/i&gt; at Bemis Center for Contemporary Arts in Omaha.

He had opportunities. He had people who cared about him, and those people had ideas of what he might achieve. Their ideas had nothing to do with Washington. Maybe Farritor didn’t know that his decision to help the man he so admired try to slash government spending would mean disappearing from his own life, working secretively but appearing in court documents. That it would mean disappointing and angering some, thrilling others. That in trying to solve one problem, he would play a part in creating chaos and distress and fear. Those he knew would not always be spared. His community in Lincoln would be cleaved. Maybe, some in his hometown say, he didn’t know there would be consequences.</p></div><div gravitynodes="1" gravityscore="96"><p>Luke Farritor is the eldest of four children, raised in a modest house with an American flag out front and a workshop in the basement. The family posed there for a photo. It’s on his father’s  Facebook page. Farritor’s mother, Tracy Slocum Farritor, is a physician who calls herself a patriot. She wanted to create an animated show, Renny &amp; Bo, about America’s history. <a data-terminal="BIO 3216319" data-terminal-type="PEOPLE" data-terminal-value="3216319">Michael Medved</a>, the conservative radio host and author, was a special consultant. “I think America is the greatest nation on Earth, and I think it’s OK to teach that,” she said in a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/rennyandbo/renny-and-bo" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" title="Renny &amp; Bo | Kickstarter">Kickstarter video</a> in 2015. “That doesn’t mean we think any less of other people or other countries.” Her campaign fell short. Farritor told friends she was the best person he knew. Second was his father, Shane Farritor, a mechanical engineering professor at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln who, for much of his son’s childhood, was developing a miniature surgical robot with millions of dollars in federal funding. It was l<a href="https://www.cnn.com/videos/us/2024/02/14/surgical-robot-operates-space-nasa-mira-fisher-tsr-vpx.cnn" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" title="Video shows surgeons remotely controlling robot to perform simulated surgery in space | CNN">aunched on SpaceX’s Falcon 9</a> and tested on the International Space Station last year. In a talk titled “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvI_nxbr0ZA" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" title=" Don’t Measure, Cut Twice | Shane Farritor | TEDxLincoln">Don’t Measure, Cut Twice</a>,” he said everyone should make something. “Making is a better way of thinking.” At the end, he showed photos of his four kids doing just that.</p></div><div gravitynodes="1" gravityscore="42"><p>Lincoln is a university town, the capital of the state, center of the Silicon Prairie. It’s open skies, affordable homes, good schools, liberal-leaning politics, refugee resettlement programs, some 300,000 residents. It’s about five hours by plane from either coast, and, for some, this is an opportunity of geography, a chance to distinguish themselves. Shane Farritor is among them. <a data-terminal="BIO 1402408" data-terminal-type="PEOPLE" data-terminal-value="1402408">Jeff Raikes</a> is too. He grew up in rural Nebraska, left for Stanford University, <a data-terminal="MSFT US Equity" data-terminal-type="SECURITY" data-terminal-value="MSFT US Equity">Microsoft</a>, the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. He designed, and later helped fund, the Jeffrey S. Raikes School of Computer Science and Management at the university, an honors program with an honor code. </p></div><div gravitynodes="1" gravityscore="33"><p>The students—their number hovers close to 40 a year now—are called the best and brightest. The university publishes their names; the Nebraska business community takes notice. Posters of the Raikes School’s <a href="https://raikes.unl.edu/school/raikes-school-core-values/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" title="Raikes School Core Values | University of Nebraska - Lincoln">six core values</a> hang in the building where the students live and study. Graduates can still recite them. Among the principles: Follow through on your commitments. Understand the impact of your words and actions. Never sacrifice quality or integrity. Commit to empathy. The school maintains a robust diversity, equity and inclusion statement.</p></div><div gravitynodes="1" gravityscore="26"><p>Every alum lands a job or a place in a graduate program soon after leaving Raikes, according to the school. For most, being selected for Cohort 2020 was an achievement in and of itself. For Luke Farritor, it was the path of least resistance, he later told a reporter. </p></div><div gravitynodes="1" gravityscore="20"><p>It was also close to home. During his first year, he invited friends to campfires there. Farritor’s family would sometimes join the parties. Friedman describes them as open-minded, intelligent, sparkly—the kind that a homeschooled kid might want to stay around. </p></div><div gravitynodes="1" gravityscore="43"><p>Members of Cohort 2020 came to realize that, unlike them, Farritor was at Raikes because his parents wanted him to attend. “School was never a priority for Luke, and that was well understood,” one classmate says. Unlike them, Farritor challenged professors about assignments and skipped classes (to work on the music project, to work on the scrolls). “It’s what kind of set him apart, because he would just grind on side projects and learn,” says another classmate. He calls Farritor “cracked.” For coders, that’s a compliment.</p></div><div gravitynodes="1" gravityscore="49"><p>Farritor didn’t always invest himself in group projects, some classmates say. Raikes is supposed to be all about collaboration. The program culminates in a project meant to solve a real problem for a company or organization. In November of his senior year, Farritor told his group that he would likely drop out before theirs was complete, according to one of them. They did just fine without him, winning second prize at what’s known as the Design Studio Showcase. It’s held at the Nebraska Innovation Campus, where Farritor’s father helped plan a makerspace for the university and the Lincoln community. </p></div><div gravitynodes="1" gravityscore="39"><p>Farritor—no surprise—set up a workshop of his own in his dorm room. “I had a suspicion that if I needed a part for anything, there was a 90% chance he would have it,” says a classmate who asked him for help with her own side project. “His room was full of little wires, computer chip boards, mini embedded system computers, things in boxes.” They mostly talked about coding. “Luke would share ideas for how I could learn on my own,” she says. </p></div><div gravitynodes="1" gravityscore="44"><p>Some other students had different recollections of Farritor: that he once redid a female classmate’s work on a project without consulting her; that he questioned the need for an international conference for women in tech that Raikes sent students to attend. When he dropped out, a few women noted with some satisfaction that his departure tilted the gender balance: At graduation it was 19 men and 18 women, as close to equal as it had been since the school’s founding in 2001. </p></div><div gravitynodes="1" gravityscore="54"><p>On Politichat, a group chat set up by Raikes students, Farritor identified himself as “hopelessly libright.” That’s “lib” for libertarian. “He would be passionate about being contrary,” says one classmate. “I don’t know the extent that he believed in some of the things. He just wanted to push people.” That wasn’t always welcome. Like a lot of group chats, it became a “pretty rough echo chamber,” wrote one classmate who created a private chat, Calm Politichat, to allow dissenting opinions to be heard more openly. Farritor was invited to join. He was there, he was on Twitter, he was on YouTube and TikTok and Instagram and GitHub. He was almost 19.</p></div><span><div style="display:block"><div><aside gravitynodes="1" gravityscore="3.0" style="font-family:'BWHaasDingbat', 'BW Haas Text Mono B', monaco, 'Courier', monospace;font-weight:500"><p></p><div gravitynodes="1" gravityscore="6"><br/><p>Luke Farritor, Nov. 16, 2020Calm Politichat</p><p>“I think college as a whole is overrated… Peter theil [sic] had a good bit about this”</p></div></aside></div></div></span><div gravitynodes="1" gravityscore="64"><p>Farritor’s political discussion seemed to mirror his own Twitter feed—among its prominent figures were the Silicon Valley venture capitalist <a data-terminal="BIO 1497974" data-terminal-type="PEOPLE" data-terminal-value="1497974">Marc Andreessen</a>, who would go all in for <a data-terminal="BIO 1252249" data-terminal-type="PEOPLE" data-terminal-value="1252249">Donald Trump</a> in 2024; <a data-terminal="BIO 1968401" data-terminal-type="PEOPLE" data-terminal-value="1968401">Peter Thiel</a>, the libertarian who helped fund Trump’s first campaign; and Elon Musk. “He thought that Musk was the closest thing to Iron Man. He loved that Musk was pushing the envelope in all these ways,” says one classmate. “I remember at one point Musk was going on a big series about how everyone needs to have more children,” says another. “Farritor started talking about that in Politichat. I remember thinking: ‘Why is this something we’re talking about?’ What he talked about was based on the whims of his algorithms. We were participating more in university life.” </p></div><div gravitynodes="1" gravityscore="49"><p>Farritor’s circle at Raikes telescoped over the years. “I think I could describe him as becoming more narrow,” a classmate once close to him says. By the time he dropped out, some from those campfires weren’t talking with him regularly, or at all. Most of those who had remained in touch didn’t respond to our requests for interviews. One works for <a data-terminal="8172854Z US Equity" data-terminal-type="SECURITY" data-terminal-value="8172854Z US Equity">Virtual Incision</a>, the robotics company Farritor’s father co-founded; a second recently left.

The volcano that destroyed Pompeii in 79 A.D. also preserved a vast library of ancient scrolls, the Herculaneum papyri, but they were so brittle that most have never been opened. A computer scientist at the University of Kentucky, Brent Seales, had figured out how to virtually unwrap 3D scans of the charred scrolls and, with his graduate students, train artificial intelligence algorithms to detect the presence of ink. Now they were making those scans and data available and offering prizes to anyone who could extract the first words and passages. “I think there’s like a 50% chance that someone will encounter this opportunity and get the data and get nerd sniped by it, and we’ll solve it this year,” Friedman said. And Farritor was like, “Oh my goodness, that could be me.” He thought to himself, “You can win money, you can meet Nat Friedman, you can make an impact on history.” </p></div><div gravitynodes="1" gravityscore="15"><p>Farritor began working with the scans during evenings and weekends, posting his progress on the group’s Discord, GitHub and sometimes Twitter. So did some 1,500 other people. Businessweek called them a volunteer army of nerds.</p></div><div gravitynodes="1" gravityscore="53"><p>In mid-October, Farritor accepted the First Letters Prize, and a $40,000 check, at a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0EsoAbRk1M" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" title="Announcement on Herculaneum Scrolls Breakthrough | YouTube">press conference</a> at the University of Kentucky. He’d found the word “porphyras,” or purple. “It’s a funny story,” he said. Late one August evening, he was at a friend’s birthday party, sitting in a corner. He got a text alerting him to a new piece of a scroll to work with and ran his detection algorithm on it. When he checked his phone later, he could make out three letters. His reaction: “Oh my goodness.” “Holy cow.” “I just completely freaked out, I almost fell over, I almost cried.” He sent a screenshot to JP Posma, who was managing the contest, and to his family. </p></div><div style="--derived-width:100%"><div style="cursor:auto"><div><figure data-testid="_t_figure_"><div><noscript><img classname="css--image" loading="lazy" src="https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iKgosHYnMcS8/v0/640x-1.jpg" style="margin: 0 auto; width: 100%"/></noscript><img alt="Farritor’s work on the Herculaneum papyri." data-sizes="auto" data-srcset="https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iKgosHYnMcS8/v0/220x-1.jpg 220w, https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iKgosHYnMcS8/v0/480x-1.jpg 480w, https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iKgosHYnMcS8/v0/640x-1.jpg 640w, https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iKgosHYnMcS8/v0/720x-1.jpg 720w, https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iKgosHYnMcS8/v0/960x-1.jpg 960w, https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iKgosHYnMcS8/v0/1020x-1.jpg 1020w, https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iKgosHYnMcS8/v0/1200x-1.jpg 1200w, https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iKgosHYnMcS8/v0/1280x-1.jpg 1280w, https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iKgosHYnMcS8/v0/1400x-1.jpg 1400w, https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iKgosHYnMcS8/v0/1800x-1.jpg 1800w, https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iKgosHYnMcS8/v0/2000x-1.jpg 2000w, " data-testid="_t_image_" draggable="true" loading="lazy" src="https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iKgosHYnMcS8/v0/640x-1.jpg"/></div><div><figcaption data-testid="_caption_credit_"><p>Farritor’s work on the Herculaneum papyri. <p>Source: Vesuvius Challenge</p></p></figcaption></div></figure></div></div></div><div gravitynodes="1" gravityscore="28"><p>Onstage, Farritor said the next challenge—to identify four passages by the end of the year for the Grand Prize—was absolutely doable.

The group, part of the Executive Office of the President, had been bringing in tech experts to help modernize the government since 2014. It was the gateway for those joining DOGE. In November, Farritor sent his résumé with a one-line note: “Super passionate about serving my country in the U.S.D.S.!”</p></div><div gravitynodes="1" gravityscore="68"><p>“Luke’s résumé didn’t pass muster,” says a former senior government official who requested anonymity for fear of retaliation for discussing the hiring of Farritor and other DOGE members. “It’s not to say he isn’t smart.” But the USDS required applicants to have a college degree and at least five years of industry experience. “You have to bring some expertise. It’s not just like, ‘Oh, I wrote a Python AI thing.’ Yeah, that’s not gonna cut it.” The official says that many of the younger software engineers who’d been approved by DOGE would have been rejected by USDS: “They actually don’t have the wisdom from having burned your fingers a number of times.” And, the official says, they hadn’t developed an essential skill. “It is as important to be able to influence people in power as it is to write code.”</p></div><div gravitynodes="1" gravityscore="20"><p>The official also knew that none of that mattered. The USDS wasn’t supposed to conduct its usual screening for Farritor or the others: “We had to make sure we didn’t throw out people we shouldn’t.” </p></div><div gravitynodes="1" gravityscore="34"><p>We reached out to the White House about DOGE’s hiring practices. In an email, spokesperson <a data-terminal="BIO 24724413" data-terminal-type="PEOPLE" data-terminal-value="24724413">Harrison Fields</a> wrote: “DOGE rigorously evaluated its technical and engineering talent by administering an industry-standard coding exercise, which validated every member of the DOGE team’s capabilities and skill set.

Please reach out if interested!” Thirteen of the 19 other fellows responded with heart and dog face emojis. </p></div><div gravitynodes="1" gravityscore="26"><p>In the weeks ahead of Trump’s inauguration, Farritor went dark. He disappeared from GitHub, TikTok, Instagram and YouTube. On LinkedIn, his location is Antarctica. He played online chess as lukeb0i on Jan. 7, his last game for months.

Luke Farritor was among them. They were easy to mock, maybe to fear: They were <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-government-young-engineers/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">young</a> and inexperienced, all male, part of another army of nerds.

I think part of what confused everybody was that you had these foot soldiers you were seeing and you assumed that they were there just to support the generals, but they weren’t. The generals had delegated everything to the foot soldiers.”</p></div><div gravitynodes="1" gravityscore="33"><p>On Friday, Jan. 31, Farritor was invited to an “urgent meeting” about the US Agency for International Development. Over the weekend, Musk called the agency, which provides humanitarian assistance to millions of the world’s poorest people, a criminal organization and a viper’s nest full of radical-left Marxists who hate America. After midnight on that Sunday, he wrote on X: “We spent the weekend feeding USAID into the wood chipper. Could gone to some great parties. Did that instead.” </p></div><div gravitynodes="1" gravityscore="19"><p>The New York Times reported that Farritor had sent an email to DOGE colleagues in the days before. He’d conducted a review of USAID payments made after Trump had ordered the agency to pause development spending. “I could be wrong,” Farritor wrote. “My numbers could be off.”</p></div><div gravitynodes="1" gravityscore="24"><p>The great undoing, with its firings, humiliation, lacerating and gloating, received a lot of gleeful encouragement on X. But in the days to come, someone posted “traitor” under Farritor’s TikTok videos. Someone on Discord warned him that the internet “hates fascists.” Another that he would end up in prison. </p></div><div gravitynodes="1" gravityscore="77"><p>In Lincoln, some came out in support of DOGE and Farritor, appreciated what they called his sacrifice, looked forward to what they hoped would be a smaller government with fewer regulations. That Sunday night, Scott Henderson, who mentors young entrepreneurs and knows the Farritors, wrote an email to Farritor’s father. He says he asked something like: Is this true? As a father of a son the same age, you can do something about this. If this is true, what are you going to do about this? He didn’t get a response. Charley Friedman checked in and didn’t hear back either. “Fascist” appeared in the comments to a LinkedIn post by Shane Farritor that had nothing to do with his son. A talk he was supposed to give at the Nebraska Innovation Studio a few days later—Lab to Launch—was canceled after online threats to disrupt it.</p></div><div gravitynodes="1" gravityscore="54"><p>A fight broke out in the Great Ferriter Family Facebook group, a forum with 900 members, including Luke and Shane. (The group’s page notes that “Ferriter is variously spelled as Ferriter, Farritor, Ferreter, or Feirtear or even other spellings.”) One view of DOGE: “It’s a department within the current US administration that a young family member was appointed to because of his brilliance and achievements.” Another: “It’s a collection of unqualified cyber criminals led by a South African immigrant who is illegally accessing private information.” None of the Lincoln Farritors got involved. Luke’s uncle, Pat Farritor, did speak with the <a href="https://flatwaterfreepress.org/from-unl-to-doge-nebraska-prodigys-role-in-musk-overhaul-shocks-pleases-back-home/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" title="From UNL to DOGE: Nebraska prodigy’s role in Musk overhaul shocks, pleases back home | Flatwater Free Press">Flatwater Free Press</a> in February: “Obviously he’s a lot smarter than you and I,” he said of his nephew, “and I know he’s going to make the right decisions.” When we called recently, he declined to comment. </p></div><div gravitynodes="1" gravityscore="77"><p>The moderators of a Discord server for Raikes alumni and students banned Farritor: “Luke has gone from simply disagreeing with many of us to actively fighting to hurt us in a position of governmental power.” Former classmates were surprised he had joined DOGE. Some were disturbed, some angry, some proud. “Luke doesn’t represent Raikes, and he isn’t a product of it,” says one. “It felt cool for someone from the Raikes School to be in the limelight,” says another. “Then it very quickly turned to a little bit of concern.” A third texted Farritor something like: Hey man, saw the news and am rooting for you. Farritor replied something like: Thank you. Hope you and your family are doing well. Even some who believed he was doing harm were still concerned enough to inquire about him: Thanks, I’m OK.</p></div><div gravitynodes="1" gravityscore="16"><p>But when a former friend posted an article critical of Farritor and DOGE on Instagram, Farritor replied with a meme of a crying baby and the caption: “When the corrupt elites can’t access USAID anymore.” Farritor was blocked by that account too. </p></div><div gravitynodes="1" gravityscore="36"><p>The day after the Wired story came out, Nat Friedman posted on X: “Luke Farritor is a national treasure.” Musk replied: “The quality of the @DOGE Team is epic.” When we reached out to Friedman, he didn’t respond. Another investor who runs AI Grant asked the recipients not to speak with us either, according to a message we saw. None of the Thiel Fellows would comment about Farritor.

They sometimes walked the halls of Washington with Musk, who moved around with his own security guards. They bragged about how hard they were working. At first they slept on the sixth floor of the General Services Administration building; one supporter sent biotracking covers for their mattresses. Some moved into an Airbnb known as DOGE Town, dined out together. “They come as a group,” says the former senior government official. “That’s the whole DOGE thing. It’s all DOGE all the time. Like they’re literally not given the mental space to go have an independent life experience and perhaps reflect on what they’re doing.”</p></div><div gravitynodes="1" gravityscore="59"><p>They expected loyalty from government employees: What do you think of Musk? What do you think of his companies? Musk promised transparency, but they operated in secrecy. For the first month no one would confirm who was overseeing their efforts. Media reports named <a data-terminal="BIO 24533664" data-terminal-type="PEOPLE" data-terminal-value="24533664">Steve Davis</a>, who’d helped Musk cut costs at X and SpaceX, as being effectively in charge. DOGE members didn’t identify themselves when they came into an agency, government employees told us, and demanded access to sensitive data but wouldn’t explain why. They communicated on Signal, where they could make their messages disappear. They shielded their work from public-records review. No one from DOGE, including Musk and Davis, replied to our emailed questions about their work or Farritor. </p></div><div gravitynodes="1" gravityscore="29"><p>They were busy—and Farritor may have been among the busiest. “Good God. You’d see him and think that he must be harmless,” says a current government employee. “And I guess he would be if other people weren’t giving him an obscene amount of power and access and telling him to move fast and break things.” </p></div><div gravitynodes="1" gravityscore="30"><p>Farritor helped assess, slash or dismantle at least nine departments and agencies after USAID— the Offices of Personnel Management and of Management and Budget; the Departments of Education, Energy, Labor, and Health and Human Services; the National Science Foundation; the Federal Bureau of Investigation; and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau—according to interviews with dozens of current and former government employees, and lawsuits and records seen by Businessweek. </p></div><div gravitynodes="1" gravityscore="70"><p>On Friday, Feb. 7, Farritor and four other young men from DOGE walked onto the fourth-floor executive suite of the CFPB. Erie Meyer, who’d just resigned as the chief technologist and was packing up her office, could identify only one: Farritor. “I recognized him, because I have been a follower of artificial intelligence since the ’90s, and he worked on decoding the scroll, and he just looks extremely distinctive,” she says. Meyer noticed Farritor and others jiggling the handles of locked office doors, trying to get in. There may be workplaces where that would be acceptable, but it’s taboo in a law enforcement agency, she says. “We lock our office doors, because there may be extremely sensitive materials about ongoing investigations against publicly traded firms and victims and all sorts of things like that on our desks.” </p></div><div gravitynodes="1" gravityscore="42"><p>She approached the five: “Can I help you?” They said they were looking for some sort of document but didn’t elaborate. “I think they were surprised to have been confronted.” Farritor kept quiet. Meyer wanted to think the best of him. “I love historical mysteries. I was kind of like maybe this person cares about learning from our past mistakes or learning from the past to inform our future,” she says. “I was naively hopeful.”</p></div><div gravitynodes="1" gravityscore="13"><p>A little while later, in her car, waiting to exit the garage, her phone lit up with notifications. Musk had just posted on X: “CFPB RIP.” </p></div><div gravitynodes="1" gravityscore="44"><p>Some of Farritor’s classmates wondered about the power he seemed to have been given. “Like the entirety of DOGE is scary. It’s very much like going into government and dismantling the core foundations. It’s scary from that perspective. And it’s scary that it’s 22- and 23-year-olds doing it. And I’m saying this as a 23-year-old,” one classmate says. “Normally I think experience shouldn’t matter all that much. But for the government I would like people to have experience.”</p></div><div gravitynodes="1" gravityscore="41"><p>Farritor had at least eight email addresses. He worked in agency conference rooms, behind closed doors. He worked on “Defend the Spend,” a section of the DOGE website where agencies had to provide the rationale for every expense approval. He was regularly invited to connect, sync and catch up at online meetings with agency officials. He was also invited to a deposition prep meeting; he’s been referenced in at least 23 lawsuits. He was invited to join 17 others in the Vice President’s Ceremonial Office to update Vance on DOGE’s efforts. </p></div><span><div gravitynodes="26" gravityscore="472.5" style="display:block"><div><aside gravitynodes="1" gravityscore="10.0" style="font-family:'BWHaasDingbat', 'BW Haas Text Mono B', monaco, 'Courier', monospace;font-weight:500"><p></p><div gravitynodes="1" gravityscore="20"><br/><p>Elon Musk, Feb. 28, 2025<br/>Joe Rogan’s podcast</p><p>“The fundamental weakness of Western civilization is empathy … They’re exploiting a bug in Western civilization, which is the empathy response.

He was fired after telling a journalist that he was impressed by the efficiency of the Department of Veterans Affairs. He briefly encountered Farritor there. “You’re not going to get asked by Steve Davis to do this and then in the room be like, ‘I’m not going to do that.’ You’re going to be like, ‘Oh, I can totally pull that off in 15 minutes with some software that gets all these files from their computer so we can see what they’re doing.’”</p></div><div gravitynodes="1" gravityscore="64"><p>In a lawsuit filed in February, one former government employee calls the breadth of Farritor’s access to data at Health and Human Services “without precedent.” Another, Jeffrey Grant, who’d overseen consumer and insurance information at Medicare and Medicaid, calls it alarming. Farritor could get into systems used for payment management, grants, health-care accounting, acquisitions and human resources. He could get into the National Institutes of Health’s grant management and contract systems, as well as the Medicare and Medicaid acquisition system and its integrated data repository, which includes information on claims, beneficiaries and providers, according to the lawsuit’s records. He could access grants.gov and two contracting systems for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. On Signal chats, employees shared sightings of Farritor and his colleagues walking around Food and Drug Administration and NIH buildings, observing workers and asking what they did. Some employees told us they feared seeing his name on a video call or pop up in their inbox.</p></div><div gravitynodes="1" gravityscore="33"><p>Fear changed to loathing. “The DOGE team wasn’t what I expected,” says a current government employee who’s interacted with Farritor and other core members of DOGE. “Marketed as tech geniuses, yet they could barely keep up with basic tasks. In reality, they were overconfident, drunk on power and utterly clueless. They giggled and asked me how my day was going—right as they hit the keys to obliterate nearly a decade of my work. There wasn’t even a flicker of understanding or care. It wasn’t just the loss that gutted me. It was the audacity of their casual cruelty.”</p></div><p><aside data-position="immersive-8" data-testid="_t_ad_"></aside></p><div gravitynodes="1" gravityscore="-7"><p>Late April at the University of Nebraska in Lincoln: trees in bloom, the Bathtub Dogs a capella group singing near the Jackie Gaughan Multicultural Center, students playing cornhole.

The lobby displays the many patents he holds  and a version of the mini-robot launched into space. The surgical robot’s early development at the university was funded by $4.2 million in grants from the US Army, about $400,000 from NIH and $100,000 from NASA to prepare for that test mission aboard the International Space Station. During the pandemic, Virtual Incision secured a loan of about $262,000 from the Small Business Administration to pay staff salaries, and Farritor himself received a loan for close to $21,000. He, along with engineers at the company, helped design and manufacture face shields for Nebraska’s hospitals at the makerspace. Virtual Incision has raised more than $100 million in venture capital funding, by that measure making it one of Lincoln’s most successful companies already. It’s won approval by the FDA to begin marketing its robots for use in colon surgery. The company declined to comment for this story.</p></div><div gravitynodes="1" gravityscore="38"><p>Farritor does answer a knock on the front door of his home around dinnertime. He steps out, locks the door behind him. He’s stern, in jeans, a red UNL sweatshirt and baseball cap.

Then he heads off. </p></div><div gravitynodes="1" gravityscore="49"><p>That evening, the astrophysicist <a data-terminal="BIO 4283631" data-terminal-type="PEOPLE" data-terminal-value="4283631">Neil deGrasse Tyson</a> gives a talk—“The Cosmic Perspective”—at a performing arts center in Lincoln to mark Earth Day. It seats more than 2,000 people and is sold out. Early in his presentation, Tyson illustrates the power of exponential growth with a picture of Musk and an estimate of his wealth: $330 billion. The audience boos. At the conclusion of his talk, Tyson remains onstage to share a few thoughts about the government’s stance against NASA, against science. “We’ll go backward, and the rest of the world will move forward,” he says. “We’re supposed to make the next generation proud of us.” </p></div><div gravitynodes="1" gravityscore="32"><p>Shane Farritor—he’s Dr. Farritor on campus—briefly appears at the Raikes Design Studio Showcase later that week. It’s a big celebration, drawing professors and alumni, families, local business owners and executives, the Raikes board members and Jeff Raikes himself. The school’s executive director, Steve Cooper, had been welcoming earlier but said he couldn’t talk about Farritor. University rules. Raikes isn’t exactly eager to comment but does say: “Luke is a great talent. I wish he was still here.” </p></div><div gravitynodes="1" gravityscore="31"><p>At that time, DOGE had cut at least $28 million in federal grants for the university. This came after UNL itself had to cut $5 million from its budget because of diminished state funding, and the university system was preparing to cut as much as $20 million more. </p></div><div gravitynodes="1" gravityscore="49"><p>What was lost or disrupted this spring: A study of agricultural methods to help the poorest farmers around the world. A project to help Indigenous communities adopt traditional and sustainable farming to mitigate food insecurity. A project to “cultivate a diverse engineering workforce.” (The dean of Farritor’s department, who was overseeing that effort, didn’t respond to requests for comment.) A new program to recruit, pay for and otherwise support students from rural areas to return as teachers. “It’s a profound undermining of our future when we don’t invest in our young. That’s what our program is designed to do,” says one of its leaders, Amanda Morales. </p></div><div gravitynodes="1" gravityscore="93"><p>What was lost beyond the university: opportunity, says one of Shane Farritor’s childhood friends, Kirk Zeller. He runs two medical device companies and helps others get going. Those kinds of early-stage companies rely on funding from NIH and the Department of Defense. “Companies won’t make it when otherwise they might have,” he says. “All I do is raise money now, and it is brutal.” He, like many in Nebraska, believes the government should be more efficient and accountable. “But I think we’re all a little surprised by the execution,” he says of DOGE. “They could come out of this as villains or heroes. It’s a great concept and could be beneficial to every taxpayer, and if they get it on a good course, Luke could have a lot of opportunities afterward. If it continues in the way it is now, it’s going to be hard for him.” That, says Zeller, would be a shame. </p></div><div gravitynodes="1" gravityscore="34"><p>In February, Scott Henderson wrote that email to Farritor’s father: Please talk to your son.

Work had to halt. Even though most of the grant was restored, the money came too late. The film’s premiere in London this fall, hosted by the Herculaneum Society, had to be canceled. “I don’t even have the words to describe how backwards this is,” says Laura Azevedo, executive director of the Filmmakers Collaborative, which supports the documentary. </p></div><div gravitynodes="1" gravityscore="39"><p>“My project is redemptive.

Twenty men sat around the conference table, most in suits. The DOGE members were nervous, earnest, cocky. One who dropped out of Harvard University to join DOGE said: “Most of campus hates me now.” The host, Jesse Watters, asked: “Who is Big Balls?” Musk replied: “That should be obvious.” There was laughter around the table. Some noted that they’d encountered government workers who had great ideas and who wanted to make changes.
