<p>Four people were killed, including a New York City police officer, and one seriously injured when a gunman opened fire inside a high-rise office building in Midtown Manhattan on Monday evening.</p>
<p>The gunman then fatally shot himself in the chest, New York City Police Commissioner Jessica S. Tisch said at a news conference Monday night. Speaking to reporters, Mayor Eric Adams called the incident “despicable” and an “act of evil.”</p>
