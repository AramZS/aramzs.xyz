<p>Revenue from sales of Ray-Ban <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/META">Meta</a> smart glasses more than tripled year over year, EssilorLuxottica revealed Monday as part of the company's most recent earnings <a href="https://www.essilorluxottica.com/cap/content/259500/">report</a>.</p>
<p>EssilorLuxottica said the success of the Ray-Ban Meta glasses, built via a partnership with the Facebook parent stemming back to 2019, contributed to its first-half overall sales of 14.02 billion euro (US$16.25 billion), which represents a 7.3% year-over-year jump.</p>
<p>"We are leading the transformation of glasses as the next computing platform, one where AI, sensory tech and a data-rich healthcare infrastructure will converge to empower humans and unlock our full potential," EssilorLuxottica CEO Francesco Milleri and deputy CEO Paul du Saillant said in a joint-statement. "The success of Ray-Ban Meta, the launch of Oakley Meta Performance AI glasses and the positive response to Nuance Audio are major milestones for us in this new frontier."</p>
<p>In the earnings report, the company said that its new Oakley Meta smart glasses, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/20/meta-essilorluxottica-oakley-smart-glasses-hstn.html">unveiled</a> in June, represents the latest product line to come from its partnership with the social media company. CNBC <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/20/meta-essilorluxottica-oakley-smart-glasses-hstn.html">reported</a> in June that Meta and Luxottica plan to debut a Prada-branded version of its smart glasses in the future.</p>
<p>Luxottica owns several well-known brands including Ray-Ban, Oakley, Vogue Eyewear and Persol.</p>
<p>In September, Meta renewed a <a href="https://www.essilorluxottica.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/essilorluxottica-and-meta-announce-long-term-partnership/">long-term partnership agreement</a> with Luxottica to "collaborate into the next decade to develop multi-generational smart eyewear products," according to the <a href="https://www.essilorluxottica.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/essilorluxottica-and-meta-announce-long-term-partnership/">announcement</a>.</p>
