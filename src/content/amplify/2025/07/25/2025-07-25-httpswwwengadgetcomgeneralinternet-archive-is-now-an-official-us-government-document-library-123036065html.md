<p>The US Senate has granted the <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" data-mrf-link="https://archive.org/" data-rapid_p="14" data-ylk="slk:Internet Archive;cpos:1;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://archive.org/">Internet Archive</a> federal depository status, making it officially part of an 1,100-library network that gives the public access to government documents, <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" data-mrf-link="https://www.kqed.org/news/12049420/sf-based-internet-archive-is-now-a-federal-depository-library-what-does-that-mean" data-rapid_p="15" data-ylk="slk:KQED;cpos:2;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://www.kqed.org/news/12049420/sf-based-internet-archive-is-now-a-federal-depository-library-what-does-that-mean">KQED</a> reported. The designation was made official in a <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" data-mrf-link="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kDxXsYfhc0QRMGBURP5X5JmfUftjIM_U/view" data-rapid_p="16" data-ylk="slk:letter;cpos:3;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kDxXsYfhc0QRMGBURP5X5JmfUftjIM_U/view">letter</a> from California Senator Alex Padilla to the Government Publishing Office that oversees the network. "The Archive's digital-first approach makes it the perfect fit for a modern federal depository library, expanding access to federal government publications amid an increasingly digital landscape," he wrote.</p>
<p>Established by Congress in 1813, the <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" data-mrf-link="https://libguides.fdlp.gov/c.php?g=871292" data-rapid_p="17" data-ylk="slk:Federal Depository Library Program;cpos:4;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://libguides.fdlp.gov/c.php?g=871292">Federal Depository Library Program</a> is designed to help the public access government records. Each congressional member can designate up to two libraries, which include government information like budgets, a code of federal regulations, presidential documents, economic reports and census data.</p>
<p>With its new status, the Internet Archive will be gain improved access to government materials, founder Brewster Kahle <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" data-mrf-link="https://blog.archive.org/2025/07/24/internet-archive-designated-as-a-federal-depository-library/" data-rapid_p="18" data-ylk="slk:said in a statement;cpos:5;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://blog.archive.org/2025/07/24/internet-archive-designated-as-a-federal-depository-library/">said in a statement</a>. "By being part of the program itself, it just gets us closer to the source of where the materials are coming from, so that itâ€™s more reliably delivered to the Internet Archive, to then be made available to the patrons of the Internet Archive or partner libraries." The Archive could also help other libraries move toward digital preservation, given its experience in that area.</p>
<p>It's some good news for the site which has faced legal battles of late. It was sued by major publishers over loans of digital books during the Coronavirus epidemic and was <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" data-mrf-link="https://www.engadget.com/internet-archive-violated-publisher-copyrights-by-lending-ebooks-court-rules-164629790.html" data-rapid_p="19" data-ylk="slk:forced by a federal court;cpos:6;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://www.engadget.com/internet-archive-violated-publisher-copyrights-by-lending-ebooks-court-rules-164629790.html">forced by a federal court</a> in 2023 to remove more than half a million titles. And more recently, <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" data-mrf-link="https://www.engadget.com/sony-and-other-music-labels-sue-internet-archive-for-digitizing-old-records-110108988.html" data-rapid_p="20" data-ylk="slk:major music label filed lawsuits;cpos:7;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-and-other-music-labels-sue-internet-archive-for-digitizing-old-records-110108988.html">major music label filed lawsuits</a> over its Great 78 Project that strove to preserve 78 RPM records. If it loses that case it could owe more than $700 million damages and possibly be forced to shut down.</p>
<p>The new designation likely won't aid its legal problems, but it does affirm the site's importance to the public. "In October, the Internet Archive will hit a milestone of 1 trillion pages," Kahle wrote. "And that 1 trillion is not just a testament to what libraries are able to do, but actually the sharing that people and governments have to try and create an educated populace."</p>
