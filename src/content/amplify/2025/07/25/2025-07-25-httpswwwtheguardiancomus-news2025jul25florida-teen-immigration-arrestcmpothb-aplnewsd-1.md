<h2 data-gu-name="standfirst">Video from Kenny Laynez-Ambrosio, 18, puts fresh scrutiny on the harsh tactics used to reach the Trump administration’s ambitious enforcement targets</h2>
<p>On the morning of 2 May, teenager Kenny Laynez-Ambrosio was driving to his landscaping job in North Palm Beach with his mother and two male friends when they were pulled over by the <a data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/florida">Florida</a> highway patrol.</p>
<p>In one swift moment, a traffic stop turned into a violent arrest.</p>
<p>A highway patrol officer asked everyone in the van to identify themselves, then called for backup. Officers with US border patrol arrived on the scene.</p>
<p>Video footage of the incident captured by Laynez-Ambrosio, an 18-year-old US citizen, appears to show a group of officers in tactical gear working together to violently detain the three men*, two of whom are undocumented. They appear to use a stun gun on one man, put another in a chokehold and can be heard telling Laynez-Ambrosio: “You’ve got no rights here. You’re a <em>migo</em>, brother.” Afterward, agents can be heard bragging and making light of the arrests, calling the stun gun use “funny” and quipping: “You can smell that … $30,000 bonus.”</p>
<p>The footage has put fresh scrutiny on the harsh tactics used by US law enforcement officials as the <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> sets ambitious enforcement targets to <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/29/trump-ice-arrest-quota">detain thousands of immigrants every day</a>.</p>
<p>“The federal government has imposed quotas for the arrest of immigrants,” said Jack Scarola, an attorney who is advocating on behalf of Laynez-Ambrosio and working with the non-profit Guatemalan-Maya Center, which provided the footage to the Guardian. “Any time law enforcement is compelled to work towards a quota, it poses a significant risk to other rights.”</p>
<h2>Chokeholds, stun guns and laughter</h2>
<p>The incident unfolded at roughly 9am, when a highway patrol officer pulled over the company work van, driven by Laynez-Ambrosio’s mother, and discovered that she had a suspended license. Laynez-Ambrosio said he is unsure why the van was pulled over, as his mother was driving below the speed limit.</p>
<p>Laynez-Ambrosio hadn’t intended to film the interaction – he already had his phone out to show his mom “a silly TikTok”, he said – but immediately clicked record when it became clear what was happening.</p>

<p>The video begins after the van has been pulled over and the border patrol had arrived. A female officer can be heard asking, in Spanish, whether anyone is in the country illegally. One of Laynez-Ambrosio’s friends answers that he is undocumented. “That’s when they said, ‘OK, let’s go,’” Laynez-Ambrosio recalled.</p>
<p>Laynez-Ambrosio said things turned aggressive before the group even had a chance to exit the van. One of the officers “put his hand inside the window”, he said, “popped the door open, grabbed my friend by the neck and had him in a chokehold”.</p>
<p>Footage appears to show officers then reaching for Laynez-Ambrosio and his other friend as Laynez-Ambrosio can be heard protesting: “You can’t grab me like that.” Multiple officers can be seen pulling the other man from the van and telling him to “put your fucking head down”. The footage captures the sound of a stun gun as Laynez-Ambrosio’s friend cries out in pain and drops to the ground.</p>
<p>Laynez-Ambrosio said that his friend was not resisting, and that he didn’t speak English and didn’t understand the officer’s commands. “My friend didn’t do anything before they grabbed him,” he said.</p>

<p>In the video, Laynez-Ambrosio can be heard repeatedly telling his friend, in Spanish, to not resist. “I wasn’t really worried about myself because I knew I was going to get out of the situation,” he said. “But I was worried about him. I could speak up for him but not fight back, because I would’ve made the situation worse.”</p>
<p>Laynez-Ambrosio can also be heard telling officers: “I was born and raised right here.” Still, he was pushed to the ground and says that an officer aimed a stun gun at him. He was subsequently arrested and held in a cell at a Customs and Border Protection (CBP) station for six hours.</p>
<p>Audio in the video catches the unidentified officers debriefing and appearing to make light of the stun gun use. “You’re funny, bro,” one officer can be overheard saying to another, followed by laughter.</p>
<p>Another officer says, “They’re starting to resist more now,” to which an officer replies: “We’re going to end up shooting some of them.”</p>
<p>Later in the footage, the officers move on to general celebration – “Goddamn! Woo! Nice!” – and talk of the potential bonus they’ll be getting: “Just remember, you can smell that [inaudible] $30,000 bonus.” It is unclear what bonus they are referring to. <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>’s recent spending bill includes <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/02/immigration-trump-big-beautiful-bill">billions of additional dollars</a> for Ice that could be spent on recruitment and retention tactics such as bonuses.</p>
<p>Laynez-Ambrosio said his two friends were eventually transferred to the Krome detention center in Miami. He believes they were released on bail and are awaiting a court hearing, but said it has been difficult to stay in touch with them.</p>
<p>Laynez-Ambrosio’s notice to appear in court confirms that the border patrol arrived on the scene, having been called in by the highway patrol. His other legal representative, Victoria Mesa-Estrada, also confirmed that border patrol officers transported the three men to the border patrol facility.</p>
<p>The Florida highway patrol, CBP, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement did not respond to requests for comment before publication.</p>
<h2>‘We are good people’</h2>
<p>Laynez-Ambrosio was charged with obstruction without violence and sentenced to 10 hours of community service and a four-hour anger management course. While in detention, he said, police threatened him with charges if he did not delete the video footage from his phone, but he refused.</p>
<p>Scarola, his lawyer, said the charges were retaliation for filming the incident. “Kenny was charged with filming [and was] alleged to have interfered with the activities of law enforcement,” he explained. “But there was no intended interference – merely the exercise of a right to record what was happening.”</p>
<p>In February, Florida’s governor, <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ron-desantis">Ron DeSantis</a>, signed an agreement between the state and the Department of Homeland Security allowing Florida highway patrol troopers to be <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2025/apr/30/trump-local-police-immigration">trained and approved by Ice</a> to arrest and detain immigrants. While such agreements have been inked across the US, Florida <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2025/apr/30/trump-local-police-immigration">has the largest concentration</a> of these deals.</p>

<p>Father Frank O’Loughlin, founder and executive director of the Guatemalan-Maya Center, the advocates for Laynez-Ambrosio, says the incident has further eroded trust between Florida’s immigrant community and the police. “This is a story about the corruption of law enforcement by Maga and the brutality of state and federal troopers – formerly public servants – towards nonviolent people,” he said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Laynez-Ambrosio is trying to recover from the ordeal, and hopes the footage raises awareness of how immigrants are being treated in the US. “It didn’t need to go down like that. If they knew that my people were undocumented, they could’ve just kindly taken them out of the car and arrested them,” he said. “It hurt me bad to see my friends like that. Because they’re just good people, trying to earn an honest living.”</p>
<ul> <li> <p>The Guardian is granting anonymity to Laynez-Ambrosio’s mother and the men arrested in the footage to protect their privacy</p></li> </ul>
