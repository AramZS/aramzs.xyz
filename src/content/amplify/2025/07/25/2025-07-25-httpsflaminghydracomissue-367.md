<h2>Let me tell you something, brother</h2>
<p>Pro wrestling is, in its structure, in its nature, a haven for thieves, rapists, murderers, con men, and perverts. Kayfabe—the great language and logic of pro wrestling—is, deep in its bones, based on ripping people off and making them like it.</p>
<p>In related news, Hulk Hogan is dead.</p>
<p>Until the late 1990s boom of Stone Cold Steve Austin and The Rock, Hulk Hogan was <em>the</em> biggest star in pro wrestling’s century-and-a-half-long history. He’s still the most immediately recognizable pro wrestler. If you ask someone on the street to name a wrestler, it’ll be Hulk Hogan (or maybe, if you ask some Zoomers like my daughter, John Cena). His look—hot-dog-casing skin, feathery blonde hair wisping away from a bald dome, steroidal beefiness—is eternal, already immortalized and lampooned in film, art, games, and stories.</p>

<p>Hogan is, by almost any measure, impossible to eulogize. Too important and rich and influential to remain unacknowledged, too terrible to gloss over. We don’t wish to speak ill of the dead, at least not in longform. Save that for social media, where the quips rush hard and the dopamine rushes harder, as it has all day today.</p>
<p>No one says he was a good wrestler. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkQjVT_uJ0U"><u>Half-hearted gestures toward his work in Japan aside</u></a>, he lumbered rather than strode, pointing and shouting (as all pro wrestlers do) with scarcely an ounce of the acrobatics and athleticism which typified his immediate successors such as Bret Hart and Shawn Michaels. He is even further from the modern crop of Kenny Omegas and Will Ospreays.</p>
<p>Hogan was not the most important pro wrestler of all time because of what he did in the ring but because of us. And we are sick. It’s both article of faith and trite observation that pro wrestling is the great American artform, the successor to vaudeville and circus alike, and that what we really see in it, per Barthes, is a clash of mythic giants enacting and reenacting the human psychodrama lurking under the surface of humanity. Pro wrestling is the heir to the plays of Sophocles and the echo of Zeus’ thunder. I wrote sentences like that once, across a decade as a writer about pro wrestling for a meager living.</p>
<p>Bullshit.</p>
<p>Pro wrestling is just pro wrestling and Hulk Hogan was just a pro wrestler, albeit the greatest one of all. Pro wrestling isn’t theater or film or poetry, and for all of our bleating about specificity in calling things what they are pro wrestling has somehow become <em>everything</em>. It is one thing, not all things.</p>
<p>You cannot have an honest profession where every term, every logic, is based on the con. <em>Work. Mark. Smart. Gimmick.</em> Call it acting if you want (you’re wrong) but acting has no such terms or such logics. Language <em>is</em> thought, <em>is</em> logic, <em>is</em> system, and it’s still there, working behind the scenes, and, yes, it works in the squeaky clean artists who serve as Hogan’s pro wrestling grandchildren. Give it time. You’re getting worked, still, in different ways. That’s the job description. Ask <a href="https://defector.com/cm-punk-loves-saudi-arabia"><u>CM Punk</u></a>.</p>
<p>Hogan made money, that’s why he was the greatest, and he primarily made it for himself, no matter who he had to step on to get it. Vince McMahon, the disgraced former owner of WWE, praised Hogan’s “<a href="https://x.com/VinceMcMahon/status/1948447498911072434"><u>grit and unbridled thirst for success</u></a>.” In a clip from the pro wrestling podcast WrestleMe, the hosts are in awe of Hogan as “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DX_XYkT4_Wc"><u>a brilliant operator</u></a>” when he made sure to metaphorically shiv Ultimate Warrior by stealing the limelight after their WrestleMania 6 match.</p>
<p>Ask some of the oldheads who didn’t die young, as many did—due, in part, to Hogan’s quashing of workers’ rights in pro wrestling—and they’ll say Hogan was the greatest of all time because he made the most money. That is “success.” Vague gestures toward “performance” and the crowds aside, pro wrestling success boils down to money, no matter who gets crushed to get it. Not being good at your job in any sort of mechanical sense and certainly not generosity or comradeliness, because Hogan rarely if ever gave much to those he performed with. All that we have is filthy lucre as a quantification of worth.</p>
<p>What an ethos for the age. What an aspirational mode of living. And it was all there from the 1980s onward, for anyone to see, a precursor to the terrible now of 2025.</p>
<p>Launder it as we may, there’s something monstrously important about the rise of Hulk Hogan and pro wrestling at the same time this country began its slow descent into a hell of financialization and retrenched obscurantism. Because what measure of success do we have left, aside from this? Minus the shirt-ripping, we’re all just miniature Hulk Hogans now. In the United States, the president’s sole criterion for success is how much money he makes through attention or grift. The megachurch down the road is the same. The college students trying to figure out how to skip their readings in favor of making a buck via Robinhood or TikTok, same.</p>
<p>The climax of Hogan's career came not in the ring but in the courtroom. After Gawker received a leaked sex tape of Hogan and published brief excerpts and an essay about it, <a href="https://popula.com/2023/02/01/the-gawker-trial-of-2016/">he sued the website for millions</a> with the secret backing of Peter Thiel. Again, it was all ominous and everyone with any power acted predictably. Gawker wasn’t a real news outlet and it was all in bad taste (Gawker was a real news outlet and it also was, very often, in bad taste). Just as with Gamergate, we all should’ve known, as some few of us did, that the revanchist pop culture eruptions of the years 2013-2016 portended something far more terrible to come. Peter Thiel basically bought the vice presidency and has the ear of the White House and cooks up dreams of microstates ruled by AI, while Hogan spent his last years shilling Trumpism from atop a mountain of lawsuit gold. Again, money and attention are now, were then, a singularity of awfulness.</p>
<p>Mehdi Hasan just <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S-WJN3L5eo"><u>sat in a circle getting abused by self-proclaimed fascists</u></a> on a YouTube channel called Jubilee. Everyone at the debate said the fascists “won,” though this view was not generally shared. One of the fascists was fired from his job, set up a GoFundMe, and made tens of thousands of dollars, directly. The video has 6.9 million views at the time of this writing.</p>
<p>Hulk Hogan sold out the Pontiac Silverdome; Jubilee got 6.9 million views.</p>
<p>So there’s my praise and it’s the praise everyone should say he deserves, because it’s their logic, not mine. He wasn’t a good man, but he was a successful one. He put butts in seats and made a lot of money. And that, really, is the only success anyone could ever need.</p>
<h3>HYDRAS ABROAD</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.thehandbasket.co/p/hulk-hogan-dead-anti-eulogy-josephine-riesman"><strong>Josephine Riesman</strong> over at <strong><em>The Handbasket</em></strong></a> today with a moving “anti-eulogy,” joining legions in censure of the late Hulk Hogan. We love <strong><em>The Handbasket!!</em></strong></p>
<blockquote>I had been a working journalist for over a decade when the <em>Bollea v. Gawker</em> decision came down, and I’ll never forget the terror I felt upon learning of it. It meant that I, and whoever was publishing me, were no match against surging American fascism. I was not alone in my fear. Gawker’s demise was a grim portent of Donald Trump’s war on, and capture of, the free press.<br/><br/>(Indeed, Trump just succeeded in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/22/trump-cbs-settlement-stephen-colbert?utm_source=www.thehandbasket.co&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=hulk-hogan-trump-idol-and-enemy-of-the-free-press-dead-at-71">using a lawsuit against CBS</a> to force the entirety of its parent corporation, Paramount, into a submissive position. Erstwhile Trump skeptics—and longtime billionaires—Jeff Bezos and Patrick Soon-Shiong have reorganized <em>The Washington Post</em> and <em>The Los Angeles Times</em>, respectively, into rabidly pro-Trump mouthpieces. And <em>The New York Times</em>, for all its protestations of journalistic independence, is now <a href="https://www.assignedmedia.org/breaking-news/amicus-briefs-cited-nyt-29-times?utm_source=www.thehandbasket.co&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=hulk-hogan-trump-idol-and-enemy-of-the-free-press-dead-at-71">regularly cited by the Trump administration in the latter’s legal battles against transgender existence</a>—the paper tends to agree with him on the issue.)<br/><br/>There was also the time Hulk Hogan <a href="https://www.thesportster.com/wwe-hulk-hogan-killed-jesse-ventura-plan-pro-wrestling-union-vince-mcmahon/?utm_source=www.thehandbasket.co&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=hulk-hogan-trump-idol-and-enemy-of-the-free-press-dead-at-71">scuttled</a> the only credible attempt WWF wrestlers ever made at unionization by ratting them out to McMahon. How many wrestlers died from negligence and desperation because Hogan prevented collective bargaining in pro wrestling? Jesse “The Body” Ventura <a href="https://consent.yahoo.com/v2/collectConsent?sessionId=3_cc-session_0ebdf096-d1d2-4763-91da-c22cbc176130&amp;utm_source=www.thehandbasket.co&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=hulk-hogan-trump-idol-and-enemy-of-the-free-press-dead-at-71">still hasn’t forgiven him for that one</a>, nor should you.</blockquote>
