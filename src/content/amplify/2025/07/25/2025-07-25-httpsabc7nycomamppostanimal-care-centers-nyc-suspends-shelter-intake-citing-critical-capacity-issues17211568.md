<p>Lindsay Tuchman reports from Ridgewood, Queens.</p>
<p>NEW YORK (WABC) -- For the first time in their 30-year history, the <a data-target="_blank" href="https://www.nycacc.org/">Animal Care Centers of NYC</a> (ACC) have more than 1,000 animals in their care. They've had to suspend animal shelter pet intake due to "critical capacity issues," stating that they "are completely out of space."</p>
<p>ACC said they remain open for adoptions and emergency care, but they can no longer accept any animal drop-offs outside of those that require emergency medical care or that pose a public-safety risk, and those being dropped off by government agencies.</p>
<p>"This is not a decision we take lightly, but we cannot take any more owner surrenders. With over 1,000 pets in our care we are at a breaking point," ACC posted to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DMRZGqKsxMh/">social</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/reel/686206404395542">media</a>. "We're crying for help."</p>
<p>The organization is sending out a plea to New Yorkers, if they've ever considered adopting - now is the time to do so.</p>
<p>"What we're experiencing now is a lot of surrender for financial hardship and housing reasons. And as a result, we have more animals coming in than going out," the Risa Weinstock, CEO of ACC said.</p>

<p>Besides asking for more people to adopt, the ACC is also asking for more volunteers, more donations and most importantly, more fosters.</p>
<p>"Maybe want to help take a pet out of the shelter for a weekend for a week? For a month? We have lots of programs that just help get the dogs out temporarily," Weinstock said.</p>
<p>Currently, <a href="https://nycacc.app/#/browse">over 800 pets are available for adoption</a> on ACC's website.</p>
<p>The large animal welfare 501(c)(3) nonprofit says they aid over 15,000 animals yearly through their shelters and programs, providing medical care, adoption and foster services, and community resources to the greater New York City community.</p>
<p>"New Yorkers we need your help ... if you've ever considered helping, now is the time," the organization pleaded.</p>
<p>Their message to pet owners considering surrender: "We understand that giving up a pet is never an easy choice. But it's important to know that when shelters are full, even the most loving animals can be at risk. Please explore every option first: Ask family/friends for help ... try to rehome ... try to figure out a way to keep your pet. <a href="https://www.nycacc.org/services/surrender/#">We have resources that can help</a>."</p>
