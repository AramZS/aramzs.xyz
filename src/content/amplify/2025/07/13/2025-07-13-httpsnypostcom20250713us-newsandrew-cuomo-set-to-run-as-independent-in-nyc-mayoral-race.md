set to announce his run as an independent in the city’s mayoral race.

<p>Cuomo is going to unveil his independent candidate bid this week, <a href="https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/andrew-cuomo-to-run-as-independent-in-nyc-mayors-race-with-a-proposal/">sources told NewsNation</a>.</p>
<p>Cuomo spokesman Rich Azzopardi told The Post on Sunday, “There’ll be an official announcement soon.”</p>
<p>The rep noted that polls show Cuomo is the leading alternative to Mamdani among the candidates.</p>
<p>But there is a catch to Cuomo running as an independent.</p>
<p>After his announcement, Cuomo is going to ask all of the candidates — except for socialist Democratic <a href="https://nypost.com/2025/06/24/us-news/andrew-cuomo-concedes-as-zohran-mamdani-wins-nyc-mayoral-primary-in-stunning-upset/">nominee Zohran Mamdani</a> — to vow to drop out of the race come mid-September if they are not in the lead, himself included, a source close to the candidate told NewsNation.</p>

<p>The latest survey from political consulting firm Slingshot Strategies has Mamdani comfortably leading the pack with 35% of the vote, followed by Cuomo at 25%, Republican Curtis Sliwa in third with 14%, and Mayor Eric Adams in fourth with a paltry 11%.</p>
<p>Cuomo and Adams will now both run as independents on Nov. 4, after Hizzoner announced he would seek re-election in June following the dismissal of federal corruption charges against him.</p>
<p>Former federal prosecutor Jim Walden, who is also running as an independent in the race, spoke out Sunday after Cuomo’s announcement.</p>
<p>“I am glad Andrew has agreed to adopt my pledge. I hope Eric and Curtis sign on as well,” he told NewsNation in a statement. “Putting New York’s best interests over our personal ambitions is critical at this moment.</p>
<p>Sliwa, who lost to Adams in 2021’s election, slammed both the incumbent mayor and Cuomo.</p>
<p>“Andrew Cuomo lost his primary and hides in the Hamptons. Eric Adams skipped his and fled to Fort Lauderdale. Now, they’re both running as independents to cling to relevance,” he told The Post in a statement.</p>
<p>“I’m the only candidate with a major party nomination, a 50-year record of serving New Yorkers and a real path to victory. While they play musical chairs on a sinking ship, I’m out campaigning in NYC, listening, leading, and fighting to win it for the people. Let the voters decide this November,” Sliwa added.</p>
