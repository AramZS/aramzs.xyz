<p><strong>Hi,</strong></p>
<p><strong>I’m 33 years old Indian male. I’m 6ft and have great muscular physique as I’ve been lifting weights consistently for the last 15 years.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I work from home doing something similar to trading markets. I never dated in my life or went out on any dates or even had sex with any girls that wasn’t an escort. I got into the habit of seeing escorts/prostitutes from an early age of say 18.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Been seeing escorts ever since then and probably had sex with over 100 really good-looking women in this way. I’m only attracted to white women so all the escorts I had sex with were white. Some were attracted to me as I have great muscular physique and tall.</strong></p>
<p><strong>But I get down a lot as I’ve never dated or had sex with any girl that wasn’t an escort. There is no social validation that comes from having sex with escorts even if you are good at sex, good looking and some escorts find you very attractive.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I don’t go to bars and clubs as I don’t drink and I don’t like party scene. Unfortunately, online dating doesn’t work for me despite being 6ft and having a more muscular physique than 99% of men. As I believe this is because I’m only sexually attracted to white women and I am brown.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Most people date within their own race and this is more prevalent with online dating. It gets me down a lot as when I look at couples often the guy is short, has no muscles, etc. and I deem the man to be inferior to me.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I am narcissistic which probably developed from being socially isolated and alienated all my life and developing a me against the world mentality. It just seems that dating works best for white men in the whole, even men that are below average will do ok if they are white.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I’m 33, made 6 figures two years ago but last yr was in a bad mental state and didn’t do well. I’m just focusing now on building my finances well again over next few years. I am planning to try dating when I’m 35 or 36 but I don’t know how I will ever meet any white woman I’m attracted to start dating.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tried going to salsa class in past but didn’t meet any girls I was attracted to there and don’t really like salsa. I go to the gym around 5 times a week and I enjoy lifting weights but it’s not exactly a social activity other than getting compliments from other men about how good my body is. Tried some yoga classes as well but there is no interaction there between genders and they have separate changing rooms and showers for men and women.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I still have the aim of becoming a millionaire by the time I’m 40 which is definitely an achievable goal, But it all seems empty if I will never even be able to find any dates.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Seems like I will be 39 years old in 6 yrs, millionaire lets say by then with still a great muscular physique, 6ft tall and still never find anyone most likely due to my race and skin colour.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I have gotten into spirituality recently and it does says that in Buddhism they believe all of life is suffering and that preferences is what causes suffering. So if you have no preferences and no way you want things to be, no likes and no dislikes you can never suffer in life.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Is still tough all the time when I see couples and very often the man is inferior to me. Seems like I have been excluded from even having a chance to date or have sex that I don’t have to pay for.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Shut Out and Shut Down</strong></p>
<p>There are times when I get a letter where I truly don’t know where to start.</p>
<p>OK, let’s start with something obvious: yeah, <a href="https://www.doctornerdlove.com/im-struggling-to-date-because-of-racist-stereotypes-and-i-dont-know-what-to-do/">race plays a factor when it comes to dating</a>, and <a href="https://www.doctornerdlove.com/what-does-my-taste-in-sex-partners-say-about-me/">South and East Asian men in particular have had centuries of incredibly racist propaganda</a> and <a href="https://www.doctornerdlove.com/ask-dr-nerdlove-stop-hating-myself/">pop culture portraying them as effete and emasculated, as nerdy horny bumblers</a> or otherwise <a href="https://www.doctornerdlove.com/fear-of-being-invisible/">unsexy in various ways</a>, especially when it comes to trying to date white women. That sort of racism <em>is</em> going to present a significant head wind, particularly if you’re focused on online dating.</p>
<p>But as I’m often saying: difficult isn’t the same as “impossible”.</p>
<p>I would, however, remind you that <a href="https://www.doctornerdlove.com/episode-126-this-is-why-online-dating-sucks-and-5-ways-to-fix-it/">online dating sucks for pretty much <em>everyone</em></a>, since <a href="https://www.doctornerdlove.com/online-dating-makes-me-feel-awful-what-should-i-do/">the apps are primarily designed these days to frustrate you and get you to pay to be <em>less</em> frustrated</a>. It also doesn’t help when the male-to-female ratio is close to 70/30 on the more popular apps <em>and</em>, quite frankly, most men <em>really suck </em>at using the apps effectively. So, <em>part</em> of the problem is a skill issue.</p>
<p>Now that we’ve got that out of the way, let’s talk about a couple other issues that need to be addressed if you want to have better results.</p>
<p>The first is, simply, <a href="https://www.doctornerdlove.com/5-mistakes-that-push-people-away/">you’re not actually giving yourself many opportunities to <em>meet</em> women</a>, and when you <em>are</em>, you’re making it harder on yourself for no reason.</p>
<p>As a general rule, people tend to meet their partners through dating apps, <a href="https://www.doctornerdlove.com/the-surprising-secret-to-getting-dates-on-dating-apps/">through mutual friends, work, school or social settings</a>. While percentages vary depending on how one frames the question or defines terms, a plurality-to-majority tend to meet in person, and almost always through shared commonalities – you work together, you have friends in common, you go to the same school and so on. These all make that initial connection easier, simply because you <em>have </em>those things in common; <a href="https://www.doctornerdlove.com/5-ways-to-be-someone-women-want-to-date/">contrary to cliches and late 80s pop songs involving cartoon cats, opposites <em>don’t</em> attract</a>. We like people who are similar to us; the more we have in common, the more we tend to like them. And – importantly – commonalities covers a <em>lot</em> of territory; <a href="https://www.doctornerdlove.com/episode-149-how-do-you-know-if-shes-right-for-you/">it includes things like background, the region where you grew up, shared values, mutual interests and so on</a>. If you’ve ever bonded with someone because you both had a great conversation about a topic you’re particularly into, you know precisely how this works.</p>
<p>You work from home, which already restricts the number of people you come into contact with, and which means you have to put in additional effort in order to go meet people. You don’t go to bars or clubs, which is fine – that’s not how most people meet their partners… but they often <em>do</em> meet at parties, usually because there’s an overlap in social circles that brings them together. So while the “party scene” may not necessarily be your thing, <a href="https://www.doctornerdlove.com/how-to-pick-up-women-in-your-social-circle/">getting friends together on the regular or going to friends’ parties and celebrations will increase the number of people you’re meeting and who are more likely to have things in common with you</a>.</p>
<p>After all, if our friends tend to be similar to us, <a href="https://www.doctornerdlove.com/ask-dr-nerdlove-how-to-handle-lets-just-be-friends/">then their <em>other</em> friends are likewise going to have a higher number of shared values, interests and backgrounds</a> – increasing the likelihood that you and they would get along.</p>
<p>The power of similarity and shared commonalities <em>also</em> comes into play when meeting complete strangers at social events or classes. <a href="https://www.doctornerdlove.com/this-is-the-best-way-to-meet-women/">Part of why we talk about having hobbies and passions you pursue is that these give you opportunities to meet <em>other</em> people who have the same interests – including people who you may well want to date</a>. But the important part is to pursue things <em>you actually enjoy</em> and to do them <em>because</em> you enjoy them, not because you’re horny and looking to hook up.</p>
<p>This is one of the reasons why you struck out at salsa and yoga; not only do you <em>not</em> enjoy those activities – which is going to put you in a less pleasant and agreeable mood – but <a href="https://www.doctornerdlove.com/break-out-of-your-box/">these have become some of the cliches of modern dating</a>. It’s hard to overstate how many women complain about men coming to dance classes or yoga, <a href="https://www.doctornerdlove.com/5-mistakes-that-men-make-approaching-women/">not because they want to learn how to dance or practice yoga, but to circle around all the women like horny sharks</a>. The guys who do this are <em>clearly</em> only there to hit on women and inevitably make everyone uncomfortable. This means that women are less likely to want to talk to you and <em>more</em> likely to stop going entirely.</p>
<p>It gets worse when you clearly don’t <em>enjoy </em>the activity or the subject. Not only is that going to affect your mood – which will have a negative effect on meeting people – but it makes it that much more obvious that you’re there to treat it like a sex ATM and not a class. That’s going to take people who already have a reason to be defensive and help ensure that they aren’t going to talk to you more than they absolutely must.</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean that it’s not <em>possible</em> to meet women at dance classes or yoga or what-have-you; people do that all the time. The issue is that <em>you</em> are going about it in ways that stack up so many debuffs and disadvantages that you’re reducing your odds so much that I’m not sure science has numbers to calculate them.</p>
<p>Now there <em>are</em> ways to leverage your interests. If you, for example, started taking a Pilates class – your gym may well have them – you’d be closer to an interest you already have (weight lifting), in an environment where you feel fairly comfortable. But you would have to go <em>specifically</em> because you want to add a new form of exercise to your workouts, not to get laid. As I said: women aren’t stupid and they can spot the horny dudebros right away. But by actually participating in the class and just making small talk – not asking people out but just <em>getting to know them</em> as – as you become a regular in the class, people will realize pretty quickly that you’re there for the right reasons. From there, it becomes a lot easier to get to know people, make friends and, if you and someone else catch a vibe, ask someone out to grab juice or coffee after class.</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://www.doctornerdlove.com/im-good-at-getting-numbers-so-why-cant-i-get-dates/">these connections tend to come about far more organically and <em>slowly</em>, developing as you go from strangers to acquaintances,</a> and I have to wonder if, based on a lot of what you say here, you’re coming off like a runaway bulldozer. A lot of guys act like this, just plowing through things with no control, care or precision. Part of it may be expecting things to be as quick or convenient as seeing sex workers. <a href="https://www.doctornerdlove.com/ashamed-of-visiting-an-escort/">That’s great for immediate gratification, but less so when it comes to building social skills for meeting people you might want a relationship with.</a></p>
<p>Very few people, after all, start a relationship with someone they just met or only met very recently. Even when meeting on dating apps, there tends to be a lot of talking and feeling one another out before the first official “date” happens. If you have a tendency to come in hot, you’re going to be failing the vibe check long before you even get to the part of saying “hey, I’m really enjoying talking to you, can I give you my number?”</p>
<p>(Also, as a complete aside: you <em>do</em> realize that “many of these escorts were attracted to me” is functionally the same as <a href="https://www.doctornerdlove.com/does-she-really-like-me-or-is-it-a-trick/">“the stripper <em>really</em> likes me”,</a> right? Sure, maybe you’re better looking than many of her clients, but <a href="https://www.doctornerdlove.com/episode-100-is-she-flirting-or-just-being-friendly/"><em>you’re still a client</em> and flattering the client’s ego is part of the job</a>.)</p>
<p>But I think the <em>biggest</em> issue is that, as happens so frequently, <a href="https://www.doctornerdlove.com/what-men-need-to-know-about-attraction/">you’re <em>wrong </em>about what’s important to women</a>. You, like <em>so many</em> men who’ve written in, are focused on <a href="https://www.doctornerdlove.com/what-do-men-think-makes-men-attractive/">qualities that <em>other men</em> think are important because those are qualities that <em>men </em>admire</a>. In fact, the thing that drives me nuts about your letter is <em>you are so very close</em> to having a profound realization, and you keep missing the point. You even say it <em>multiple times</em>: you keep seeing happy couples where the man is “inferior” to you, and yet somehow you keep trying to double down on what’s <em>not</em> working.</p>
<p>Have you considered that maybe, <em>just maybe</em>, you got this one wrong and need to change things up a little?</p>
<p>Yeah, race is a factor, but being white isn’t the trump card for everything else. These guys – these schlubby short kings who don’t have six figure bank accounts – aren’t with their wives and girlfriends because they’re white enough that the rest doesn’t matter. <a href="https://www.doctornerdlove.com/what-makes-a-man-attractive-to-women/">Those women are with them because <em>those guys have qualities that women want, </em>and as it turns out, that doesn’t mean height, muscles and money.</a></p>
<p>Is height attractive? Sure, lots of people like tall guys. But attractiveness isn’t the exclusive province of the tall. Internet Boyfriend Du Jour Pedro Pascal is 5’10”, and Oscar Isaac – last year’s model – is 5’9”; you would be hard pressed to find women who’d kick them out of bed because of some “you must be THIS tall to ride” sign by the door.</p>
<p>The same with being jacked as hell. While women are visual creatures too and can appreciate a fit guy, they aren’t going to care about or wax rhapsodic over an incredibly developed back and traps, nor comment on them… but <em>men</em> sure as hell will.</p>
<p>(Now, strong hands and forearms… wooooo nurse, that’ll get you places.)</p>
<p>And as for being a millionaire by 40… I mean, good luck and God speed, but <a href="https://www.doctornerdlove.com/become-someone-worth-dating/">the people who are going to care most about that are people who are interested in <em>money</em> or being kept in a particular lifestyle to which they intend to become accustomed</a>. Most women are going to be more concerned that you’ve got your shit together, you can cover your share of the bills and not wreck <em>their</em> credit rating.</p>
<p>In fact, women are going to care a lot more about a guy who’s kind, who actually <em>likes</em> them and who makes them laugh and feel good. This is why <a href="https://www.doctornerdlove.com/what-makes-a-man-attractive-to-women/">you’ll see dudes who look like rats who got exposed to radioactive waste and sell meth behind the Waffle House between shifts who have a <em>wait list</em> for women who want to bang them</a>, while there’re a <em>lot</em> of guys who supposedly check all the boxes spending their weekends alone. Being rich is nice, but it ain’t gonna make up for a lack of chemistry or social skills. Neither will height or muscles. Or, for that matter, <em>not being a self-proclaimed narcissist with a chip on his shoulder</em>, complaining about “inferior” men.</p>
<p>(Also, you’re misinterpreting Buddhism and what desire being the cause of suffering is actually about, but that’s neither here nor there.)</p>
<p>Seriously, 90% of your problem comes down to “<strong>I am narcissistic which probably developed from being socially isolated and alienated all my life and developing a me against the world mentality.” </strong>These are the things you should be working on, because I can promise you, women can <em>sense</em> this on you. <a href="https://www.doctornerdlove.com/how-do-i-stop-resenting-people-who-are-better-with-women-than-me/">There’s a lot of entitlement and resentment that’s radiating off you like stink lines off a cartoon character</a>. That’s gonna make sex <em>vanish</em> like it got Thanos-snapped out of existence, no matter how yoked you are.</p>
<p>Here’s the thing that you should know: <em>all</em> the sex-gettingest men I have met – who have had more partners than you’ve had hot dinners – have had in common: <a href="https://www.doctornerdlove.com/why-do-women-love-himbos/"><em>they genuinely like people</em>. They’re fun to hang out with, they treat people well and folks enjoy their company</a>. Some were fit, some were <em>obese</em>. Some were tall, some were 5’4” even in cowboy boots. Some were classically good looking and <a href="https://www.doctornerdlove.com/how-do-i-date-when-im-this-ugly/">some had a face like a bulldog licking piss off a thistle</a>. But while their charisma presented in different ways and their technique was as varied as the individuals themselves, <em>they liked people</em>. They were friendly, open and warm and rarely if ever lacked for a date on Saturday night.</p>
<p>If you want to do better with women, I suggest you make getting over that bitterness a priority while also working on developing your social skills. Otherwise, you’re going to have gym-sculpted muscles, a lovely penthouse with prime views and every sports car you ever dreamed of… and absolutely nobody to share it with.</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>
