<p>A federal trial underway in Boston is raising questions about how U.S. <a data-id="https://www.nbcboston.com/tag/immigration/" data-type="link" href="https://www.nbcboston.com/tag/immigration/">immigration</a> authorities are identifying and targeting pro-Palestinian activists through an anonymous website that critics say conflates political speech with hate.</p>
<p>Canary Mission publishes profiles of students, professors, and activists it labels as anti-Israel or antisemitic.</p>
<p>The U.S. government <a data-id="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/dhs-used-anonymous-israel-site-target-activists-deportation-agency-say-rcna217814" data-type="link" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/dhs-used-anonymous-israel-site-target-activists-deportation-agency-say-rcna217814">admitted in court this week</a> that Immigration and Customs Enforcement relied on Canary Mission's database to identify and detain people including Tufts University graduate student <a data-id="https://www.nbcboston.com/tag/rumeysa-ozturk/" data-type="link" href="https://www.nbcboston.com/tag/rumeysa-ozturk/">Rumeysa Ozturk</a>, whose arrest earlier this year sparked national outcry.</p>
<p>"All along, we suspected that top U.S. government agencies are relying on a shadowy, secret organization," said Mahsa Khanbabai, Ozturk's immigration attorney.</p>
<p>Ozturk was <a data-id="https://www.nbcboston.com/news/local/international-student-at-tufts-reportedly-taken-into-federal-custody-school-says/3668101/" data-type="link" href="https://www.nbcboston.com/news/local/international-student-at-tufts-reportedly-taken-into-federal-custody-school-says/3668101/">taken into ICE custody in March</a> when she was approached by plainclothes agents in in Somerville, Massachusetts. The incident was caught on video.</p>
<p>She was held for six weeks. The <a data-id="https://www.nbcboston.com/tag/trump-administration/" data-type="link" href="https://www.nbcboston.com/tag/trump-administration/">Trump administration</a> claimed she supported Hamas, but did not provide evidence. Supporters argued she was targeted after being one of four students with bylines on an <a data-id="https://www.tuftsdaily.com/article/2024/03/4ftk27sm6jkj" data-type="link" href="https://www.tuftsdaily.com/article/2024/03/4ftk27sm6jkj">op-ed in Tufts' school newspaper</a> calling for the university to divest from companies with ties to Israel.</p>
<p>An official with the Department of Homeland Security, the parent agency of ICE, testified in the trial involving a handful of universities challenging the administration's efforts to deport pro-Palestinian activists.</p>
<p>The official confirmed that more than 5,000 names were sourced from the website.</p>
<p>"That's really scary to think that law enforcement is using this secret organization's blacklist to target not only international students, but U.S. citizens, as well," Khanbabai added.</p>
<p>The case has sparked outrage among free speech advocates, especially among those named on the Canary Mission site. Rachel Weber, a Jewish attorney and professor at UMass Amherst, is one of them.</p>
<p>"It partakes in the false conflation of criticism — any criticism — of the State of Israel, which is a political entity, with antisemitism," Weber said.</p>
<p>Weber, who was involved in pro-Palestinian campus protests, said she has received death threats after being listed on the site.</p>
<p>"It invites this internal repression, this internal spying on each other, which then literally is actually being used by the federal government for state repression," she said.</p>
<p>Canary Mission denies any coordination with the U.S. government.</p>
<p>"We have had no contact with either this administration or the previous administration," the group said in a statement. "We document individuals and groups that promote hatred of the USA, Israel and Jews. We investigate hatred across the political spectrum."</p>
<p>The site's homepage claims its mission is to ensure that "today's radicals do not become tomorrow's employees."</p>
<p>Rabbi Mendy Uminer from Chestnut Hill believes in the importance of calling out hate, but also urges toning down the rhetoric.</p>
<p>"We should encourage free speech. We should encourage activism in ways that don't hurt, in ways that don't intimidate," he said.</p>
<p>Uminer said he wouldn't condemn someone trying to defend the Jewish community, but cautioned, "Sometimes websites are wrong. Sometimes people are wrong. And we should double-check things and make sure it's true."</p>
<p>Ozturk and other student activists who were detained by ICE were <a data-id="https://www.nbcboston.com/news/local/bail-hearing-tufts-student-rumeysa-ozturk-detained-in-louisiana/3708999/" data-type="link" href="https://www.nbcboston.com/news/local/bail-hearing-tufts-student-rumeysa-ozturk-detained-in-louisiana/3708999/">released</a> after judges found their detentions unconstitutional.</p>
<p>The trial seeks to determine whether the Trump administration's efforts to revoke visas of pro-Palestinian protesters based on Canary Mission profiles violates the First Amendment.</p>
