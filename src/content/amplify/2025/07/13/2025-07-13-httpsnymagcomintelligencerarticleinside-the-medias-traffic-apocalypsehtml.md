  News websites are losing readers because Facebook and Google are changing how
  they show news, making it harder to get traffic. Publishers are now focusing
  on building direct relationships with loyal readers through apps, newsletters,
  and subscriptions. They also try new ideas and original reporting to stand out
  in a world where AI can replace many simple stories.

title: Inside the Media’s Traffic Apocalypse

<p>Last spring, the entertainment and lifestyle website Bustle saw huge spikes in traffic for a handful of stories — between 150,000 and 300,000 concurrent search views each, compared to the usual 1,000 or less. Bustle had long struggled to place high in SEO rankings or land on the Google News module, but recent months had been particularly brutal, and the spikes prompted emergency meetings to figure out how to keep them going. “Bryan Goldberg made it a top priority of the company to see if they could duplicate that success,” said a former staffer, referring to Bustle’s CEO. Goldberg made a few new hires and even pulled people from other teams to create a new team that would help crank out similar content.</p>
<p>But the traffic bonanza turned out to be a mirage. The new team was laid off two months later.</p>
<p>Bustle’s desperate quest for traffic is an extreme version of the media’s attempts to boost readership in what news publishers are calling the post-Google era. “When a one-off article performed well, we’d zero in on that conceit and write ten more articles on it,” said one former staffer at Business Insider. “And despite that, nothing was hitting.” In May, CEO Barbara Peng <a href="https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/business-insider-layoffs-shift-toward-ai-live-events-1236412950/">announced</a> that Business Insider would lay off 21 percent of staffers, citing the need to “endure extreme traffic drops outside of our control.”</p>
<p>Traffic headwinds are not exactly a new problem for media companies, but it has only gotten worse. The problem started with Facebook pivoting away from the news in 2022, and has accelerated in recent months as Google makes seemingly corrosive changes to its search algorithm while rolling out the innovation that will one day replace traditional search results: <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/google-ai-news-publishers-7e687141?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=ASWzDAiiA_N4Wa9nLJLxpJkaA8Hslz6amcauD1BUDE3tYuuysVwITfMct4d0jizQ2LI%3D&amp;gaa_ts=68668ca9&amp;gaa_sig=oRrAskRAlIzzNjrTskapgO07Q9DyDlEPmp1Ou0xsSkn-thAJEixKk4V_z6Q43i83o0lTx6DJ6MF6WRVRqHhl-w%3D%3D">AI summaries</a>. “Search engines now deliver answers instead of links, while social platforms aim to keep users within their walled gardens,” a senior <em>New Yorker</em> editor explained. The social media platform formerly known as Twitter, once a modest traffic generator that nevertheless functioned as a network for journalists and media organizations to share their stories and seed wider dissemination, has become virtually useless for media companies since owner <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/hurricane-milton-elon-musk-x-twitter-useless-news-emergency.html">Elon Musk</a> throttled news links. “We don’t get shit from Twitter anymore,” said Tom Ley, editor-in-chief and co-founder of Defector. “You tweet out a link to an article and it just disappears.”</p>
<p>It all amounts to a kind of <a href="https://pressgazette.co.uk/media-audience-and-business-data/media_metrics/most-popular-websites-news-us-monthly-3/?utm_source=www.status.news&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=60-minutes-draws-the-line&amp;_bhlid=f4c71c8112bbdb9f1e2c6c887168a450474e55fc">traffic apocalypse</a> in which it seems all spigots for traffic are being turned off, affecting news organizations big and small, new and old. It hurts outlets heavily reliant on digital advertising, but also those that draw revenue from product recommendations and subscriptions. The whole premise of internet publishing — that you could reach audiences far and wide — is starting to crumble, forcing publishers to reevaluate what kind of stories they produce and what kind of readers they want — and, ultimately, to think smaller and more bespoke. “The good news for any digital publisher is that the new game we all have to play is also a sustainable one: You have to build a direct relationship with your core readers,” said <em>GQ </em>global editorial director Will Welch. “We talk pretty much every day about the idea of ‘Google Zero.’ Honestly I love the drama of that term — it gives you a jolt. Time to take action.”</p>
<p>Not everyone is so excited. “I’ve never seen so much disarray in a strategic capacity in terms of where we’re all pointing the boat. No one is in alignment,” said one top magazine editor. “Right now you’re seeing literally every strategy going to market.” If there is consensus, it’s around having a diversified strategy that avoids being reliant on any third-party platform to reach an audience. But “that’s hard to do if you’re a startup brand and don’t have 20 years of consumer memory of who you are,” said Keith Bonnici, who became COO of <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/joanna-coles-daily-beast-takeover.html">The Daily Beast</a> last fall.</p>
<p>It’s even a challenge for the legacy organizations with the most recognizable brands. “Frankly, some of the stuff that we’re doing right now — and we have been doing over the last year or so — around establishing a direct relationship, about building in tools that help our journalism reach more people without relying on platforms — we should have been doing years ago,” said a senior New York <em>Times</em> editor. “But it was sort of like we weren’t forced to really contend with it.”</p>
<p>Subscription-based publications are undoubtedly in a better position to weather this moment. “Outlets that really relied on a much more casual news reader who just sort of popped in and out, maybe because they saw something in their Facebook feed or on X or whatever — those are the outlets that might feel it much more acutely,” said the <em>Times</em> editor. Still, “for us to grow, we need to introduce ourselves to people who are interested in news,” they said, which is why search remains a “critical channel” for the <em>Times</em>. “What better way to introduce ourselves to those people than showing up when they’re searching for news? It’s why if we’re late to a story, that’s quite bad because it means they’ve chosen someone else when they were looking for it.”</p>
<p>“Our audience is already relatively small and engaged, so we haven’t had a problem keeping people who are interested in the site coming to it,” said Ley, who noted Defector has about 40,000 paying subscribers, around 90 percent of whom go directly to the homepage. “I do think we are running into an issue of just finding new people who have never heard of us before, and that’s usually where Twitter and Google search are really helpful.”</p>
<p>Outlets are deploying various strategies to maintain a direct connection with readers. Having a good app has become paramount, and there’s a premium on squeezing more juice out of newsletter lists. Defector, for example, is making a more aggressive outreach to the list of nearly 250,000 people who’ve registered with their email. Email targets readers based on their interests and behavior and encourages them to either stay subscribed or make the jump to subscribe if they haven’t already. It also helps build a daily habit in readers’ inboxes, which is preferable to publishers that otherwise have to resort to finding readers on platforms they can’t control. Many columnists today have associated newsletters, including the entire slate at <em>GQ</em>. “AI is going to render a lot of types of stories redundant, but it can’t compete with a great columnist who has a strong voice and a loyal following of people who want to hear directly from their favorite writer,” said Welch.</p>
<p>“As our subscriber base grows, our subscribers just consume a lot more,” said the <em>Times</em> editor. “It’s cheaper to keep a customer than attract a new customer,” added the magazine editor, who noted that organizing your outlet around the most loyal readers can also help in the advertising department. “Advertisers want to put their money in areas that already have paying customers, because that means there’s a path to purchase through you,” they said. “It’s creating these islands of success in an ocean of instability. It does feel different inside a place that built a higher wall earlier.”</p>
<p>Even email is vulnerable, though. “We’re now starting to face some challenges with email that are similar to search challenges because Google is essentially bringing AI to the inbox,” said an executive at a product-recommendation site, who has noticed a reduction in click-through rates on email, but not reductions in open rates; this, they believe, is because Google is summarizing emails and the summaries are being recorded as opens, even though people aren’t actually reading the emails.</p>
<p>The Washington<em> Post </em>has been at the forefront of experimental efforts to attract new readers and keep them engaged. CEO and Publisher Will Lewis told me that the <em>Post</em> is “not immune” to the traffic slowdown and has been developing new features in an effort to “increase engagement on our platforms, and reduce our dependency on search.” The <em>Post</em> recently announced From the Source, a program inviting sources quoted in their articles to elaborate further on the website after a story is published. The idea, said Lewis, is to facilitate “more direct audience connection as we continue the conversation about our journalism on our own platforms, rather than losing those interactions to social media.” The <em>Post</em> has also launched a program called Ripple to invite nonprofessional writers to publish columns in the Opinion section.</p>
<p>Those projects have received a lukewarm reception. The <em>Times</em>’s Edmund Lee has <a href="https://x.com/edmundlee/status/1940063370427740347">noted</a> that From the Source could be abused if sources use the <em>Post</em>’s platform to push their own agenda or interests. And Ripple has been widely compared to the junky user-generated essays that proliferated on Forbes and HuffPost.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/media/google-search-change-product-recommendation-websites-02394b79?mod=article_inline">Product-review</a> sites, an important revenue-generation component for sites ranging from the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/"><em>Times</em></a> to <a href="https://nymag.com/strategist/"><em>New York</em></a>, are particularly vulnerable to Google’s evolving AI tools. AI Overviews has not started recommending products yet — Google seems to be treading lightly here, ostensibly because it does not want to step on its own business of getting money from advertisers — but that doesn’t mean it’s not coming. “People who say they’re fine — they’re full of shit. It’s like, ok, you’re fine now. But you could get punched in the face tomorrow,” said the product-recommendation executive. “If Google Search drops 20 percent for us next week, it’s going to be tough. For product recommendation sites, my rule of thumb in terms of the value of the reader is: one search reader is the equivalent of two email readers and three homepage readers. Because one search reader is an incredibly intentional reader.” The prospect of losing search traffic for product reviews is especially worrisome because “it’s the most valuable traffic: it’s people who want to buy stuff. And the question is how do you replace that.”</p>
<p>Wirecutter’s deputy publisher Cliff Levy recently told all 250 staffers to take a day off for brainstorming, the mandate being to come up with three ideas about how to either use AI to make journalism better or for Wirecutter to stand out more in an era of AI-produced content. Wirecutter also recently posted a <a href="https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/thenewyorktimes/jobs/4580151005">job</a> for an AI lead.</p>
<p>Evergreen, service-focused journalism — such as “What You Need to Know About Cancer Screening” or “The Best Movies to Stream on Netflix Right Now” — has been hit hard by the switch to AI. “I don’t see the value in evergreen content in a world where people are engaging with AI for responses to their queries, because evergreen content by definition doesn’t change,” said Bonnici. “AI is going to do a much better job of delivering it than any single outlet can because they’re aggregating and coming up with the best response based on a hundred outlets.”</p>
<p>So what’s working? Original reporting can break through the noise and even overcome, at times, the hurdles that social media companies have created. Publishers now place a premium on content that reinforces their voice and sensibility, whether through a punchy essay or coverage of the New York City mayor’s race. “There was a big mental frame shift a few years ago, which was that rivers of traffic don’t necessarily turn into paying subscribers,” said the magazine editor. “And if those paid subscribers are just seeing mountains of undistinguished crap, their churn is high.”</p>
<p>It’s also a matter of meeting readers where they are. Traditionally text-oriented publications have leaned into changing consumption patterns around podcasts and video, without falling into the “pivot to video” traps of old, which gutted, and sometimes even bankrupted, media companies that made videos specifically for Facebook. Welch points to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V53tyvVmQDQ"><em>GQ</em>’s Video Cover story</a> that launched in late 2023 in an effort to bring <em>GQ</em>’s celebrity profiles to a different format. “I don’t think people are going to stop reading high-quality journalism online — but overall people are clearly reading less and watching video more,” said Welch. “The idea is to bring the deep, thoughtful, intimate access people get from <em>GQ</em>’s celebrity profiles but do it in the most popular medium of the day, which is video. It’s been working.”</p>
<p>With some exceptions, the current media environment favors publications with focused offerings that play to their strengths and cater to the most dedicated audience members, which makes things tough for general-interest publications that generically cover culture and lifestyle. “Places that have built a business of inspiring and informing you and telling you how to live your best life are more vulnerable right now, because there are other things telling you how to live your best life, like TikTok and very sophisticated AI search engines,” said a magazine editor. “Places that have ‘if you pay us we will give you news no one has’ propositions are in a better position — even Puck, which says if you pay us we will give you possibly un-fact-checked things that no one else has.”</p>
<p>“The thing people click on are exclusives and anything that has a distinct voice or a really strong opinion,” said a Hearst staffer. “What do you have that can’t be delivered by Pop Crave? That, I think, is everyone’s question.”</p>
