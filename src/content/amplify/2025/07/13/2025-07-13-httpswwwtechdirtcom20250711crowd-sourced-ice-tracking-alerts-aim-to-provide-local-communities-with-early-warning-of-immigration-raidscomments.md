  Crowd-Sourced ICE Tracking Alerts Aim To Provide Local Communities With Early
  Warning Of Immigration Raids

<h3>from the <i>see-something,-tap-something</i> dept</h3>
<p>Techdirt has just written about how people are using Ring doorbell cameras to <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2025/06/30/surveillance-against-the-state-doorbell-cam-owners-are-tipping-people-off-about-ice-raids/">warn</a> others in the area about the presence of ICE agents and the risk of possible ICE raids. That’s a good example of using existing technology to monitor the increasingly widespread and brutal activities of ICE teams. But driven by a desire to counter the US government’s moves, people are also coming up with new systems to warn people about what is happening in their community.</p>
<p>For example, the <a href="https://www.stopice.net/">Stop ICE Raids Alert Network</a> sends and receives warnings about nearby ICE activity using text messages. On its home page, it claims to have over 470,000 subscribers currently. That approach, while effective, might be a little basic for some people, and a number of smartphone apps have been created to meet the need for something more sophisticated. One of them is <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/iceblock/id6741939020">ICEBlock</a>, which came to the notice of a wider public thanks to a <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/06/30/tech/iceblock-app-trump-immigration-crackdown">CNN report on 30 June</a>. Its developer, Joshua Aaron, told CNN that his free app was designed to be an early warning system for users when ICE is operating nearby. Its slogan is “See Something, Tap Something”:</p>
<blockquote> <p><em>Users can add a pin on a map showing where they spotted agents — along with optional notes, like what officers were wearing or what kind of car they were driving. Other users within a five-mile radius will then receive a push alert notifying them of the sighting.</em></p> </blockquote>
<p>Aaron says he does not want users to interfere with ICE’s operations directly, and when a user logs a sighting, the app warns: “Please note that the use of this app is for information and notification purposes only. It is not to be used for the purposes of inciting violence or interfering with law enforcement.” Aaron has also tried to minimize the risk that the platform is flooded with false reports:</p>
<blockquote> <p><em>Although ICEBlock has no surefire way of guaranteeing the accuracy of user reports, Aaron says he’s built safeguards to prevent users from spamming the platform with fake sightings. Users can only report a sighting within five miles of their location, and they can only report once every five minutes. Reports are automatically deleted after four hours.</em></p> </blockquote>
<p>Privacy for users is naturally a key concern:</p>
<blockquote> <p><em>ICEBlock doesn’t collect personal data, and users are completely anonymous, according to Aaron. It’s only available on iOS because Aaron says the app would have to collect information that could ultimately put users at risk to provide the same experience on Android.</em></p> <p><em>Reassuring users of those privacy protections will likely be key to growing ICEBlock’s user base, given how the government is building a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/25/politics/doge-building-master-database-immigration/index.html">database</a> to aid in its deportation efforts.</em></p> </blockquote>
<p>ICEBlock’s user base has already been given a huge boost thanks to the <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/tag/streisand-effect/">Streisand Effect</a>. After the CNN report was broadcast, <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/leavitt-warns-cnn-over-inciting-violence-against-ice-but-says-we-havent-seen-the-clip/ar-AA1HI8hq">White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt was asked about the app</a>. As MSN reported, Leavitt replied:</p>
<blockquote> <p><em>I’ll have to watch the clip myself but surely it sounds like this would be an incitement of further violence against our ICE officers. As you stated, there’s been a 500% increase in violence against ICE agents, law enforcement officers across the country who are just simply trying to do their jobs and remove public safety threats from our communities.</em></p> </blockquote>
<p>Despite her use of a <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2025/07/02/assaults-on-ice-officers-are-up-700-which-just-means-there-have-been-69-more-assaults-than-last-year/">misleading</a> statistic about assaults on ICE officers, Leavitt’s criticism of ICEBlock naturally led many people to investigate it. In fact, soon after her comment, ICEBlock became the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/bengoggin.bsky.social/post/3lswgll3m4k2k">top social networking app in the App Store</a> <em>—</em> ahead of Threads, WhatsApp, Telegram and Facebook <em>—</em> a position it still holds at the time of writing. In the CNN interview, Aaron said his app had more than 20,000 users, but thanks to Leavitt the number is more than ten times that. According to a story on Wired, ICEBlock now has over 240,000 users, and <a data-id="https://www.wired.com/story/trump-officials-want-to-prosecute-over-the-iceblock-app-lawyers-say-thats-unconstitutional/" data-type="link" href="https://www.wired.com/story/trump-officials-want-to-prosecute-over-the-iceblock-app-lawyers-say-thats-unconstitutional/">Trump administration officials have threatened to prosecute</a> Aaron for creating the app, and CNN for reporting on it.</p>
<p>Another app that aims to report and share sightings of ICE activities is <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-hack-latino-empowering-community">Hack Latino</a>. On its GoFundMe page, which is no longer accepting donations, the organizer claims “30,000 app users and 50,000 website visitors”. As someone from Guatemala who uses the Hack Latino app explains in an <a href="https://restofworld.org/2025/immigration-raids-migrant-safety-apps/">article on the Rest of the World site</a>, the app works like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waze">Waze</a>, which provides live traffic updates: “It sends you a message saying there’s a Border Patrol ahead and that you need to turn back. Most migrants are protecting themselves with it.” However, the same article warns that the US government has taken note of the rise of these apps, and is already working to counter them. It quotes Pedro Rios, director of the American Friends Service Committee, a Quaker organization that supports migrants and refugees:</p>
<blockquote> <p><em>The U.S. government, said Rios, is hiring companies that can identify users who post information about raids on these platforms.</em></p> <p><em>“Many of us no longer post all the information,” said Rios. Instead, details on immigration sweeps are “being shared on paper from person to person, or through photos and WhatsApp.”</em></p> </blockquote>
<p>And so the contest between the hunters and the hunted continues.</p>
