<p>A clinic in rural Nebraska has become a political flash point after tying its looming closure to Trump’s law cutting Medicaid.</p>
<p>CURTIS, Nebraska — The only health clinic here is shutting down, and the hospital CEO has blamed Medicaid cuts in President Donald Trump’s signature legislation. But residents of Curtis — a one-stoplight town in deep-red farm country — aren’t buying that explanation.</p>
<p>“Anyone who’s saying that Medicaid cuts is why they’re closing is a liar,” April Roberts said, as she oversaw lunch at the Curtis Area Senior Center.</p>
