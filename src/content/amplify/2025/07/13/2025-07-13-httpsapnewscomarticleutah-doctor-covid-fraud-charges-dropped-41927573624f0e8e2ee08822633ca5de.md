<p>The federal government on Saturday dismissed charges against a Utah plastic surgeon accused of throwing away <a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/covid-vaccination-shots-pregnant-children-rfk-ab93a3dd47e5b2a4b7427f1bc5e0f1b9">COVID-19 vaccines</a>, giving children saline shots instead of the vaccine and selling faked vaccination cards.</p>
<p>U.S. Attorney General <a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/pam-bondi">Pam Bondi</a> said in a post on the social media platform X that charges against Dr. Michael Kirk Moore, of Midvale, Utah, were dismissed at her direction.</p>
<p>Moore and other defendants faced up to 35 years in prison after being charged with conspiracy to defraud the government; conspiracy to convert, sell, convey and dispose of government property; and aiding and abetting in those efforts. The charges were brought when <a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/joe-biden">Joe Biden</a> was president.</p>
<p>“Dr. Moore gave his patients a choice when the federal government refused to do so,” Bondi wrote. “He did not deserve the years in prison he was facing. It ends today.”</p>
<p>Felice John Viti, acting U.S. attorney for Utah, filed the motion Saturday, saying “such dismissal is in the interests of justice.”</p>
<p>The trial began Monday in Salt Lake City with jury selection. It was expected to last 15 days.</p>
<p>Messages sent to the U.S. Department of Justice, Viti’s office in Salt Lake City and to Moore were not immediately returned Saturday to The Associated Press.</p>
<p>A federal grand jury on Jan. 11, 2023, returned an indictment against Moore, his Plastic Surgery Institute of Utah Inc., others associated with the clinic and a neighbor of Moore’s. The indictment alleged more than $28,000 of government-provided COVID-19 vaccine doses were destroyed.</p>
<p>They were also accused of providing fraudulently completed vaccination record cards for over 1,900 doses of the vaccine in exchange for either a cash or a donation to a specified charitable organization.</p>
<p>The government also alleged some children were given saline shots, at their parents’ request, so the minors believed they were getting the vaccine.</p>
<p>Health Secretary <a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/robert-f-kennedy-jr">Robert Kennedy Jr.,</a> a leading anti-vaccine activist before becoming the nation’s top health official, posted his support for Moore in April, saying on X that Moore “deserves a medal for his courage and his commitment to healing!”</p>
<p>During his confirmation hearings in January, Kennedy repeatedly refused to <a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/rfk-jr-vaccine-trump-science-autism-9b99621b01f11b7f0bdc81e5a0b82d2b">acknowledge scientific consensus</a> that <a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/vaccinations-kindergarten-exemptions-cdc-1c0f9a196a70491fccf48b9125090de0">childhood vaccines</a> don’t cause autism and that <a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/lawsuit-vaccines-kennedy-95a1aa23c3f015f7a35a570f5ef8da36">COVID-19 vaccines</a> saved millions of lives.</p>
<p>In a follow-up X post on Saturday, Bondi said Georgia Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene brought the case to her attention.</p>
