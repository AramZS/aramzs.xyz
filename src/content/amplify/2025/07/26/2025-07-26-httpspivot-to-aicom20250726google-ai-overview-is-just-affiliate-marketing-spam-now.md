title: Google AI Overview is just affiliate marketing spam now

<p>What’s the real purpose of Google’s AI Overview? It’s affiliate marketing spam! That’s what it’s for.</p>
<p>Pivot readers know how to get around the AI overview. You click on the “web” tab, you use the udm14 hack or a browser extension, you just use a different search engine.</p>
<p>But these are all individual responses — and this is a systemic problem. The default is AI Overview, and approximately nobody works around them.</p>
<p>So why can’t you find proper reviews of anything in Google? Because search engine optimisation has flooded all the top slots with cheap clickbait for affiliate marketing, mostly generated by a chatbot, and not with honest reviews.</p>
<p>Our heroes for today are housefresh.com, a site that does nothing but reviews of air filters. HouseFresh got sick of being ignored in favour of SEO slop, and then even more ignored by the AI slop that the Overview generated from the SEO slop.</p>
<p>So HouseFresh did a bit of detailed journalism about how the AI Overview recommends products: “Beware of the Google AI salesman and its cronies.” [<a href="https://housefresh.com/beware-of-the-google-ai-salesman/"><i>HouseFresh</i></a>]</p>
<p>The AI Overview is either made-up slop or a slightly-wrong summary of an actual source that Google cribbed from. But the product reviews are unusually bad.</p>
<p>The Overview prefers to use the <i>worst</i> sources. It keeps using press releases, product listings and sponsored reviews — that is, information straight from the manufacturer.</p>
<p>The sources at the side of the AI Overview — which<a href="https://pivot-to-ai.com/2025/07/24/nobody-clicks-past-googles-ai-overviews/"> 99% of searchers never check</a> — are fake too. HouseFresh found that 19.5% of the claimed sources didn’t even mention the product.</p>
<p>HouseFresh even got the AI Overview to spit out the standard template it seems to use for its product reviews:</p>
<blockquote><p>The [Model] air purifier is [a worthwhile investment]/[generally considered a good value for its price]/[a worthwhile purchase]. It’s [praised]/[well-regarded] for its ability to [clean the air]/[remove particles]/[clean large rooms]. Whether the [Model] is worth it depends on individual needs and priorities.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you ask Google about a product that <i>doesn’t exist</i>, it’ll confidently reply with a template like this telling you what a great buy the nonexistent gadget is.</p>
<p>Google tries really hard never to say negative things about a product, including machines that are famous for how bad they are. If you ask for a list of cons about a product, it’ll start hallucinating those too.</p>
<p>Finally, Google puts sponsored product listings above the AI Overview , because Google is about the ads. The purpose of the AI Overview is to point you at the paid advertisements. It’s affiliate marketing with one layer of indirection.</p>
<p>The other favourite source for AI Overviews is Reddit. There’s a lot of humans with genuine opinions on Reddit. But HouseFresh found entirely spam subreddits, all posts promotional and written by chatbots. No human ever goes there. The purpose is for Google to see the spam, think “oh it’s on Reddit” and feed it to the search index and the AI overviews.</p>
<p>Bloomberg asked Google CEO Sundar Pichal about the lack of separation between search and advertising, and he said: “commercial information is information, too.” Yeah thanks, Sundar. [<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-03-24/google-s-ai-search-overhaul-racing-chatgpt-for-the-web-s-future"><i>Bloomberg</i></a>]</p>
<p>Google had a good earnings report for second quarter, so Pichal’s done his actual job. And that means there are no brakes on the AI spam train. [<a href="https://abc.xyz/assets/cc/27/3ada14014efbadd7a58472f1f3f4/2025q2-alphabet-earnings-release.pdf"><i>Alphabet</i></a><i>, PDF</i>]</p>
