<p>Fifteen years ago, when Arizona enacted a notorious anti-immigrant “show me your papers” law, I wrote an <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/26/breathing-while-undocumented/?searchResultPosition=1">essay</a> in The Times that began: “I’m glad I’ve already seen the Grand Canyon. Because I’m not going back to Arizona as long as it remains a police state, which is what the appalling anti-immigrant bill that Gov. Jan Brewer signed into law last week has turned it into.”</p>
<p>The essay provoked a variety of reactions, most supportive but some vituperatively negative. One angry reader, noting that the newspaper identified me as teaching at Yale Law School, wrote to the school’s dean to demand that he fire me. The dean and I had a good laugh over that letter. But rather than dismiss it as the product of an eccentric crank, I realize now that I should have understood the letter as a window on the toxic brew of anti-immigrant sentiment that led a state to pass such a law.</p>
<p>The Obama administration challenged Arizona’s law, and after the Supreme Court <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/567/387/#tab-opinion-1970514">invalidated</a> most of it in 2012, the harsh anti-immigrant wave subsided. But now my letter writer and like-minded people have a friend in the White House. Or friends, actually — among them, Stephen Miller, the deputy chief of staff, who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/07/opinion/stephen-miller.html?searchResultPosition=1&amp;login=smartlock&amp;auth=login-smartlock">appears to be</a> giving President Trump his marching orders for the arrests and deportations now shredding the civic fabric of communities across the country.</p>
<p>I have a home in the Los Angeles area, and my recent weeks there encompassed the deployment of the Marines and the federalization of California’s National Guard. I steeled myself every morning to read the granular reporting in The Los Angeles Times of scenes that I could never have imagined just months ago: <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-06-19/elected-officials-outraged-immigration-raid-pasadena-bus-stop">people snatched up</a> while waiting at a bus stop in peaceful Pasadena; the undocumented <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-06-22/father-of-3-marines-violently-detained-federal-agents">father of three Marines</a> taken at his landscaping job, pinned down and punched by masked federal agents before being thrown into detention. People whose quiet presence among us was tolerated for decades as they paid their taxes and raised their American children are now hunted down like animals, so fearful of even going grocery shopping that Los Angeles nonprofits have <a href="https://www.latimes.com/food/story/2025-06-21/la-restaurants-nonprofits-deliver-groceries-to-immigrants-at-home">mobilized</a> to deliver food to their doors.</p>
<p>I was taking an early morning walk in my neighborhood when a black S.U.V. with tinted windows slowed to a stop a half block ahead. I considered: If this is ICE coming to take someone, should I intervene? Start filming? Make sure the victims know their rights? Or just keep walking, secure in the knowledge that no one was coming for me? The car turned out to be an airport limo picking up a passenger, and I was left to ponder how bizarre it was to feel obliged to run through such a mental triage on a summer morning on an American city street.</p>
<p>Something beyond the raw politics of immigration lies behind the venomous cruelty on display, and I think it is this: To everyone involved, from the policymakers in Washington to the masked agents on the street, undocumented individuals are “the other” — people who not only lack legal rights as a formal matter but who stand outside the web of connection that defines human society. Tom Homan, the Trump administration’s border czar, refers to undocumented immigrants as “<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6374707951112">the gotaways</a>,” the ones we didn’t catch.</p>
<p>In a lecture at Loyola University Chicago in April, Bishop Mark J. Seitz of El Paso observed that the current immigration crisis “is driven by the deeper crisis of public and social life.” He continued: “On a fundamental level, these are signs that we are losing the story of who we are as a country. This is a crisis of narrative. Are we no longer a country of immigrants? Are we no longer a country that values the dignity of the human person, individual liberties and with a healthy regard for checks and balances?”</p>
<p>An adaptation of Bishop Seitz’s powerful lecture was <a href="https://www.commonwealmagazine.org/living-vein-compassion">published by</a> the Catholic magazine Commonweal, which is where I read it. (Another bishop, Alberto Rojas of San Bernardino, Calif., 60 miles east of Los Angeles, took <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/10/us/california-san-bernardino-bishop-mass-church-ice-raids.html#:~:text=Bishop%20Alberto%20Rojas%20of%20the,fear%20of%20immigration%20enforcement%20actions.%E2%80%9D&amp;text=The%20Diocese%20of%20San%20Bernardino%20has%20told%20its%20parishioners%20that,fear%20of%20federal%20immigration%20raids">the rare step</a> of telling the 1.6 million worshipers in the diocese by letter last week that they were excused from attending Mass if they were afraid of immigration enforcement if they came to church.) The Catholic Church has distinguished itself by the moral clarity of its critique of the president’s deportation obsession.</p>
<p>I wish I saw the same powerful advocacy from major Jewish organizations, which I’d argue have a particular responsibility and interest in addressing this issue. Aren’t antisemitism and anti-immigrant cruelty two sides of the same coin? Both spring from viewing members of a group as “the other.” The focus of these organizations, naturally enough, is antisemitism, and the Trump administration’s exploitation of the real problem of antisemitism for its own purposes seems to have thrown some of them off-kilter.</p>
<p>I’ve been wondering when the moment will come when ICE will go far enough to persuade more people outside Los Angeles that it must be reined in. Maybe it will look something like the military invasion of the city’s MacArthur Park the other day, when soldiers and federal agents on horseback and in armored vehicles swept in for no obvious purpose other than to sow terror. “It’s the way a city looks before a coup,” Mayor Karen Bass, who rushed to the park, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/07/us/la-macarthur-park-immigration.html">said</a> later.</p>
<p>Can New Yorkers envision such a scene in Central Park? Is anywhere safe now for someone who can’t show the right papers?</p>
<p>People of a certain age might remember the songwriter Jimmy Webb’s weirdly compelling “<a href="https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/richardharris/macarthurpark.html">MacArthur Park</a>,” with its refrain that begins: “MacArthur’s Park is melting in the dark.” Growing up in the East, I had never heard of MacArthur Park when the song hit the charts in 1968, and I wasn’t sure it was a real place. All these years later, something real is melting for sure. It is the glue that holds civil society together.</p>
