  In the U.S., as nowhere else, health insurance and employment are deeply
  connected. And that means confusion can snare even elite athletes.

<p>What drove Venus Williams to the court at the <a href="https://www.mubadalacitidcopen.com/en">Mubadala Citi DC Open</a> this week after a year-long break from competition?</p>
<p>"I had to come back for the insurance," she quipped in an <a href="https://youtu.be/PSAeEa0K2Rw?si=yg9k00I2pVlyv2dw&amp;t=247">on-court interview</a> after winning her first-round match on Tuesday. "I was like, 'I got to get my benefits on!' Started training."</p>
<p>The crowd at the stadium in D.C. laughed knowingly. "You guys know what it's like!" she said.</p>

<p>Even if you're not a seven-time grand slam champion who just became the oldest player to win a pro women's singles match in decades, you probably know the job-health insurance juggle that Williams was talking about.</p>
<p>Here are four ways U.S. health insurance can be challenging for Williams and many other Americans.</p>
<h3><strong>1. Her job is a little off and on.</strong></h3>
<p>In the U.S., most working-age people get their <a href="https://www.kff.org/health-policy-101-employer-sponsored-health-insurance/?entry=table-of-contents-introduction">health insurance through work</a>. Their employer gives them a few plan options and then pays a healthy chunk of the premium cost, with the rest deducted from employees' paychecks.</p>
<p>When someone leaves a regular job maybe to start a business or take a break, there goes that health insurance deal. That's essentially what happened to Williams — she took a break from competition and lost access to her regular benefits.</p>
<p>The health insurance Venus Williams got through the Women's Tennis Association was a "best-in-class global medical, dental and vision insurance plan," WTA wrote in a statement to NPR. In order to be eligible, players have to have a certain ranking and play a certain number of events in the previous year, according to the statement, and coverage lasts for the full calendar year.</p>
<p>"They informed me earlier this year I'm on COBRA," Williams explained on the court Tuesday. COBRA is a law that allows you to keep your job-based insurance plan after your job ends, but you have to pay for the whole premium yourself.</p>
<p>"With COBRA, you may have a very good plan, but your health care costs are going to go up," explains <a href="https://www.mirandayaver.com/">Miranda Yaver</a>, health policy professor at the University of Pittsburgh. It's notoriously expensive, often $500 per month or more. COBRA to cover a whole family's insurance premium can easily rival a mortgage payment.</p>
<p>Venus Williams is a multi-millionaire, so the premium cost might not matter to her in the same way it does to the average person, especially if it allows her to keep that "best-in-class" plan she's used to.</p>
<h3>2. She has health care needs.</h3>
<p>"Let me tell you, I'm always at the doctor, so I need this insurance," Williams said in her courtside interview.</p>
<p>Williams <a href="https://nyulangone.org/news/venus-williams-shares-her-journey-uterine-fibroids-advocates-womens-health">recently explained</a> she <a href="https://www.today.com/health/womens-health/venus-williams-fibroids-rcna216504">had surgery</a> for uterine fibroids that had gone undertreated for years, she said. She also was <a href="https://sjogrens.org/blog/2022/venus-williams-stands-up-for-sjogrens-awareness">diagnosed</a> with an auto-immune condition called <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sjogrens-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20353216#:~:text=Age.,blurred%20vision%20and%20corneal%20damage.">Sjogren's syndrome</a> in 2011.</p>
<p>She's also an elite athlete. "Someone in her position might need physical therapy, sports, medicine, specialized care, and to be able to get that anywhere in the world," says <a href="https://www.kff.org/person/cynthia-cox/">Cynthia Cox</a>, a vice president at the health research organization KFF.</p>
<p>Plus, Williams is now 45 years old. Health insurance costs generally increase with age, as do health problems.</p>
<p>All of that could make finding a health plan that works for her more complicated than for most people.</p>
<h3>3. She has way more options than she used to.</h3>
<p>Before the Affordable Care Act, Venus Williams would have really been in a tough spot.</p>
<p>Professional athletes were included on a <a href="https://www.kff.org/affordable-care-act/issue-brief/pre-existing-conditions-and-medical-underwriting-in-the-individual-insurance-market-prior-to-the-aca/">list of "Ineligible Occupations"</a> — jobs that health insurance companies deemed too risky to provide coverage for — along with loggers, miners and taxi cab drivers.</p>
<p>Also back then, "even a wealthy person might have had preexisting conditions that could have made them uninsurable no matter how much money they were willing to pay for their premium," Cox says.</p>
<p>That contributed to "job lock" — where people were stuck in their jobs no matter what because they needed the health insurance.</p>
<p>Now, if Williams really didn't want to compete anymore and ran out of her 18-months of COBRA coverage, she could go to <a href="http://healthcare.gov">Healthcare.gov</a> and buy an Affordable Care Act plan.</p>
<h3>4. Only in the U.S., jobs and health insurance are deeply linked.</h3>
<p>There's no escaping the fact that in America, health insurance is connected to employment. "The dominant insurance model in the United States is employer-sponsored insurance," Yaver says. (The <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/09/28/917747287/the-everlasting-problem">story of how that came to be</a> is related to the post-World War II economy when health insurance was a "fringe benefit," to attract employees in a tight labor market.) Yaver adds that for workers who get insurance from their jobs, it's often "a good deal."</p>
<p>Since Congress passed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the public insurance plan for low-income people, Medicaid, will soon be tied to work, too. Beneficiaries will have to periodically prove they're working a certain number of hours per month to be able to keep their health benefits. That requirement will affect mostly middle-aged, low-income women, according to a <a href="https://www.milbank.org/quarterly/opinions/whos-affected-by-medicaid-work-requirements-its-not-who-you-think/">recent analysis</a>.</p>
<p>For Venus Williams, the off-and-on nature of her job that comes with a high risk of injuries makes employer-based health insurance especially hard. In a way, the tennis hall-of-famer is dealing with a very special version of "job lock."</p>
<p>Her fans can celebrate, though. Even if it's for the health insurance, they get to see her on the court again; she's playing a tournament next month in Cincinnati.</p>
