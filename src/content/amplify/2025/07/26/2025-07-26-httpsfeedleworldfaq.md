<p>The answers below should help people new to feedle and RSS feeds reply to some commonly asked questions. If you have a question you donâ€™t see answered here, please, do not hesitate to <a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/?view=cm&amp;fs=1&amp;tf=1&amp;to=team@feedle.world&amp;su=feedle&amp;body=Hello%2C%0D%0A%0D%0A">contact</a> us.</p>
<h2>What is an RSS feed?</h2>
<p>An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS">RSS feed</a> is a web-based syndication format that allows users to subscribe to a website's content. RSS feeds are commonly used to syndicate content from blogs, news websites, and podcasts. By subscribing to an RSS feed, users can see when new content is published without visiting the website. For example, when a blog author publishes a new blog post, their RSS feed will update to include the latest content, and subscribers will see the update in their feed reader.</p>
<h2>Why is RSS better than social media?</h2>
<p>There are several reasons why RSS is better than social media:</p>
<ul> <li> RSS is more efficient. When you subscribe to an RSS feed, you get the content you're interested in delivered directly to you, rather than having to wade through a bunch of other stuff you don't care about. </li> <li> RSS is more reliable. Social media platforms are constantly changing their algorithms, which can result in missing out on content you care about. With RSS, you know you'll always get the content you're subscribed to. </li> <li> RSS is more private. With social media, your data is constantly being collected and shared with third-party advertisers. RSS doesn't have that issue, as you only get content from the website you're subscribed to. </li> </ul>
<p>RSS is a great way to keep up with your favorite websites without visiting each one individually. In addition, it is perfect for avoiding social media clutter and noise.</p>
<h2>What do I use to subscribe to RSS feeds?</h2>
<p>There are a number of RSS feed readers available, both as web-based services and as downloadable software. Some popular RSS feed readers include:</p>
<p>and many more.</p>
<h2>How do I discover interesting RSS feeds?</h2>
<p>This is where <a href="https://feedle.world">feedle</a> comes in handy. On the one hand, it allows you to search across our database of millions of blog posts and podcast episodes. For every RSS feed we index, we make the content searchable, so people can find precisely the posts and episodes they are interested in. On top of that, every search in feedle has its dedicated RSS feed. We want to lessen the burden of subscribing to hundreds of RSS feeds only to get a few items that are actually interesting to you. With feedle, you subscribe to a single RSS feed that brings in content from multiple sources matching your interests.</p>

<p>This has a nice side effect for content creators too. First, their content can become available to a large, otherwise potentially unaware audience. Second, since every feed item on feedle explicitly links to its origin, we hope readers and listeners will eventually decide to subscribe to authors directly.</p>
