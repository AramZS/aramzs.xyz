  Law enforcement's response to fatal shooting of state lawmakers raises
  questions
---
<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement">Law enforcement’s response</a> to the June 14 shooting of two Minnesota lawmakers and their spouses is raising new questions. The Minnesota Star Tribune (MST) examined the timeline of events and found several instances in which law enforcement made unsettling decisions.</p>
<p>On June 14, state Sen. John Hoffman, 34, DFL, and Rep. Melissa Hortman, DFL, along with their spouses, were shot in their respective homes. Hoffman and his wife were wounded, but survived, while Hortman and her husband were killed.</p>

<p>Despite knowing that a suspect — later identified as Vance Boelter — was impersonating an officer and had targeted a politician, law enforcement took 10 hours to alert lawmakers to the potential danger, <a href="https://www.startribune.com/new-details-from-crucial-hours-after-lawmaker-shootings-raise-questions-about-police-response/601432709">according to MST</a>.</p>
<p>Following the shooting that wounded Hoffman and his wife, a New Hope police officer who was self-dispatched to the home of state Sen. Ann Rest, DFL, allegedly came in contact with Boelter. According to MST, Boelter did not respond to requests from the officer, who then drove away to check on Rest. However, the officer’s interaction with the suspect was not immediately reported, according to MST.</p>

<p>Additionally, the outlet alleges that Brooklyn Park police encountered the gunman at the Hortmans’ home and saw him shoot Mark Hortman in the doorway before firing at the suspect. The gunman then went inside the home and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/crime">additional gunfire</a> was seen inside the house, according to MST.</p>
<p>MST also claims that some police officers and legislators were not fully aware of the threat for several hours.</p>
<p>Boelter was indicted on six federal charges in connection with the shootings, including the attempted shooting of Hope Hoffman. The maximum penalties for the charges include life in prison or death, according to the DOJ.</p>

<p>"Vance Boelter planned and carried out a night of terror that shook Minnesota to its core," Acting U.S. Attorney Joseph H. Thompson said <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-mn/pr/vance-boelter-indicted-murders-melissa-and-mark-hortman-shootings-john-and-yvette-0">in a statement</a>.</p>
<p>"He carried out targeted political assassinations the likes of which have never been seen <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/midwest/minnesota">in Minnesota</a>. We grieve with the Hortman family and continue to pray for the recovery of the Hoffmans. Today, a grand jury indicted Boelter with the most serious of federal charges for these heinous political assassinations. Let me be clear: Boelter will see justice."</p>
<p>Fox News Digital reached out to Brooklyn Park Police and New Hope Police outside of office hours and did not receive a response from either department in time for publication.</p>
