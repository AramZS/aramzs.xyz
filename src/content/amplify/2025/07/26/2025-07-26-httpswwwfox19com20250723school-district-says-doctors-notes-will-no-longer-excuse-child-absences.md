<p>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (<a href="https://www.wsmv.com/2025/07/22/doctors-note-no-longer-excuse-absences-tn-school-district/">WSMV</a>/Gray News) – A school district in Tennessee said doctor’s notes will no longer excuse a child’s absence.</p>
<p>The Lawrence County School System said the policy is aimed at improving the district’s attendance rate, but many parents are against it.</p>
<p>EN ESPAÑOL | <a href="https://www.telemundonashville.com/2025/07/23/distrito-escolar-en-tennessee-no-aceptar-ms-justificantes-mdicos/">Distrito escolar no aceptará más notas médicas para justificar ausencia de estudiantes</a></p>
<p>One parent, Rebecca Sanchez, disagrees with the new policy. She said her 10-year-old daughter got sick a lot last year.</p>
<p>“Between the strep throat and the flu, I can say she missed about 17 days,” Sanchez said.</p>
<p>If her daughter is absent for even half of that time this coming school year, it will now result in a referral to Lawrence County Juvenile Court for truancy.</p>
<p>“I have never been for or against homeschool, but because of this new policy, it has definitely changed my mind,” Sanchez said.</p>
<p>Under the Lawrence County School System’s <a href="https://www.lcss.us/_files/ugd/105297_b76c459f607143858faffd57285ee540.pdf">new attendance policy</a>, doctor’s notes will no longer excuse an absence. Students will now just be marked absent or present.</p>
<p>The policy states that after just three absences, schools will start intervention. If the student misses school for eight or more days, they will be referred to juvenile court.</p>
<p>Director of Schools Michael Adkins addressed the issue during the district’s June school board meeting.</p>
<p>“You can fail the grade,” Adkins said. “You can fail the course. You are going to be petitioned to court. You are not going to participate in graduation, get your driver’s license or permit.”</p>
<p>Adkins also said during the meeting, “We are going to take control of the attendance of our students. You can bring all the doctor’s notes you want, but it is still unexcused.”</p>
<p>While there will be exemptions for verified chronic illnesses and several other things, Adkins and other district officials said during the meeting that students need to learn reliability and work ethic.</p>
<p>“If you have the sniffles, that is fine,” Adkins said during the meeting. “You are going to have them when you go to work one day. We have all gone to work sick and hurt and beat up.”</p>
<p>The district sent a letter last week to local medical providers asking them to “emphasize the importance of regular school attendance while treating school-aged patients.” The letter went on to say that “medical notes excusing students for two or more days can unintentionally imply the students should remain home even after their health improves.”</p>
<p>If a child goes to school sick and the school nurse sends that child home, Adkins said that will be marked as tardy.</p>
<p>“How does that make sense?” Sanchez asked. “As a parent, how can we give someone else the right to say what is wrong with our child?”</p>
<p>Sanchez said she is bracing for the new school year that is now less than two weeks away.</p>
<p>“Ultimately, I am going to do what is right for my kid regardless of this policy,” Sanchez said.</p>
<p>Lawrence County Schools said the new policy is to address the chronic absenteeism the district has. The state tracks absences for any reason, including those that are excused.</p>
<p>The most recent state data for the 2023-2024 school year showed that about 14% of all Lawrence County School System’s students had chronic absenteeism, meaning they missed 10% or more of instructional days.</p>
