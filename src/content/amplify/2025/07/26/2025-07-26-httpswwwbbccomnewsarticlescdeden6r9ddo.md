<p>On Saturday, two state lawmakers from Minnesota were attacked in their homes in what Governor Tim Walz called a "politically motivated assassination" attempt. The attacks left one politician dead and another seriously injured.</p>
<p>Police are hunting for a suspect, Vance Luther Boelter, who remains at large.</p>
<p>The attacks drew condemnation from across the political spectrum. President Donald Trump said in a statement that "such horrific violence will not be tolerated".</p>
<p>US Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat who represents Minnesota, called it "an attack on everything we stand for as a democracy".</p>
<h2>Who were the victims?</h2>
<p>State representative Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, were shot and killed in their home, the governor said.</p>
<p>She had served in the Minnesota House of Representatives for 20 years, and was speaker of the chamber from 2019-25.</p>
<p>State Senator John Hoffman and his wife were shot multiple times and injured, but survived. They had surgery.</p>
<p>Both lawmakers are Democrats.</p>
<h2>What happened?</h2>
<p>So far, local law enforcement has confirmed that the attacks occurred in the early hours of Saturday in the city of Brooklyn Park, Minnesota.</p>
<p>Drew Evans, superintendent of the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, said police received a call at 02:00 local time about an incident at Hoffman's house.</p>
<p>Another call to police came in at 03:35, when officers were checking on Hortman's home.</p>
<p>Police exchanged gunfire with the suspect at Hortman's house in nearby Champlin, but he escaped. A manhunt is underway.</p>
<p>Officials said the attacker was impersonating a police officer, driving a vehicle that resembled a police car and using a badge and uniform.</p>
<h2>Who is the suspect?</h2>
<p>Police said they are looking for a single suspect, 57-year-old Vance Luther Boelter. They did not give details on a possible motive.</p>
<p>A former political appointee, Boelter was once a member of the same state workforce development board as Hoffman.</p>
<p>"We don't know the nature of the relationship or if they actually knew each other," said Mr Evans.</p>
<p>Chief Mark Bruley of the Brooklyn Park Police said authorities found a manifesto and a target list of individuals in the suspect's vehicle.</p>
<p>US Senator Tina Smith of Minnesota, a Democrat, was on the list, a spokesman for her office confirmed to BBC.</p>
<p>Boelter is a security contractor who has worked in Africa and the Middle East, according to an online CV. He has also had managerial roles at firms in Minnesota.</p>
<p>He texted a troubling message to friends at a Minneapolis residence, where he had rented a room and would stay one or two nights a week, <a href="https://www.startribune.com/brooklyn-park-police-searching-for-suspect-in-multiple-targeted-shootings/601372993">the Minnesota Star Tribune reports</a>.</p>
<p>Boelter said: "I'm going to be gone for a while. May be dead shortly, so I just want to let you know I love you guys both and I wish it hadn't gone this way."</p>
<h2>What is the fallout?</h2>
<p>Out of an abundance of caution, the governor discouraged Minnesotans from attending protests against the Trump administration's policies that took place in the state, and around the US, on Saturday.</p>
<p>The attacks have also put a renewed spotlight on the issue of political violence in the US.</p>
<p>President Trump survived two assassination attempts in 2024.</p>
<p>In April this year, the house of Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, was the target of an arson attack.</p>
