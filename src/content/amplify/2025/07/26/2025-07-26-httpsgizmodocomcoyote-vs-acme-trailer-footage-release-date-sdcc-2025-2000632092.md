<p>Two years ago, <em><a href="https://gizmodo.com/coyote-acme-shelved-john-cena-looney-tunes-warner-bros-1851009248">Coyote vs. Acme</a> </em>was a victim of Warner Bros. Discovery’s cost-cutting cancellation wave. Despite <a href="https://gizmodo.com/coyote-vs-acme-cancellation-crew-reacts-1851014168">public outcry</a>, it initially seemed like it’d never see the light of day. But things have worked out in its favor: it’s <a href="https://gizmodo.com/coyote-vs-acme-theatrical-release-warner-bros-ketchup-entertainment-2000582796">coming to theaters next year</a>, and San Diego Comic-Con offered a first look at what’s to come in the Looney Tunes’ latest movie, and more importantly, a release date: August 28, 2026.</p>
<p>A mix of live-action and animation, the film sees Wile E. Coyote finally becoming fed up with Acme’s products blowing up whenever he tries catching the Roadrunner. To get some measure of justice, he decides to sue them with the help of Will Forte’s human lawyer, Kevin Avery, who could also really use a win. During their legal back-and-forth between Acme and its lawyer Buddy Crane (John Cena), Kevin and Wile become friends and start to unpack why those Acme products are always such a bust.</p>

<p>The panel started with moderator Paul Scheer claiming the movie was one Acme (read: Warner Bros.) “didn’t want you to see,” followed by an interruption from Acme lawyer Bill Pellicano (P.J. Byrne) issuing cease-and-desist papers, claiming the film was anti-Acme. But the panel continued with the reveal the release date, a bit about the shooting process (a puppet stood in for Coyote), and all the Looney Tunes cameos (more than 10, is the word.) But the highlights were three clips that were shown</p>
<p>The first was almost a tease. Coyote is looking through old blueprints while thinking about all the times he tried and failed to get the Roadrunner. So, it cuts between him now and lots of old-school cartoons. This is set to Johnny Cash’s “Hurt,” and it’s hilarious. But just then, a commercial comes on TV. It’s Forte’s character, Kevin Avery, with very specific questions about faulty Acme products. It’s one of those “If this has happened to you, call us” type deals. Coyote goes crazy. This is what he’s been waiting for.</p>
<p>The second clip was a six-minute sequence of Coyote’s first day in court. Luis Guzmán is the judge, and when he sees a cartoon is part of the case, he chooses a cartoon gavel instead of the normal one. Cena’s suave Acme lawyer, wearing a gaudy bolo tie, gives his opening remarks, and they’re as smooth as silk. He makes it seem like none of this is Acme’s fault. Instead, it’s the coyote who is reckless. As he speaks, we see a human courtroom sketch artist, as well as the cartoon one, who is sculpting out of ice instead of drawing. The jury is mostly human too, save for one cartoon, Miss Prissy, who is knitting. She says she “just laid an egg” after Cena’s speech.</p>
<p>After being blown away by Cena’s speech, Avery gets up to give his opening remarks, and it’s a mess. He can barely speak. Coyote attempts to help by digging into a box of evidence and pulling out a Rocket Rollerblade. Avery uses it as an example of a faulty Acme product because it doesn’t even turn on. So, he flicks the switch and nothing happens, but eventually flames blow out the back, burn Coyote and then it flies all around the room causing a ruckus. This is bad.</p>
<p>Back at the hotel, Avery is watching TV when the phone rings. It’s a mysterious voice who claims he can help with the case. Avery doesn’t know who it is, but we do. It’s Bugs Bunny. Bugs gives Avery an address where he can get some key information to bring down Acme. And that’s it.</p>
<p>The panel ended with a tease for the trailer but, that pesky Acme lawyer came back. He called the head of Acme, which was Foghorn Leghorn, who said they had shut the whole panel down. Acme interns flooded the stage, ushering everyone off. But not before Forte ran back in, grabbed the microphone and said, “Play the trailer” as he was chased off.</p>
<p>The trailer had lots of the footage we described above, but also a ton of huge stunts, both in live action and animation. Lots of cameos from Looney Tunes characters and the phrase “The movie Acme didn’t want you to see,” in blood. All in all, it was one of the more fun panels in recent Comic-Con memory. And while it’s a bummer we need to wait another year for the movie, at least it’s coming out at all.</p>
<p>Also starring Lana Condor and Tone Bell, <em>Coyote vs. Acme </em>hits theaters worldwide August 28, 2026.</p>
