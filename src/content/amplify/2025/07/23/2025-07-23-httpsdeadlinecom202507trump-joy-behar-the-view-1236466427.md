<p>The White House lashed out at <a data-tag="joy-behar" href="https://deadline.com/tag/joy-behar/">Joy Behar</a> after she said that <a data-tag="donald-trump" href="https://deadline.com/tag/donald-trump/">Donald Trump</a>‘s attacks on his predecessor, <a data-tag="barack-obama" href="https://deadline.com/tag/barack-obama/">Barack Obama</a>, were motivated by jealousy, while noting the current president’s role in the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.</p>
<p>On <em><a data-tag="the-view" href="https://deadline.com/tag/the-view/">The View</a></em> on Wednesday, Behar and the other co-hosts talked about Obama’s response to Trump’s claim that his predecessor was guilty of treason. The Trump administration claims that Obama and his team conspired to alter intelligence assessments to boost the notion that Russia was attempting to help Trump get elected in 2016.</p>
<p>Obama’s spokesperson called the allegations “bizarre” and a “weak attempt at distraction.”</p>
<p>On <em>The View</em>, Behar said, “First of all, who tried to overthrow the government on January 6th? Who was that again?”</p>
<p>The thing about him is is so jealous of Obama, because Obama is everything that he is not. Trim. Smart. Handsom. Happily married. And can sing Al Green’s song Let’s Stay Together better than Al Green.”</p>
<p>White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said, “Joy Behar is an irrelevant loser suffering from a severe case of Trump Derangement Syndrome. It’s no surprise that <em>The View</em>’s ratings hit an all-time low last year. She should self-reflect on her own jealousy of President Trump’s historic popularity before her show is the next to be pulled off air.” EW first reported on the White House response.</p>
<p>Trump celebrated the decision by CBS to cancel <em>The Late Show with Stephen Colbert</em>, hosted by another of his critics. On Tuesday, he predicted that ABC’s Jimmy Kimmel “is NEXT to go in the untalented Late Night Sweepstakes and, shortly thereafter, Fallon will be gone. These are people with absolutely NO TALENT, who were paid Millions of Dollars for, in all cases, destroying what used to be GREAT Television. It’s really good to see them go, and I hope I played a major part in it!”</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard appeared at the White House press briefing to talk about the release of new documents from 2016. That was a GOP House Intelligence Committee report on Russian interference, casting doubt on the intelligence that Russian President Vladimir Putin favored Trump to win the election.</p>
<p>But a 2020 bipartisan report from the Senate Intelligence Committee concluded that Russia did interfere in the election, while detailing contacts between Trump campaign officials and Russian influence actors.</p>
<p>Obama’s spokesperson said that “nothing in the document issued last week undercuts the widely accepted conclusion that Russia worked to influence the 2016 presidential election but did not successfully manipulate any votes.”</p>
