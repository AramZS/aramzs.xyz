  Trump administration increases scrutiny of George Mason University - The
  Washington Post
---
<p>The Education Department is investigating George Mason University over the alleged use of race in the hiring and promotion of faculty.</p>
<p>Weeks after the University of Virginia’s president <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/06/27/uva-president-submits-resignation-trump-justice/">resigned</a> amid <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/07/02/university-of-virginia-justice-department-investigation-letters/">pressure</a> from the Justice Department, the Trump administration is increasing its scrutiny of another large public university in the state.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the Education Department said it had opened its second civil rights investigation in two weeks into George Mason University, this one over the alleged use of race in the hiring and promotion of faculty members. The department said it had received complaints from multiple professors, including about university initiatives to make the demographics of faculty better reflect the diversity of its student body.</p>
<p>“This kind of pernicious and wide-spread discrimination — packaged as ‘anti-racism’ — was allowed to flourish under the Biden Administration, but it will not be tolerated by this one,” Craig Trainor, the department’s acting assistant secretary for civil rights, said in a news release.</p>
<p>George Mason spokesperson Paul Allvin said the university does not discriminate based on race or otherwise and would work in “good faith to give a full and prompt response” to the Education Department.</p>
<p>He added that officials had learned lessons from the scrutiny of U-Va. — which was accused by federal officials of slow-walking its responses to federal inquiries — and would devote “significant resources to make sure we don’t keep anybody waiting.”</p>
<p>Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s office did not respond to multiple requests for comment Thursday, though the Republican leader has moved to slash diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives in K-12 education and colleges during his tenure. The office of Virginia Attorney General Jason S. Miyares (R) declined to comment, noting that it serves as legal counsel for George Mason.</p>
<p>This month, the Education Department notified George Mason that it had launched an investigation into the university’s alleged failure to address a hostile environment for Jewish students and faculty. George Mason was also one of 60 universities to which the department <a href="https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/us-department-of-educations-office-civil-rights-sends-letters-60-universities-under-investigation-antisemitic-discrimination-and-harassment">sent </a>letters in March over their handling of alleged antisemitism and harassment, and the university previously faced a probe under the Biden administration.</p>
<p>“We take it very seriously because we see what can happen, and we also take accusations of discrimination very seriously,” Allvin said. “Once we had the complaint filed last week, we knew this was probably the beginning of a cycle.”</p>
<p>The stacking of investigations against George Mason follows a similar pattern that occurred in the Trump administration’s inquiries into U-Va. In that case, Justice Department officials sent U-Va.<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/07/02/university-of-virginia-justice-department-investigation-letters/"> seven letters</a> over two months alleging a widening array of civil rights violations related to DEI and antisemitism, showing increasing frustration toward the university’s failure to properly respond to its requests.</p>
<p>The pressure campaign culminated in James E. Ryan’s <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/06/27/uva-president-submits-resignation-trump-justice/">resignation</a> late last month.</p>
<p>The new George Mason investigation is also the latest effort by the Trump administration to shape American higher education in its image, using the threat of federal funding cuts to achieve myriad policy goals. In recent months, it has frozen billions in funding at Harvard and other schools, reached a deal with the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/07/01/upenn-bars-transgender-athletes/">University of Pennsylvania</a> in which that school will bar transgender athletes from competing in women’s sports, and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/06/26/university-california-trump-dei-investigation-hiring-justice/">launched</a> an investigation into the University of California system over alleged race- or sex-based hiring.</p>
<p>“The federal government has no business strong-arming university boards to install political loyalists or punish academic leaders for failing to march in lockstep with their agenda,” Sens. Tim Kaine and Mark R. Warner, both Virginia Democrats, wrote in an op-ed published in the Richmond Times-Dispatch.</p>
<p>Ted Mitchell, president of the American Council on Education, said the probes into George Mason show the Trump administration is not interested only in “celebrity universities” like Harvard, and that institutions of higher education nationally will be watching.</p>
<p>“It’s entirely appropriate for the government to open investigations when an allegation of some sort of violation of civil rights has taken place,” he said. “While there is certainly pressure on George Mason to respond promptly, we will be watching to see whether the Trump administration follows due process with this investigation, or if it will again use thuggish tactics to beat an institution into submission.”</p>
<p>In announcing its new inquiry, the Education Department alleged that George Mason considered race, sex and other characteristics in recruiting, preferred diverse candidates in hiring, and created an anti-racism task force to help craft university policies. The agency told the university the opening of an investigation does not mean officials have determined that the university violated federal law, according to a letter obtained by The Washington Post.</p>
<p>Allvin, the George Mason spokesperson, said the university had not received the full complaint as of Thursday afternoon. But he said that at first glance, the allegations appeared to stem from old policies that probably are no longer in effect.</p>
<p>In recent months, as the Trump administration issued directives to eliminate DEI, George Mason President Gregory Washington has <a href="https://www.gmu.edu/news/2025-03/update-federal-requirements-president-washington">told</a> university community members that the school was meeting the requirements of federal mandates. Still, he said he renamed the university’s former DEI office as the Office of Access, Compliance and Community, saying the term DEI has “become so broadly misunderstood and misapplied as to become counterproductive to our work.”</p>
<p>Once a commuter school, the Northern Virginia institution has rapidly grown in recent years to become the state’s largest public four-year university, with more than 40,000 students. Unlike other universities the Trump administration has targeted, George Mason is not highly selective, accepting 90 percent of applicants.</p>
<p>Its Antonin Scalia Law School, named for the conservative former Supreme Court justice, markets itself as a place where lawyers will be exposed to all viewpoints and has received tens of millions of dollars from conservative groups such as the Charles Koch Foundation.</p>
<p>The university’s governing board, whose current members are all Youngkin appointees, has considered but not passed a resolution calling for the dismantling of DEI at the school. That consideration drew pushback from many liberal students and faculty members, who see those initiatives as making the school more welcoming.</p>
<p>Last week, as the Education Department’s initial inquiry into George Mason became public, Washington came under fire from various conservative commentators.</p>
<p>An <a href="https://www.city-journal.org/article/george-mason-university-president-gregory-washington-dei-anti-semitism">article </a>in City Journal, a publication linked to the conservative think tank Manhattan Institute, called Washington a “disastrous president” whose record “warrants his resignation or dismissal.” Bacon’s Rebellion, a conservative blog focused on Virginia politics, quoted from that article<a href="https://www.baconsrebellion.com/and-in-other-higher-ed-news/"> in a post</a> and declared: “Don’t be surprised if GMU attracts Department of Justice scrutiny.”</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://president.gmu.edu/news/2025-07/george-mason-affirms-its-measures-ensure-safe-and-welcoming-campus-response-new">July 3 note</a> to the campus community, Washington defended his policies — an unusual move, as many schools have tried to keep their heads down so as not to attract further attention from the Trump administration.</p>
<p>“As we prepare a response to the complaint, it is important that we all have an accurate understanding of how safe and welcoming the George Mason community is,” he wrote before ticking through his record on addressing antisemitism.</p>
<p>George Mason, like many college campuses, experienced protests after the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel and the resulting war. But Washington said there were not widespread arrests, encampments or destruction of property on the local campus. He said the university received praise from the Jewish Community Relations Council of Greater Washington for using the university’s security and disciplinary measures to prevent protesters from harming those on campus.</p>
<p>“Our data continues to show that our environment has dramatically improved since the horrific Hamas attacks of 2023, so we are perplexed to be receiving this investigation at this time,” he wrote. “Nevertheless, we will respond in a forthright, direct, and timely manner to this and any inquiry.”</p>
<p>The university has, however, seen high-profile incidents of antisemitism on the campus in the past year. In December, two pro-Palestinian activists were <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2024/12/08/george-mason-university-pro-palestinian-activists/">banned </a>from campus for alleged vandalism after police said they found guns, magazines and antisemitic insignia belonging to their relatives inside their family’s home. Some Jewish students at the time felt Washington’s response — which included suspending the Students for Justice in Palestine chapter — was insufficient, while others on campus felt the punishment was inappropriate.</p>
<p>That same month, a GMU student was <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/12/19/gmu-student-charged-plotting-attack/">charged</a> after being accused of plotting an attack targeting Jewish people in New York, and the school expelled him.</p>
<p>The school added “enhanced security measures” to create a “protective web” around campus during its fall commencement that month, a spokesperson previously told The Post.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Michael Meese, vice rector on the GMU Board of Visitors, wrote in a note to members of the body that claims the university had not made changes to its DEI policies or failed to combat antisemitism are false.</p>
<p>“While we must hold the administration accountable,” he wrote in the note obtained by The Post, “we should avoid being misled by false claims.”</p>
