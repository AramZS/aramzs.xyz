<p>The announcement that billionaire Patrick Soon-Shiong plans to <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/patrick-soon-shiong-to-retain-ownership-in-la-times-public-sale-to-raise-75-million/">take the Los Angeles Times public</a> was met with a mix of panic and derision inside the building this week. But outside, astute investors point to another media public offering that serves as an appropriate parallel: Newsmax.</p>
<p>Soon-Shiong broke the news on Monday during an interview with Jon Stewart on “The Daily Show,” saying he wanted to “democratize” the newspaper by taking it public, earning applause from the host and his audience. But as details emerged the following day, it wasn’t so simple.</p>
<p>It turns out that Soon-Shiong — whose <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/los-angeles-times-kevin-merida-billionaire-patrick-soon-shiong-meddling/">meddling in the newsroom</a> and cuts to staffing have made him unpopular and a cause for skepticism among much of his editorial team — is likely mimicking a successful bid to raise capital and go public earlier this year by Newsmax, the ultra-conservative cable news network run by Trump devotee Chris Ruddy and a fan of conspiracy theories related to the 2020 election and Jan.</p>
