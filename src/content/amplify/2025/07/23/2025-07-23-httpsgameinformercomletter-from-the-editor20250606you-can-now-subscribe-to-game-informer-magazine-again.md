<p>Today, we’re thrilled to unveil the new Game Informer subscription program. We relaunched Game Informer in March so we could return to covering the games we love and sharing that enthusiasm with all of you. <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/letter-from-the-editor/2025/03/25/game-informer-is-back">We told you then</a> that the print and digital magazine would return soon. That time has come, and we can’t wait to share what we’ve been working on.</p>
<p>In the wake of Game Informer’s return, we listened to you, our readers and viewers, and we spoke as a team about how we wanted to move into the future. And we think we have some clear answers. We want to deliver a premium magazine steeped in exclusive access, entertaining articles, and deep insights into gaming that speak through a range of voices squarely to dedicated gaming hobbyists. We want to extend that philosophy into our website, video, streaming, and podcasting efforts, connecting our audience to a deeper engagement with day-to-day events and reveals and the creators behind the games. And we want Game Informer to reach outside of gaming, and build in a way for every subscriber to make the world a little better.</p>
<p>Here's how we’re doing each of those things.</p>
<p>We’re starting by offering a substantial discount for anyone who signs up for a subscription in the coming days. We know everything is expensive right now, but we’ve tried to make membership as affordable as we can so you can help be a founder of this new era of our 34-year-old gaming institution.</p>
<p>The new Game Informer print magazine is bigger and better than before – a true premium gaming periodical. We have roughly 15% more pages in every one of our 10 yearly issues. The cover stock is thicker and higher quality than before; the paper is superior and better able to showcase screens and art. Each issue ships in a polybag to keep it safe as it arrives in your mailbox. Every year, the final 10th issue is a special edition with even more pages, a special cover treatment, and a massive end-of-year celebration of the best in gaming. Across every issue, you’ll find more exclusive features written by a broader range of contributing writers worldwide. Our focus will always remain video games, but we’ll also connect you to stories on the best in tech, tabletop, collectibles, and all the topics that help shape your gaming hobby.</p>

<p>Every subscriber will have access to new issues digitally on the day they launch; in fact, you can read <em>every</em> page of <em>every</em> issue Game Informer has <em>ever</em> published since we began in 1991. The new issues (2025 and later) will be added to the archive every time we publish, exclusively available to subscribers. Here on the site, we’ll have additional articles, photo galleries, travelogues, and more provided exclusively to subscribers, expanding behind-the-scenes access to Game Informer as we cover the games you love. All logged-in subscribers will see reduced ads on the website. And, for our international readers (or if you prefer not to receive the print magazine), our digital subscription is available anywhere in the world.</p>

<p>Finally, video games may keep us inside most of the time, but we feel as many of you do; this hobby connects people, and we truly believe most gamers want to help the world around them. That’s why we’ve partnered with <a href="https://www.stjude.org/">St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital</a> as a new core partnership for our business. When you subscribe to Game Informer, 5% of your purchase price is set aside and donated directly to this worthy charity, which seeks cures and prevention for catastrophic illnesses in children. <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/announcement/2025/06/05/why-we-partnered-with-st-jude-childrens-research-hospital">It’s our small way</a> to link our love of gaming to the needs of a broader world. Your support helps make a real difference.</p>
<p>From the charitable giving we can offer to help kids to the contributors we can invite to bring you the best insights into gaming, it all depends on your enthusiasm and support. Our entire team returned to Game Informer because we love what we do and enjoy sharing that excitement about the gaming hobby with all of you. I hope you’ll come along for this ride with us and help us launch a new era for Game Informer. And I hope your gaming hobby is more fun because you chose to join us.</p>
<p>Play well. Be well.</p>
