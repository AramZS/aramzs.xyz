<p>Police gang databases are known to be faulty. The secret registries allow state and local cops to feed civilians’ personal information into massive, barely regulated lists based on speculative criteria — like their personal contacts, clothing, and tattoos — even if they haven’t committed a crime. The databases aren’t subject to judicial review, and they don’t require police to notify the people they peg as gang members.</p>
<p>They’re an ideal tool for officials seeking to imply criminality without due process. And many are directly accessible to Immigration and Customs Enforcement.</p>
<p>An investigation by The Intercept found that at least eight states and large municipalities funnel their gang database entries to ICE — which can then use the information to target people for arrest, deportation, or rendition to so-called “third countries.” Some of the country’s largest and most immigrant-dense states, like Texas, New York, Illinois, and Virginia, route the information to ICE through varied paths that include a decades-old police clearinghouse and a network of post-9/11 intelligence-sharing hubs.</p>
<p>Both federal immigration authorities and local police intelligence units operate largely in secret, and the full extent of the gang database-sharing between them is unknown. What is known, however, is that the lists are riddled with mistakes: Available <a href="https://www.aclum.org/en/cases/aclu-massachusetts-v-boston-police-department">research</a>, <a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/06/18/dc-police-gang-database-hacked-emails/">reporting</a>, and audits have revealed that many <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/politic-il-insider-chicago-gang-database">contain</a> widespread <a href="https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-calgangs-audit-20160811-snap-story.html">errors</a> and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/dd5643e358c3456dbe14c16ade03711d">encourage</a> racial <a href="https://theintercept.com/2022/01/09/dc-police-gang-database-mpd/">profiling</a>.</p>
<p>The flawed systems could help ICE expand its dragnet as it seeks to carry out President Donald Trump’s promised “mass deportation” campaign. The administration has cited <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/03/trump-el-salvador-venezuela-deportation-prison-cecot-bukele/">common tattoos</a> and other <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/31/us/politics/us-deportations-tren-de-aragua-deportation-guidance.html">spurious evidence</a> to create its own lists of supposed gang members, <a href="https://theintercept.com/2025/03/16/trump-alien-enemies-act-tren-de-aragua-venezuela-deport/">invoking </a>the 1798 Alien Enemies Act to send hundreds to El Salvador’s notorious Terrorism Confinement Center prison, also known as CECOT. Gang databases The Intercept identified as getting shared with ICE contain hundreds of thousands of other entries, including some targeted at <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/ms-13-immigration-facts-what-trump-administration-gets-wrong">Central American communities</a> that have landed in the administration’s crosshairs. That information can torpedo asylum and other immigration applications and render those seeking legal status deportable.</p>
<p>“They’re going after the asylum system on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/02/trump-us-mexico-border-immigrants-asylum">every front they can</a>,” said Andrew Case, supervising counsel for criminal justice issues at the nonprofit LatinoJustice. “Using gang affiliation as a potential weapon in that fight is very scary.”</p>
<p>Information supplied by local gang databases has already driven at least one case that became a national flashpoint: To justify sending Kilmar Abrego Garcia to CECOT in March, federal officials used a <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.tnmd.104622/gov.uscourts.tnmd.104622.43.0_3.pdf">disputed</a> report that a <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/investigations/2025/04/17/maryland-police-officer-report-abrego-garcia-prison/83141240007/">disgraced</a> Maryland cop submitted to a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/04/19/kilmar-abrego-garcia-ice-police-gang-registry/">defunct</a> registry to label him as a member of a transnational gang. The <a href="https://theintercept.com/2025/04/18/trump-kilmar-abrego-garcia-ms13-gang-database/">report cited</a> the word of an unnamed informant, Abrego’s hoodie, and a Chicago Bulls cap — items “indicative of the Hispanic gang culture,” it said.</p>
<p>The case echoed patterns from Trump’s first term, when ICE leaned on similar information from local cops — evidence as flimsy as <a href="https://features.propublica.org/ms-13-immigrant-students/huntington-school-deportations-ice-honduras/">doodles in a student’s notebook</a> — to label immigrants as gang members eligible for deportation. As Trump’s second administration shifts its immigration crackdown<a href="https://theintercept.com/collections/unmasking-ice/"> into overdrive</a>, ICE is signaling with cases like Abrego’s that it’s eager to continue fueling it with local police intelligence.</p>
<p>Nayna Gupta, policy director at the American Immigration Council, argued that this kind of information-sharing boosts ICE’s ability to target people without due process.</p>
<p>“This opens the door to an incredible amount of abuse,” she said. “This is our worst fear.”</p>
<p>In February, ICE arrested Francisco Garcia Casique, a barber from Venezuela living in Texas. The agency alleged that he was a member of Tren de Aragua, the Venezuelan gang <a href="https://english.elpais.com/international/2025-04-06/truths-lies-and-myths-about-tren-de-aragua.html">at the center</a> of the latest anti-immigrant panic, and sent him to CECOT.</p>
<p>Law enforcement intelligence on Garcia Casique was full of errors: A gang database entry contained the wrong mugshot and appears to have confused him with a man whom Dallas police interviewed about a Mexican gang, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/05/17/mistaken-identity-deportation-salvadoran-prison/83643353007/">USA Today reported</a>. Garcia Casique’s family insists he was never in a gang.</p>
<p>It’s unclear exactly what role the faulty gang database entry played in Garcia Casique’s rendition, which federal officials insist wasn’t a mistake. But ICE agents had direct access to it — plus tens of thousands of other entries from the same database — The Intercept has found.</p>
<p>Under a <a href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/CR/pdf/CR.67.pdf">Texas statute</a> Trump ally <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2024/09/16/texas-venezuelan-gang-el-paso-tren-de-aragua-abbott/">Gov. Greg Abbott</a> signed into law in 2017, any county with a population over 100,000 or municipality over 50,000 must maintain or contribute to a local or regional gang database. More than 40 Texas counties and dozens more cities and towns meet that bar. State authorities compile the disparate gang intelligence in a central registry known as TxGANG, which <a href="https://sao.texas.gov/reports/main/22-039.pdf">contained</a> more than 71,000 alleged gang members as of 2022.</p>
<p>Texas then uploads the entries to the “Gang File” in an FBI-run clearinghouse known as the National Crime Information Center, state authorities confirmed to The Intercept. Created in the 1960s, the NCIC is one of the most commonly used law enforcement datasets in the country, with local, state, and federal police querying its dozens of files millions of times a day. (The FBI did not answer The Intercept’s questions.)</p>
<figure><blockquote> <p>“This opens the door to an incredible amount of abuse.”</p> </blockquote></figure>
<p>ICE can access the NCIC, including the Gang File, in several ways — most directly through its Investigative Case Management system, Department of Homeland Security <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/privacy-pia-ice-icm-june2016.pdf?ref=404media.co">documents show</a>. The Obama administration <a href="https://theintercept.com/2017/03/02/palantir-provides-the-engine-for-donald-trumps-deportation-machine/?ref=404media.co">hired Palantir</a>, the data-mining company co-founded by billionaire former Trump adviser Peter Thiel, to build the proprietary portal, which makes countless records and databases immediately <a href="https://www.404media.co/ice-just-paid-palantir-tens-of-millions-for-complete-target-analysis-of-known-populations/">available to ICE agents</a>. Palantir is currently expanding the tool, having signed a <a href="https://www.404media.co/inside-a-powerful-database-ice-uses-to-identify-and-deport-people/">$96 million contract</a> during the Biden administration to upgrade it.</p>
<p>TxGANG isn’t the only gang database ICE can access through its Palantir-built system. The Intercept trawled the open web for law enforcement directives, police training materials, and state and local statutes that mention adding gang database entries to the NCIC. Those The Intercept identified likely represent a small subset of the jurisdictions that upload to the ICE-accessible clearinghouse.</p>
<p>New York Focus<a href="https://nysfocus.com/2025/04/23/trump-ice-new-york-gang-database-deportation"> first reported</a> the NCIC pipeline-to-immigration agents when it uncovered a 20-year-old gang database operated by the New York State Police. Any law enforcement entity in the Empire State can submit names to the statewide gang database, which state troopers then consider for submission to the NCIC. The New York state gang database contains more than 5,100 entries and has never been audited.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://wilenet.widoj.gov/sites/default/files/public_files-2023-02/2023_advanced_handout_wilenet.pdf">Wisconsin Department of Justice</a>, which did not respond to requests for comment, has instructed its intelligence bureau on how to add names to the NCIC Gang File as recently as 2023, The Intercept found. Virginia has enshrined its gang database-sharing in <a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title52/chapter1/section52-8.6/">commonwealth law</a>, which explicitly requires NCIC uploading. In April, Virginia authorities <a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/news-releases/2025/april/name-1044553-en.html">helped ICE</a> arrest 132 people who law enforcement officials claimed were part of transnational gangs.</p>
<p>The Illinois State Police, too, have shared their gang database to the FBI-run dataset. They also share it directly with the Department of Homeland Security, ICE’s umbrella agency, through an in-house information-sharing system, a local PBS affiliate <a href="https://news.wttw.com/2025/06/02/illinois-state-police-keeps-data-suspected-gang-members-ice-has-access">uncovered last month</a>.</p>
<p>The Illinois State Police’s gang database contained <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/politic-il-insider-additional-gang-databases-illinois-cook-county">over 90,000</a> entries as of 2018. The data-sharing with Homeland Security flew under the radar for 17 years and likely violates Illinois’s 2017 sanctuary state law.</p>
<p>“Even in the jurisdictions that are not inclined to work with federal immigration authorities, the information they’re collecting could end up in these federal databases,” said Gupta.</p>
<p>Aside from the National Crime Information Center, there are other conduits for local police to enable the Trump administration’s gang crusade.</p>
<p>Some departments have proactively shared their gang information directly with ICE. As with the case of the Illinois State Police’s gang database, federal agents had access to the Chicago Police Department’s gang registry through a special data-sharing system. From 2009 to 2018, immigration authorities searched the database at least 32,000 times, a <a href="https://igchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/OIG-CPD-Gang-Database-Review.pdf">city audit</a> later found. In one instance, the city admitted it <a href="https://archive.ph/Ldnch">mistakenly added</a> a man to the database after ICE used it to arrest him.</p>
<p>The Chicago gang database was <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/politic-il-insider-chicago-gang-database">full of other errors</a>, like entries whose listed dates of birth made them over 100 years old. The inaccuracies and immigration-related revelations, among other issues, prompted the city to shut down the database in 2023.</p>
<p>Other departments allow partner agencies to share their gang databases with immigration authorities. In 2016, The Intercept reported that the <a href="https://theintercept.com/2016/08/11/u-s-government-using-gang-databases-to-deport-undocumented-immigrants/">Los Angeles Police Department</a> used the statewide CalGang database — itself shown to contain <a href="https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-calgangs-audit-20160811-snap-story.html">widespread errors</a> — to help ICE deport undocumented people. The following year, California enacted laws that prohibited using CalGang for immigration enforcement. Yet the California Department of Justice told The Intercept that it still allows the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Office to share the database, which contained <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/system/files/media/ag-annual-report-calgang-2024.pdf">nearly 14,000</a> entries as of last year, with the Department of Homeland Security.</p>
<p>“Each user must document their need to know/right to know prior to logging into CalGang,” and that documentation is “subject to regular audit,” a California Department of Justice spokesperson said.</p>

<p>Local police also share gang information with the feds through a series of regional hubs known as <a href="https://theintercept.com/collections/blueleaks/">fusion centers</a>. Created during the post-9/11 domestic surveillance boom, fusion centers were meant to facilitate intelligence-sharing — particularly about purported terrorism — between federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies. Their scope quickly expanded, and they’ve played a key role in the growth of both immigration- and gang-related policing and surveillance.</p>
<p>The Boston Police Department told The Intercept that agencies within the Department of Homeland Security seek access to its gang database by filing a “request for information” through the fusion center known as the Boston Regional Intelligence Center. In 2016, ICE <a href="https://www.wbur.org/news/2018/12/13/east-boston-student-discipline-to-deportation">detained a teenager</a> after receiving records from the Boston gang database, which used a report about a tussle at his high school to label him as a gang member. Boston later <a href="https://codelibrary.amlegal.com/codes/boston/latest/boston_ma/0-0-0-7416">passed a law</a> barring law enforcement officials from sharing personal information with immigration enforcement agents, but it contains loopholes for criminal investigations.</p>
<p>In the two decades since their creation, fusion center staff have proactively sought to increase the upward flow of local gang intelligence — including by leveraging federal funds, as in the case between the Washington, D.C., Metropolitan Police Department and the Maryland Coordination and Analysis Center, which works directly with the Department of Homeland Security. An <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20798257-20131121-1020-fw-re-pdf/">email from 2013</a>, uncovered as part of a trove of hacked documents, shows that an employee at the Maryland fusion center threatened to withhold some federal funding if the D.C. police didn’t regularly share its gang database.</p>
<p>“I wanted to prepare you that [sic] your agency’s decision … to NOT connect … may indeed effect [sic] next years [sic] funding for your contractual analysts,” a fusion center official wrote. “So keep that in mind…………..”</p>
<p>Four years later, ICE detained a high schooler after receiving a D.C. police gang database entry. The entry said that he “self-admitted” to being in a gang, an <a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/06/18/dc-police-gang-database-hacked-emails/">Intercept investigation</a> later reported — a charge his lawyer denied.</p>
<p>For jurisdictions that don’t automatically comply, the Trump administration is pushing to entice them into cooperating with ICE. The budget bill Trump signed into law on the Fourth of July <a href="https://boltsmag.org/how-the-gop-megabill-would-turbocharge-local-immigration-enforcement/">earmarks some</a> $14 billion for state and local ICE collaboration, as well as billions more for <a href="https://theintercept.com/2025/07/01/big-beautiful-bill-senate-police-funding/">local police</a>. Official police partnerships with ICE had <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ice-partnerships-local-law-enforcement-trump-immigration/">already skyrocketed</a> this year; more are sure to follow.</p>
<p>Revelations about gang database-sharing show how decades of expanding police surveillance and speculative gang policing have teed up the Trump administration’s crackdowns, said Gupta of the American Immigration Council.</p>
<p>“The core problem is one that extends far beyond the Trump administration,” she said. “You let the due process bar drop that far for so long, it makes it very easy for Trump.”</p>
<p><u>IT’S EVEN WORSE THAN WE THOUGHT.</u></p>
<p>What we’re seeing right now from Donald Trump is a full-on authoritarian takeover of the U.S. government.</p>
<p>This is not hyperbole.</p>
<p>Court orders are being ignored. MAGA loyalists have been put in charge of the military and federal law enforcement agencies. The Department of Government Efficiency has stripped Congress of its power of the purse. News outlets that challenge Trump have been banished or put under investigation.</p>
<p>Yet far too many are still covering Trump’s assault on democracy like politics as usual, with flattering headlines describing Trump as “unconventional,” “testing the boundaries,” and “aggressively flexing power.”</p>
<p>The Intercept has long covered authoritarian governments, billionaire oligarchs, and backsliding democracies around the world. We understand the challenge we face in Trump and the vital importance of press freedom in defending democracy.</p>
