<p>The Education Department said Wednesday it has opened civil rights investigations into five universities for offering scholarships that targeted undocumented students and racial minorities, ramping up the Trump administrationâ€™s fight against diversity and inclusion in higher education.</p>
<p>The inquiry will examine complaints from the conservative Equal Protection Project that the schools engaged in discrimination by allegedly showing a preference for foreign-born students. The schools named in the complaint are the University of Louisville, the University of Nebraska Omaha, the University of Miami, the University of Michigan and Western Michigan University.</p>
