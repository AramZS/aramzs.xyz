Bender</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/alan-blinder">Alan Blinder</a></p><blockquote><p>Michael C. Bender and Alan Blinder have been covering the Trump administration’s attacks on Harvard and its efforts to upend higher education.</p></blockquote></i></p>
<p>The Trump administration has opened a new investigation into Harvard University’s compliance with a government-run visa program for international students and professors, targeting the elite college with another aggressive action even as the two sides negotiate a possible settlement to their acrimonious dispute.</p>
<p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio notified Dr. Alan M. Garber, the president of Harvard, of the investigation in a letter on Wednesday, according to a copy of the correspondence reviewed by The New York Times.</p>
<p>Mr. Rubio did not refer to any specific allegation of wrongdoing and instead said the inquiry, which Harvard criticized as retaliatory, was necessary “to assist the department in meeting its policy objectives.”</p>
<p>The investigation targets the university’s participation in the Exchange Visitor Program, which is designed to promote cultural and educational programs with <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/study/exchange.html#:~:text=There%20are%20two%20nonimmigrant%20visa,certain%20international%20cultural%20exchange%20programs.">visas for a variety of applicants</a>, including students and professors as well as researchers, interns and au pairs.</p>
<p>Mr. Rubio’s letter gave Harvard a one-week deadline to produce a lengthy list of university records related to the student visa program. He said the department plans to interview university staff associated with the program and also may want to speak with visa holders.</p>
<p>In a statement, Mr. Rubio said the investigation was aimed at verifying that the visa program does not “compromise the national security interests of the United States.”</p>
<p>“The American people have the right to expect their universities to uphold national security, comply with the law and provide safe environments for all students,” Mr. Rubio said.</p>
<p>In a statement on Wednesday, Harvard called the investigation “yet another retaliatory step taken by the administration in violation of Harvard’s First Amendment rights.”</p>
<p>The university said it was “committed to continuing to comply” with federal regulations and that it would “protect its international community and support them as they apply for U.S. visas and travel to campus this fall.”</p>
<p>Mr. Rubio sent his letter two days after some of the Trump administration’s tactics against Harvard received a skeptical reception from a federal judge in Boston. During <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/21/us/trump-administration-harvard-hearing.html">a crucial hearing</a> in one of the university’s lawsuits against the administration, Judge Allison D. Burroughs’s questions suggested she had serious doubts about the legality of the government’s effort to condition Harvard’s federal research funding on its acceptance of demands from Washington.</p>
<p>She had already shown concerns about the administration's efforts to target Harvard’s enrollment of international students. In May, as the government and Harvard tussled over data requests, the Homeland Security Department <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/22/us/politics/trump-harvard-international-students.html">said it would prohibit Harvard</a> from participating in the Student and Exchange Visitor Program, which provides visas specifically for academic pursuits in the country. Judge Burroughs quickly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/23/us/harvard-trump-international-students.html">blocked that effort</a>, as she did a subsequent proclamation by President Trump that sought to keep Harvard from enrolling international students.</p>
<p>But Judge Burroughs made clear that the government could still conduct some investigations of Harvard. In a ruling in June, she wrote the administration was allowed to review Harvard’s compliance with federal regulations connected to international student enrollment and send related “routine requests for information and documents.”</p>
<p>The latest clash between the university and the government comes amid negotiations around <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/20/us/politics/harvard-federal-funding-trump.html">a potential deal</a>. Officials from both sides have exchanged multiple offers since last month, when the talks restarted after a long hiatus, over the government’s role in admissions, hiring and curriculum. The details of the negotiations remain unclear as talks continue.</p>
<p>Since those talks resumed, though, the administration has accused Harvard of civil rights violations and opened <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/09/us/politics/trump-harvard-data-accreditation.html">a challenge to the university’s accreditation</a>, which could someday jeopardize the ability of Harvard students to receive federal student aid. And U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/18/us/harvard-trump-court-hearing.html">served subpoenas with sprawling demands</a> that included payroll records, years of disciplinary files and any videos Harvard had of international students protesting on campus since 2020.</p>
<p>Mr. Rubio has become increasingly involved in Mr. Trump’s pressure campaign on Harvard and with the administration’s campaign around higher education more broadly.</p>
<p>Mr. Rubio has privately pressed for his counterparts at the Treasury Department to open an investigation <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/11/us/politics/rubio-harvard-sanctions-investigation.html">into whether Harvard violated federal sanctions</a> by collaborating on a health insurance conference in China that may have included officials blacklisted by the U.S. government.</p>
<p>The State Department has started <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/18/us/politics/student-visa-applications.html">screening social media accounts of student visa applicants</a>. Mr. Rubio has also stated that the State Department would target visas held by Chinese students, an initiative complicated by Mr. Trump’s announcement that <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114664632971715644">Chinese students are welcome to study in America as part of his trade deal with Beijing</a>.</p>
