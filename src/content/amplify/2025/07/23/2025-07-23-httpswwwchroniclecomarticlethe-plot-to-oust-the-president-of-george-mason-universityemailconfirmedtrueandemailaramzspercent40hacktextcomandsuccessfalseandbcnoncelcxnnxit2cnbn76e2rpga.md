title: The Plot to Oust the President of George Mason University
---
<p>Christopher F. Rufo, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute and the mastermind behind the moral panic over “critical race theory,” has cemented his reputation as a relentless opponent of diversity, equity, and inclusion in higher education.</p>
<p>His hostility to DEI is matched by his influence among GOP decision-makers. He has organized campaigns against Claudine Gay, Harvard University’s first Black president, as well as several other Black administrators and faculty members at Harvard and other elite institutions. He helped oust Patricia Okker as president of New College of Florida and advocated for dismantling its Office of Outreach &amp; Inclusive Excellence.</p>

<p>Christopher F. Rufo, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute and the mastermind behind the moral panic over “critical race theory,” has cemented his reputation as a relentless opponent of diversity, equity, and inclusion in higher education.</p>
<p>His hostility to DEI is matched by his influence among GOP decision-makers. He has organized campaigns against Claudine Gay, Harvard University’s first Black president, as well as several other Black administrators and faculty members at Harvard and other elite institutions. He helped oust Patricia Okker as president of New College of Florida and advocated for dismantling its Office of Outreach &amp; Inclusive Excellence. Most recently, he led a <a data-cms-ai="0" href="https://www.chronicle.com/article/he-wanted-a-presidency-he-became-a-pariah">successful campaign</a> against Santa J. Ono, who was running to be the next president of the University of Florida.</p>
<p>Rufo has openly discussed his ideological approach and intentions. As he <a data-cms-ai="0" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/07/opinion/chris-rufo-trump-anti-dei-education.html">told</a> Ross Douthat of <i>The New York Times </i>earlier this year, “A medium- or long-term goal of mine is to figure out how to adjust the formula of finances from the federal government to the universities in a way that puts them in an existential terror.” Following suit, the Trump administration has used federal grants to pressure Harvard, Columbia, Cornell, Northwestern, Brown, and Princeton Universities.</p>
<p>Rufo’s playbook is now being used against Virginia’s public universities, with Gov. Glenn A. Youngkin, a Republican, setting the table for a federal takedown. Youngkin’s strategy has two main parts. First, he has appointed political ideologues to university governing boards and encouraged them to impose their ideology to remake higher education in Virginia. Second, alongside the attorney general, he has weakened public universities’ ability to respond to federal investigations that threaten the very mission of their institutions.</p>
<p>We recently watched this play out at the University of Virginia, where Youngkin-appointed board members and conservative alumni groups demanded the <a data-cms-ai="0" href="https://www.chronicle.com/article/how-uva-alums-put-dei-and-a-president-in-the-justice-dept-s-crosshairs">removal</a> of all traces of DEI programs from the campus. Then came the Department of Justice investigation led by Harmeet Dhillon, assistant attorney general for the civil-rights division, and her deputy, Gregory W. Brown, both of whom are graduates of UVa’s law school. With the board unwilling to defend him and the threat that the university would lose millions of federal dollars, UVa’s president, James E. Ryan, <a data-cms-ai="0" href="https://www.chronicle.com/article/the-unexpected-trump-target">resigned</a>. Existential terror, indeed.</p>
<p>In a <a data-cms-ai="0" href="https://richmond.com/opinion/column/article_69a4aad5-e92b-4fc2-b7f0-71be433da652.html">recent opinion essay, </a>Sens. Mark R. Warner and Tim Kaine, both Democrats of Virginia, suggested that Gregory Washington, president of George Mason University, is the next target. The governor has definitely appointed the right board members to carry out the Rufo playbook. Several past and current members of George Mason’s Board of Visitors, including the current chair, Charles Stimson, are employed by or closely connected to the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank and publisher of Project 2025.</p>
<p>Other elements of Rufo’s playbook are also in place. Just as Ryan was forced to deal with organized groups of conservative alumni, many graduates of George Mason’s aptly named Antonin Scalia Law School and its billionaire-funded economics department are key figures in the conservative movement. They seem to be using their roles and influence to coordinate a typical “inside-outside” strategy of character assassination, star chamber investigations, and political pressure to influence the curriculum and governance of the university.</p>
<p>Here are two examples.</p>

<p>First, over the past three years, George Mason has faced <a data-cms-ai="0" href="https://www.heritage.org/education/report/the-dangerous-dei-bloat-virginias-public-universities">significant criticism</a> from the staff of the Heritage Foundation’s Center for Education Policy, which has been led by Lindsey M. Burke for over eight years. Recently, Burke was appointed to the U.S. Department of Education. When she was chair of the George Mason board’s Academic Affairs Committee, Burke leveraged criticism from her colleagues at Heritage to justify her ongoing attacks on the university’s curriculum and its commitment to DEI. For example, she eliminated from the university’s core curriculum a proposed “Just Societies” requirement that would have asked students to engage with DEI concepts twice during their four years of coursework.</p>
<p>The same strategy was employed to incorporate the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s (IHRA) working definition of antisemitism into George Mason’s <a data-cms-ai="0" href="https://universitypolicy.gmu.edu/policies/non-discrimination-policy/">nondiscrimination policy</a> without knowledge or input from faculty members. George Mason adopted this contentious definition, which critics argue conflates antisemitism with criticism of the State of Israel, under the influence of Kenneth Marcus, a former member of the university’s Board of Visitors who was appointed by Youngkin. (Marcus’s appointment has since been denied by the Democratic-controlled Virginia Legislature.) Marcus is also credited with facilitating the adoption of the IHRA definition at Harvard and Columbia. His overarching goal is to embed the IHRA definition in university discrimination policies nationwide, silencing criticism of Israel and suppressing speech in support of the Palestinian people.</p>
<p>Against this politicized backdrop, Washington and his administration have walked a tightrope, responding to claims of antisemitism and to conservative anti-wokeness pearl-clutching with a combination of rational arguments and capitulation to the board’s political and partisan interference in George Mason’s curriculum and day-to-day operations.</p>
<p>But instead of declaring victory and moving on, Washington’s off-campus and on-campus enemies have accelerated their witch hunt against the university’s first Black president, much to the chagrin of faculty and students as well as prominent state civil-rights groups.</p>
<p>Enter the Trump administration.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of July, George Mason has received four federal investigation notices in rapid succession. As reported by <a data-cms-ai="0" href="https://www.chronicle.com/article/an-inside-job"><i>The</i> <i>Chronicle</i></a><i>, </i>the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights is investigating two complaints. One investigation claims that the university and its leaders have allowed a hostile environment of antisemitism to develop on campus. The other is based on allegations that “the university illegally considers race in hiring and promoting employees.”</p>
<p>A claim of “reverse racism” at George Mason against white job applicants is echoed in the federal government’s latest investigation, this time by the <a data-cms-ai="0" href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-launches-investigation-employment-practices-george-mason-university">U.S. Department of Justice, which announced</a> it has “opened an investigation into George Mason University to determine whether it is engaged in discriminatory employment practices based on race and sex.” The Department of Justice is also investigating “whether the university has denied equal treatment of individuals based on race or national origin, in violation of Title VI.”</p>
<p>We take civil-rights complaints seriously, but these investigations seem to be politicized, scripted, and coordinated by government officials, university board members, a small group of faculty members, and outside conservative journalists, bloggers, and ideologues. For example, the day after George Mason was informed of the antisemitism complaint — despite neither the Department of Education nor the university having issued a public statement — the right-wing <i>Washington Free Beacon</i> reported on its existence. The article’s author, Jessica Costescu, is a former intern at, as you might guess, the Heritage Foundation.</p>
<p>On that same day, July 2, <a data-cms-ai="0" href="https://www.city-journal.org/article/george-mason-university-president-gregory-washington-dei-anti-semitism"><i>City Journal</i></a>, a publication of the Manhattan Institute, published a column by Ian Kingsbury, a senior fellow at the Educational Freedom Institute, titled “George Mason University’s Disastrous President.” Citing a debunked Heritage-authored anti-DEI study and the Education Department’s threadbare allegations of antisemitism on campus, Kingsbury called for Washington’s ouster.</p>
<p>The interconnections among the players in this little piece of political theater boggle the mind. For example, the Heritage Foundation’s Jay P. Greene wrote the report, since <a data-cms-ai="0" href="https://president.gmu.edu/news/2023-09/concerns-and-invitation-heritage-foundation">debunked by George Mason administrators, </a>on “DEI bloat” that Kingsbury cited in his <i>City Journal</i> hit piece. It turns out that Jay Greene was a member of Kingsbury’s doctoral committee, and they frequently collaborate on articles. Greene is also a fellow at the <a data-cms-ai="0" href="https://www.efinstitute.org/about/">Education Freedom Institute</a>, where Lindsey Burke once served as a board member. Until recently, Greene also worked for Burke at the Heritage Foundation. Around and around we go.</p>
<p>On July 3, the right-wing site <a data-cms-ai="0" href="https://libertyunyielding.com/2025/07/03/george-mason-university-begins-orientation-with-a-land-acknowledgment/">Liberty Unyielding</a> published a critique of George Mason for including a land-acknowledgment statement in one of its new student-orientation videos. There are legitimate criticisms about land acknowledgments, especially when they are treated as performative or perfunctory. But still, critiquing an orientation video for referencing “Turtle Island,” an indigenous creation myth, seems like the smallest of small potatoes.</p>
<p>Yet the pile-on did not end there. On July 4, <a data-cms-ai="0" href="https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/george-mason-university-wastes-no-time-promoting-anti-american-ideology/"><i>National Review</i></a> published a piece by George Leef, director of external affairs at the conservative James G. Martin Center for Academic Renewal, referencing the Liberty Unyielding story. The <i>National Review</i> article is titled “George Mason University Wastes No Time Promoting Anti-American Ideology.”</p>
<p>Based on this circular, self-referential discourse, <a data-cms-ai="0" href="https://www.baconsrebellion.com/and-in-other-higher-ed-news/"><i>Bacon’s Rebellion</i></a>, a conservative political blog run by James A. Bacon, then posted an article predicting that George Mason could be the next university to be investigated by the Department of Justice, and Washington might be the next university president forced to step down. Lo and behold, he was right. It’s almost as if he had inside information.</p>
<p>All of this is part of the strategy Rufo laid bare in an interview with <i>Politico </i>— publish relentless character assassination attacks in right-wing media until mainstream outlets feel they can no longer ignore the allegations, however specious or trivial. The aim is to carry out a public extortion campaign designed to justify a prearranged federal civil-rights investigation, where the feds threaten to withhold all federal funding unless the university capitulates, or the university’s president resigns or is removed. Their first victim in Virginia was UVa’s James Ryan. Now they’re out for George Mason’s Gregory Washington.</p>
<p>The most confusing aspect of this multipronged MAGA-movement attack on Washington is that he has already given his conservative critics everything they wanted. First, far from ignoring antisemitism on campus, Washington and his team have been aggressive — sometimes excessively so — in responding to allegations of antisemitic speech following Hamas’s attack on Israel in October 2023. Over all, George Mason has taken stringent policing measures to prevent violence, including implementing an anti-mask policy transparently aimed at students wearing keffiyehs.</p>
<p>If anything, Washington’s post-October 7 policies have repressed protected pro-Palestinian speech and suppressed criticism of Israel. For example, Washington and his team suspended George Mason’s Students for Justice in Palestine chapter without due process. They assisted local law enforcement in raiding students’ homes over minor acts of vandalism, such as spray-painting. But recently, over 80 Jewish faculty members signed a statement, <a data-cms-ai="0" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wxei89FAUnsTzpt4J_9duygIsSw2qEsMWv25kTFI0g0/edit?tab=t.0">Not in Our Name,</a> condemning the “attack on our university community and our GMU president that is quickly intensifying under a false, racially divisive, and deeply cynical claim of combating antisemitism.”</p>
<p>Further, the idea that somehow applicants of color are getting some systemic leg up over white applicants is ludicrous. Over the last three years (2022-24), the number of Black tenured/tenure-track faculty has actually decreased by two, while the number of Hispanic/Latino faculty has increased by two. This is not exactly a diversity hiring spree.</p>
<p>More to the point, over the past year, under pressure from a board dominated by political operatives, Washington has systematically dismantled virtually all programs and offices related to DEI. Last May, when the board considered a sweeping anti-DEI resolution (much like one that passed earlier at UVa and Virginia Tech), they decided to table the motion. It was moot. Washington had already killed diversity programming at the university.</p>
<p>Let’s be clear: This campaign against George Mason and its president isn’t about antisemitism or so-called reverse racism. It’s about political control — plain and simple. The MAGA movement and its allies aim to seize control of public higher education in Virginia, using board appointments, fabricated grievances, and orchestrated media smears to intimidate faculty, silence students, and remake universities in their ideological image. They don’t want independent thought — they seek obedience.</p>
<p>This campaign was never about policy; it was always about power. Once Washington’s critics topple him, they’ll move on to the next president, the next university, the next target of their manufactured outrage.</p>
<p>This is the Rufo doctrine in action: fabricate a crisis, flood the zone with misinformation, start coordinated media attacks, trigger federal investigations, and force institutions to collapse under the weight of bad-faith pressure. It worked at UVa. They want it to work at George Mason. If we allow it to happen again, we’re not just losing a president — we’re handing over the keys of public higher education to a political movement that views knowledge as a threat and diversity as a sin.</p>
<p>George Mason University must stand firm. Gregory Washington must remain in office — not just because he deserves it but because caving to this onslaught would betray the very essence of public education.</p>
