<p>Spotify has been hit with another AI controversy after publishing computer-generated songs under the names of dead musicians.</p>
<p>An investigation by <a href="https://www.404media.co/spotify-publishes-ai-generated-songs-from-dead-artists-without-permission/">404 Media</a> found that Spotify is releasing AI-generated songs on the pages of deceased artists — without approval from their estates or labels.</p>
<p>One such track, “Together,” recently appeared on the official page of Blake Foley, a country singer who was murdered in 1989. The song sounds vaguely similar to Foley’s style, but the accompanying image features a blonde, young man who looks nothing like him.</p>
<p>404 Media linked the track to a company account called Syntax Error, which was also responsible for several other seemingly fabricated numbers. One included “Happened To You,” a song supposedly performed by Grammy-winning country singer-songwriter Guy Clark, who died in 2016.</p>
<p>Spotify removed the unauthorised tracks after 404 Media’s report was published. However, while this is a particularly grim example of AI-generated music on the Swedish streaming platform, it’s not the first — and unlikely to be the last.</p>

<p>Last month, an AI-generated band called the <a href="https://thenextweb.com/news/a-viral-band-on-spotify-is-probably-ai-but-theres-no-label-to-tell-you">Velvet Sundown popped up on Spotify</a>. Its top track, “Dust on the Wind”<i> — </i>which sounds similar to the 1977 Kansas hit “Dust in the Wind” — has been played almost 2 million times since its release on June 20.</p>
<p>Velvet Sundown’s Spotify bio now describes the band as a “synthetic music project,” but the platform doesn’t label the tracks — or any other music — as AI-generated.</p>
<p>Daniel Ek, Spotify’s CEO, has taken a consistently laissez-faire approach to managing AI-generated content. Ek previously <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-66882414">said</a> that tracks created with AI were fair game on the platform — unless they mimicked real artists. However, Spotify seems to be doing a lousy job of identifying and removing these <a href="https://thenextweb.com/topic/artificial-intelligence">AI</a> imitations as well, <a href="https://www.headphonesty.com/2024/10/spotify-fake-albums-major-artists-pages">according to</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/14/24294995/spotify-ai-fake-albums-scam-distributors-metadata?utm_source=chatgpt.com">several</a> <a href="https://community.spotify.com/t5/Content-Questions/Release-Radar-this-week-was-almost-all-AI-generated-music/td-p/5630466">reports</a>.</p>
<p>The rise of AI-generated music on Spotify has sparked widespread backlash for several reasons. One involves the frequent use of AI tools like Suno or Udio, which generate entire tracks based on a simple text prompt. While the companies behind them claim that training their models on copyrighted music falls under “<a href="https://thenextweb.com/news/generative-ai-exec-resigns-over-copyright-controversy">fair use</a>,” opponents argue it amounts to copyright infringement. Critics also warn that AI-generated tracks compete for streams, reducing the share of royalties available to human artists.</p>
<p>Sophie Jones, the chief strategy officer at the music trade body the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), called for new protections in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jul/14/an-ai-generated-band-got-1m-plays-on-spotify-now-music-insiders-say-listeners-should-be-warned">an interview with <i>the Guardian</i></a> last week.</p>
<p>“The rise of AI-generated bands and music entering the market points to the fact that tech companies have been training AI models using creative works — largely without authorisation or payment to creators and rights-holders — in order to directly compete with human artistry,” she said.</p>
<p>Another concern is that deceiving listeners with AI-generated profiles and songs is a form of misinformation that risks ruining the reputation of human artists.</p>
<p>To give creators a fair shot, Jones and others argue that streaming platforms should start by clearly labelling AI-generated content. That’s a move <a href="https://thenextweb.com/news/ai-generated-songs-flooding-deezer-spotify">pioneered by rival streaming app Deezer</a>, which has developed an algorithm that can identify artificially created songs made using several popular generative AI models, including Suno and Udio.</p>
<p>“AI is not inherently good or bad, but we believe a responsible and transparent approach is key to building trust with our users and the music industry,” Deezer’s CEO Alexis Lanternier said in June.</p>
<p>“We are also clear in our commitment to safeguarding the rights of artists and songwriters at a time where copyright law is being put into question in favour of training AI models.”</p>
