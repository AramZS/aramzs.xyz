  Columbia expels and suspends student protesters as it nears deal with Trump -

<p>Columbia disciplined more than 70 students who participated in a pro-Palestinian demonstration in May, as it faces ongoing pressure from the Trump administration.</p>
<p>Columbia University disciplined more than 70 students for participating in a May protest of the Israeli government’s actions in Gaza, the school said Tuesday, days after university officials hoping to cut a deal with the Trump administration to restore federal funding attended a meeting at the White House.</p>
<p>The university suspended or expelled more than two-thirds of the students sanctioned in connection with a demonstration at the university’s Butler Library, according to university spokeswoman Millie Wert. Some will have their degrees revoked, while others were put on probation.</p>
<p>The severe actions come as Columbia is in talks with the Trump administration about reversing the government’s freeze of $400 million in funding. The administration has accused the university of not doing enough<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/07/18/antisemitism-task-force-dei-universities-trump/"> to combat antisemitism</a> in the wake of campus protests against the Israel-Gaza war, and Trump officials have pressured Columbia and other universities to stamp out pro-Palestinian activities.</p>
<p>Columbia representatives met administration officials at the White House on Thursday, according to two senior White House officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss ongoing negotiations. After the Thursday meeting, the two White House officials projected confidence that a deal between the administration and Columbia was imminent.</p>
<p>The disciplined students were notified Monday, after the university’s judiciary board finished reviewing all the cases individually, Wert said. Some students who participated in a pro-Palestinian encampment on campus during its spring 2024 Alumni Weekend were also disciplined.</p>
<p>The university said in a statement that the sanctions resulted from a summer-long review of all individual cases and said the students’ disruption of academic activities had violated university policy.</p>
<p>The school declined to detail which university rules the students had violated, citing case privacy concerns. The university’s rules of conduct, among other restrictions, prohibit demonstrations that interfere with other students’ academic pursuits.</p>
<p>Columbia University Apartheid Divest, which has led campus protests, called the disciplinary measures excessive and said in a <a href="https://x.com/ColumbiaBDS/status/1947677553793159605/photo/1">statement</a> Tuesday that students remained “committed to ending US- and Columbia-backed Israeli genocide regardless of the school’s sanctions.”</p>
<p>The government’s freezing of $400 million in funding for Columbia in March was one of the first moves in Trump’s attack on institutions of higher education for alleged campus antisemitism. The administration’s campaign has extended to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/interactive/2025/timeline-trump-harvard/">Harvard</a> and other universities. Harvard has accused the government <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/07/21/trump-harvard-hearing/">in court</a> of violating its constitutional rights by pulling federal funding after demanding far-reaching changes at the university.</p>
<p>While Columbia and other universities have said they are committed to improving the campus environment for Jewish students, many of the administration’s demands and sanctions <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/07/18/antisemitism-task-force-dei-universities-trump/">have had little to do</a> with antisemitism. Instead, Trump officials have sought to strip concepts relating to liberal thinking and diversity from higher education, Washington Post reporting found.</p>
<p>Last week, Columbia University acting president Claire Shipman said the university’s work toward an agreement with the federal government had brought campus issues of discrimination to light, saying that “any government agreement we reach is only a starting point for change.”</p>
<p>“The fact that we’ve faced pressure from the government does not make the problems on our campuses any less real,” she said in a <a href="https://president.columbia.edu/news/our-additional-commitments-combatting-antisemitism">statement</a> reaffirming the school’s commitment to combating antisemitism.</p>
<p>Columbia University Apartheid Divest accused Columbia of working with the Trump administration to suspend students and slammed Shipman’s negotiations with the administration.</p>
<p>“While Columbia likes to position itself as opposed to government overreach, the record demonstrates active collusion, not reluctant concessions,” the group said.</p>
<p>The university has previously punished students who engaged in pro-Palestinian campus activism. In March, one week after the Trump administration canceled the school’s $400 million in funding, the school <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/03/14/columbia-university-students-expelled-suspended-hamilton-hind-hall/">expelled</a> some students who had participated in 2024 protests.</p>
<p>The Butler Library demonstration unfolded <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/05/07/columbia-university-library-gaza-protest/">in early May</a>, while students were studying for final exams. Pro-Palestinian protesters took over the library’s reading room, reiterated demands for Columbia to respond to the Israel-Gaza war and hung flags and banners.</p>
<p>The demonstration became chaotic as protesters attempted to flood into the building and university public safety officers tried to clear them away. New York police officers arrived and made arrests. The university said the protest disrupted academic activities for hundreds of students preparing for finals and said some demonstrators refused to identify themselves or leave the library.</p>
<p>The school initiated disciplinary processes immediately following the demonstration and put 71 students on interim suspension.</p>
<p>Columbia has reformed its disciplinary processes over the past year and made changes to its disciplinary board, removing students from the board and moving it under the provost’s office.</p>
<p>The university said the speed at which all the cases were reviewed was “a testament to the hard work of this institution to improve its processes.”</p>
<p>Columbia University Apartheid Divest questioned the university’s changes to the disciplinary board and said the university’s suspensions “hugely exceed sentencing precedent for teach-ins or non-Palestine-related building occupations.”</p>
<p>The group said the disciplinary letters require suspended students to submit apologies to be allowed to return to campus, and noted that students who refuse to apologize will end up with “de facto expulsions.”</p>
<p>The university declined to comment on the CUAD statement.</p>
<p>Students can appeal the decisions. The students disciplined this week in connection with the 2024 Alumni Weekend encampment represented the final batch of cases from spring 2024, the university said.</p>
<p>“[T]o create a thriving academic community, there must be respect for each other and the institution’s fundamental work, policies, and rules,” the university statement said. “Disruptions to academic activities are in violation of University policies and Rules, and such violations will necessarily generate consequences.”</p>
