<p>Kari Lake, the Arizona Republican politician tasked with overseeing the Trump administration’s <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/media/2025/06/25/kari-lake-congress-testimony/">dismantling</a> of Voice of America, has taken new steps to consolidate power at the agency.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Lake locked Victor Morales — the acting CEO of the U.S. Agency for Global Media, VOA’s parent agency — out of his email and electronic systems, several people with knowledge of the decision told The Washington Post, speaking on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution. And according to a new court filing, Lake has ordered VOA Director Michael Abramowitz, who has been on administrative leave since March and is a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/03/22/voice-america-lawsuit-trump-kari-lake/">lead plaintiff</a> in a lawsuit against her, to accept a new position in Greenville, North Carolina — or be fired.</p>
