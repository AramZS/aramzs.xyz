<p>you may read the headline of this blog and think i’m saying <strong>donkey kong bananza</strong> is a <strong>souls</strong> game. that’s not what i’m saying. i’m saying <strong>donkey kong bananza</strong> is literally <strong>dark souls</strong>, the action roleplaying game developed by <strong>from software</strong>. various aspects carry over to other <strong>souls</strong> games, of course, but i’m just focusing on the literal <strong>dark souls</strong> from 2011. anyway, someone (or someones) who worked on <strong>donkey kong bananza</strong> at <strong>nintendo</strong> loves <strong>dark souls</strong>, and while i can’t literally prove it, the evidence they left behind is unmistakable.</p>
<p>i don’t know why you’re reading a story on <strong>donkey kong bananza</strong> if you’re worried about spoilers but here’s your <strong>spoiler warning</strong>.</p>
<h2>eelevators are primordial serpents</h2>

<p>early into the game, <strong>donkey kong bananza</strong> introduces the player to <strong>eelevators</strong>, eel-like creatures who swallow <strong>donkey kong</strong> and allow him to “teeleport” between checkpoints. <strong>dark souls</strong> features a pair of <strong>primordial serpents</strong> known as <strong>kingseeker frampt</strong> and <strong>darkstalker kaathe</strong>, who swallow the <strong>chosen undead</strong> and transport them to other parts of <strong>lordran</strong>.</p>
<p>i’ll admit i didn’t see the similarities between the <strong>eelevators</strong> and the <strong>primordial serpents</strong> until encountering the large, matronly version of the former, which acts as a vehicle between <strong>donkey kong bananza</strong>‘s separate biomes. watching her swallow <strong>donkey kong</strong> made me point at the screen like the <strong>leonardo dicaprio</strong> meme and shout, “<strong>frampt</strong>!” i don’t think i need to explain how lonely i am.</p>
<h2>mid-level shortcuts</h2>

<p>for a game so cute and joyful, <strong>donkey kong bananza</strong> can be surprisingly difficult at times. fortunately, the game often provides unlockable shortcuts after long stretches of punching and climbing that provide for a quick way to get back to high or otherwise hard-to-reach positions should you fall or backtrack find more collectables.</p>
<p>while it’s true <strong>donkey kong bananza</strong>‘s shortcuts — typically ropes you knock down from one platform to another or the franchise’s ubiquitous barrel cannons for firing oneself between areas — aren’t quite as cool or inventive as those found in <strong>dark souls</strong> and <strong>from software</strong>‘s extensive lineup of <strong>soulslikes</strong>, they still serve much the same purpose.</p>

<p><strong>banandium chips</strong> are one of several collectables available in <strong>donkey kong bananza</strong>. one source of <strong>banandium chips</strong> are unnamed (as far as i can tell) gecko-like creatures found throughout the game’s various levels, much like the way <strong>crystal lizards</strong> provide valuable upgrade materials in the <strong>dark souls</strong> series.</p>
<p><strong>donkey kong bananza</strong>‘s <strong>banandium chip</strong> geckos don’t disappear like <strong>crystal lizards</strong>, but they <em>are</em> very fast and run away from <strong>donkey kong</strong> as soon as they seem him. catching them often requires altering the landscape in some way, such as restricting their movements by removing the type of terrain through which they travel or digging a hole as a trap.</p>

<p><strong>dark souls</strong> director <strong>hidetaka miyazaki</strong> loves poison swamps. he uses them so much, it’s become a running joke among the fanbase every time a new <strong>from software</strong> game comes out and features a gross, goopy area that kills the player slowly.</p>
<p>i don’t have much to say here other than “<strong>donkey kong bananza</strong>‘s <strong>forest layer</strong> is a poison swamp of <strong>miyazaki</strong>-like proportions” so here goes: <strong>donkey kong bananza</strong>‘s <strong>forest layer</strong> is a poison swamp of <strong>miyazaki</strong>-like proportions.</p>

<p>the second major boss you’ll fight in <strong>donkey kong bananza</strong> is <strong>poppy kong</strong>, who uses a special perfume that somehow makes her invisible. i don’t know man, it’s a <strong>donkey kong</strong> game. don’t ask me how any of this ape nonsense works.</p>
<p>beating <strong>poppy kong</strong> requires tracking her movements through the snow-covered boss arena. optional <strong>dark souls</strong> boss <strong>crossbreed priscilla</strong> operates the same way. and sure, while <strong>poppy kong</strong> is much easier to see after she turns invisible, i couldn’t help but compare the two. maybe it’s because i was already primed to see similarities between <strong>donkey kong bananza</strong> and <strong>dark souls</strong>. oh, they both have white hair, too! i’m losing my mind!</p>

<p>i mean, come on. this a <strong>dark souls</strong>-ass boss name if there ever was one.</p>
<p>i wish i could get more analytical and/or philosophical on this topic rather than just making some stupid list but i’m not in that kind of headspace at the moment. in any case, thank you for reading.</p>
