<h4>Is there a public template gallery or similar that I can browse?</h4>
<p>Yes - have a look at the <a href="https://gallery.any.coop"> ANY Experience Gallery </a> : our community marketplace of templates. After downloading the app, you can install any template/Experience to your space.</p>
<h4>How secure is my data with Anytype?</h4>
<p>Upon creating your profile, you’ll receive your very own 12 word mnemonic ‘Recovery’ phrase to protect your account. This phrase is generated on-device and represents your master key generated upon signup, similar to a Bitcoin wallet. It also prevents anyone - including Anytype - from accessing your account and decrypting your data.</p>
<p>All data you create will be stored locally (on-device) first. We use zero-knowledge encryption, meaning that your data is encrypted before it leaves your device to sync with other devices or backup nodes.</p>
<p>You can choose to self-host your own backup node or use ‘local-only’ mode, which means that data will only be synced across verified devices in your local network. <a href="https://tech.anytype.io/any-sync/overview">Check out this page</a> and our <a href="https://doc.anytype.io/anytype-docs/data-and-security/what-is-a-recovery-phrase">documentation</a> to read more about our sync protocol.</p>
<h4>Can I try Anytype before purchasing?</h4>
<p>Yes - anyone can get started with Anytype, free of charge. By default, your account will be E2E encrypted, stored on-device, offline-first, and synced in your local p2p network.</p>
<h4>How often is Anytype updated?</h4>
<p>We aim to ship a cross-platform release once per month. Sometimes, when major features are in the works, it can take slightly longer. Each time we make a release, you’ll see an in-app notification that there’s a new version available. You can always check here for our full, cross-platfrom changelogs. You can also follow our roadmap to keep up-to-date with which features are in the works.</p>
<h4>What kind of license do you use?</h4>
<p>Our protocols are released as open source with a permissive license (<a href="https://legal.any.coop/docs/mit">MIT</a>), enabling anyone to review the code and make modifications with minimal restrictions.</p>
<p>Our applications, on the other hand, are distributed under a source available <a href="https://legal.any.coop/docs/asal">license</a>.</p>
<p>For more information about our licenses and licensing decisions, please visit <a href="https://legal.any.coop/">legal.any.coop</a> or read about our <a href="https://blog.anytype.io/our-open-philosophy/">Open Philosophy here</a>.</p>
<p>We chose to incorporate Switzerland for its regulatory framework that is amenable to startups in our space. Particularly, as it provides a stable macroeconomic environment and legal certainty for companies working with decentralized assets, Switzerland was an optimal choice for us to develop our technology.</p>
<p>As the regulatory environment also gives startups greater determination over their IP produced in Switzerland, this org structure also permits us to properly give back to people who have contributed to generating value for our organization (including contributors from the community).</p>
<p>Furthermore, the choice of incorporating as an Association rather than an LLC or other legal structure distinguishes ANY as a company managed in accordance with commercial practices, but which exists for the greater good.</p>
<p>We consider ourselves a remote team, but we maintain one hub in Berlin (where our team is employed by our local GmbH, a subsidiary of the Swiss Association).</p>
