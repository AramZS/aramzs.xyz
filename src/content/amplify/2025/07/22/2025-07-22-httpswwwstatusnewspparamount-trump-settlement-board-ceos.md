<p>It was the weekend before <strong>Paramount</strong> settled <strong>Donald Trump’s “60 Minutes”</strong> lawsuit and the company’s board had a message for its three co-chief executives, <strong>George Cheeks</strong>, <strong>Brian Robbins</strong>, and <strong>Chris McCarthy</strong>: consider increasing the offer to close the deal. For weeks, according to multiple people familiar with the matter, the executives had held firm at $15 million. But Trump’s legal team—apparently spooked by a looming court deadline that could move the case out of <strong>Amarillo, Texas</strong>—had begun dropping their demand. In recent days, their ask had steadily declined, until it landed at $20 million.</p>
<p>Sensing an opportunity, the people who spoke with <em>Status</em> said, the board wanted to know whether the triumvirate of CEOs were willing to budge and raise their offer from $15 million. Indeed, with the gap suddenly narrower than ever, the question was clear: What were the Paramount chiefs prepared to do to seal the deal?</p>
<p>On the last Saturday night in June, Robbins, Cheeks, and McCarthy huddled to discuss their next move. They favored sticking with a $15 million offer, the people said, given it was symbolically lower than the $16 million<strong> Bob Iger</strong> had approved to settle Trump’s lawsuit against <strong>ABC News </strong>andanchor <strong>George Stephanopoulos</strong>, and a figure they felt comfortable defending internally.</p>
<p>After some back-and-forth, the trio landed on a final proposal: $15.9 million, with three conditions. First, there would be no apology or statement of regret. Second, the payment would be inclusive of all costs, including Trump’s legal fees. And third, the funds would be directed to a school of journalism, not Trump’s presidential library. The last stipulation was a long shot; the CEOs knew the Trump team would likely reject it, but saw it as useful leverage in the final stretch of negotiations, given their real priority was securing the first condition of no apology.</p>
<p>By Sunday morning, the endgame was underway. Three of Trump’s attorneys called the mediator with a flurry of offers, including one to settle at $17 million. But the CEOs wanted to hold firm: $15.9 million was their ceiling, the people familiar with the matter said. That wasn’t enough for Paramount’s board. Observing how close the two sides were, and knowing that new board members were only days away from being installed and then having voting power over a deal, directors called an emergency meeting and decided to take matters into their own hands. In a move that blindsided the executives, according to the people familiar, the board stripped Robbins, Cheeks, and McCarthy of their negotiating authority—an intervention that left the three men frustrated and uneasy.</p>
<p>In the end, the board raised the offer to settle Trump’s complaint by $100,000, announcing late on a Tuesday night that the lawsuit had been settled for an even $16 million (though, notably, with no apology, which McCarthy, Cheeks, and Robbins had fought for). In any case, the CEOs believed the board had been prepared to settle at a much higher figure—and on terms they wouldn’t have accepted. That, more than anything, explained why their authority had been yanked away at the one-yard line.</p>
<p>The behind-the-scenes dealmaking that led to the settlement has come under sharp scrutiny, amid concerns it amounted to a de facto bribe to win Trump’s approval for Paramount’s merger with <strong>David Ellison’s Skydance Media</strong>. The settlement will almost certainly spur shareholder litigation. And, on Monday, Democratic Senators <strong>Elizabeth Warren</strong>, <strong>Bernie Sanders</strong>, and<strong> Ron Wyden </strong><a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/warren_sanders_wyden_letter_to_skydance_on_paramount_settlement.pdf?utm_campaign=the-art-of-the-settlement&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=www.status.news">sent a letter</a> to Ellison demanding more details about the arrangement—particularly in light of Trump’s own claim that, in addition to the $16 million payout, he secured a separate side deal promising him millions more in public service announcements on CBS.</p>
<p>"Is there currently any arrangement under which you or Skydance will provide compensation, advertising, or promotional activities that in any way assist President Trump, his family, his presidential library, or other Administration officials?" the three senators asked, in addition to a slew of other questions, including whether Ellison had "personally discussed" with Trump matters related to the merger.</p>
<p>In any case, since the "60 Minutes" settlement was struck, it appears that the deal is set to get the blessing of the federal government. Ellison met with <strong>Federal Communications Commission </strong>chair <strong>Brendan Carr </strong>last week, conveying his “commitment to unbiased journalism” and the embracement “of diverse viewpoints” to “ensure CBS’s editorial decision making reflects the varied ideological perspectives of American viewers.” The meeting appeared to go well, and I'm told that Carr—the only one holding up the Paramount-Skydance merger—is expected to bless the deal in short order, even possibly as soon as Friday. Carr did not respond to a request for comment.</p>

<p><strong><em>Status Scoop</em></strong> | <strong><em>Newsroom No. 3-No-More:</em></strong> The so-called “third newsroom” appears to be a thing of the past at <strong>The WaPo</strong>. I’m told a memo will go out Tuesday announcing that the <strong>Will Lewis</strong>-led newsroom is rethinking its approach to the nebulous <strong>WP Ventures </strong>initiative. As part of the shakeup, veteran editor <strong>Krissah Thompson</strong>—who’s been with the paper for nearly 25 years—is expected to depart via a buyout. The move, which <strong>Lachlan Cartwright</strong> reported Lewis <a href="https://www.breakermedia.com/p/wapo-third-newsroom-wilderness?utm_campaign=the-art-of-the-settlement&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=www.status.news">was mulling over</a> earlier this month, marks the latest sign of internal restructuring under Lewis’s leadership, with more changes expected to be detailed in the announcement. A spokesperson for The WaPo declined to comment.</p>

<p><strong><em>Trump’s Petty Revenge:</em></strong> The White House <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/07/21/journal-removed-white-house-pool-epstein-00465548?utm_campaign=the-art-of-the-settlement&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=www.status.news">is retaliating </a>against <strong>The Wall Street Journal</strong>, kicking its reporter out of the press pool for <strong>Donald Trump’s</strong> upcoming trip to <strong>Scotland</strong>. Press secretary <strong>Karoline Leavitt </strong>said the change was made “due to the Wall Street Journal’s fake and defamatory conduct,” a clear nod to the <strong>Emma Tucker</strong>-led paper’s reporting last week on an explosive birthday note Trump sent <strong>Jeffrey Epstein</strong> in 2003. The move comes after Trump filed a $10 billion lawsuit against The WSJ and <strong>Rupert Murdoch </strong>over the piece. (The WSJ said it stands by its reporting.) “This attempt by the White House to punish a media outlet whose coverage it does not like is deeply troubling, and it defies the First Amendment,” new <strong>WHCA</strong> president <strong>Weijia Jiang </strong>said in a statement. The retribution marks the second time this year Trump’s White House has blocked a major outlet from covering him, after previously barring the <strong>Associated Press </strong>for refusing to use the <strong>“Gulf of America”</strong> label.</p>

<p><strong><em>Altman Goes to Washington: </em></strong><strong>OpenAI</strong> chief <strong>Sam Altman</strong> is set to speak at a <strong>Federal Reserve </strong>conference on Tuesday, aiming to strike a hopeful tone on artificial intelligence, <strong>Axios’s Mike Allen</strong> <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/07/21/sam-altman-openai-trump-dc-fed?utm_campaign=the-art-of-the-settlement&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=www.status.news">reported</a>. According to a person familiar with his thinking, Altman will present a “third path” between A.I. optimists and alarmists. Rather than taking sides in the growing debate, the person told Allen, Altman is “focused on democratizing benefits (getting them into the hands of people to do stuff), not concentrating them in the hands of the few.”</p>
<p>► Allen additionally reported that <strong>ChatGPT</strong> users send more than 2.5 <em>billion</em> prompts each day across the globe.</p>
