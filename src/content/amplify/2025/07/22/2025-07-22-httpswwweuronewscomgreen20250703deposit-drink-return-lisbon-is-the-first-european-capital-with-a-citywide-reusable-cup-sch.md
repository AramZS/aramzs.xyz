<p>Every night, around 25,000 cups are used in Lisbon's entertainment areas. Although many cups are sold as "reusable", until now there was no system in place to ensure the effective collection, cleaning and recirculation of these containers.</p>
<p>Through a new citywide reusable cup system, supported by a local deposit and return model, Lisbon has become the first European capital to implement an initiative that aims to combat plastic waste, reduce emissions and introduce a smart reuse model in the city's restaurant sector and bustling nightlife.</p>
<p>The first return points operated by TOMRA have been in operation in two of the city's historic kiosks since 27 June. One in Praça de São Paulo and the other in Praça do Príncipe Real.</p>
<p>Consumers receive their drinks in <a href="https://www.euronews.com/green/2025/01/11/people-are-paid-to-return-coffee-cups-in-this-danish-city-does-it-work"><strong>reusable cups</strong></a> upon payment of a deposit. This is fully refunded upon return, simply by touching their card or mobile phone to the collection point. Full implementation of the reusable cup system is scheduled for October 2025.</p>
<p>The innovative partnership was made between the Lisbon City Council, TOMRA and the Association of Hotels, Restaurants and Similar Services of Portugal (AHRESP).</p>
<h2>Policy with infrastructure</h2>
<p>The implementation of the system follows Lisbon City Council's 2024 regulation banning the use of disposable plastic cups - a bold measure that requires a robust infrastructure.</p>
<p>With TOMRA's scalable technology and strong local buy-in, the city is aiming to make real progress on <a href="https://www.euronews.com/green/2025/04/14/fossil-fuels-in-another-form-plastic-recycling-rate-stagnates-at-under-10-report-finds"><strong>plastic waste</strong></a>.</p>
<p>"Lisbon is committed to leading by example, promoting sustainable alternatives to single-use plastics and involving partners in a real change towards more conscious consumption habits," says Rui Cordeiro, Lisbon City Council's councillor for Waste and Circular Economy.</p>
<p>"This is a concrete step towards building a culture of reuse in our city and inspiring other municipalities to follow suit."</p>
<p>The participation of the catering sector is crucial to the system's success.</p>
<p>AHRESP, Portugal's largest hotel and catering association, is supporting cafés, bars and nightclubs in integrating with this new reuse model.</p>
<p>"This initiative represents a necessary change for the HORECA (hotel, restaurant, and café)sector, which is now playing an active and central role in the transition to a more <a href="https://www.euronews.com/green/2025/04/04/going-round-in-circularity-most-brits-confused-by-sustainability-language-survey-finds"><strong>circular economy</strong></a>," says Carlos Moura, chairman of the board of AHRESP.</p>
<p>"The establishments gain not only a practical solution to respond to the new regulations, but also an opportunity to lead, with consumers, a sustainable and positive change of habits for the city of Lisbon."</p>
<h2>Live demonstration at MUDE</h2>
<p>The system was presented during the "Lisbon to Reuse" summit at the Museum of Design and Fashion (MUDE).</p>
<p>Participants - including policy-makers, urban planners and environmental leaders - were able to experience how the system works, including the TOMRA return point and the reimbursement process.</p>
<p><strong>How does it work?</strong></p>
<p>Consumers receive drinks in reusable cups for a refundable deposit of €0.60. The cups can then be returned at TOMRA collection machines throughout the city.</p>

<p>No registration is required - simply tap a card or mobile phone with contactless technology to receive the refund. TOMRA manages the logistics, sanitisation and redistribution of the cups, ensuring a continuous and efficient cycle</p>
<p>By October, the city will introduce a standardised "Lisbon cup" for all participating bars and establishments in the central neighbourhoods, with 17 return points planned for the Baixa area.</p>
