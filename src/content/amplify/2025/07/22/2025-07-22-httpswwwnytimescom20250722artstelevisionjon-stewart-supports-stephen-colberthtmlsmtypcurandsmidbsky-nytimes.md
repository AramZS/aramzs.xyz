<p><em>Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown of the previous night’s highlights that lets you sleep — and lets us get paid to watch comedy. Here are the </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/arts/television/best-movies-on-netflix.html"><em>50 best movies on Netflix right now</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<h2>Too Little, Too Late?</h2>
<p>On Monday, late night hosts responded to the news that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/20/arts/television/stephen-colbert-the-late-show-canceled-comedy.html">“The Late Show” will end next May</a>. Stephen Colbert gratefully acknowledged the outpouring of support he’d received since the announcement last Thursday, while also lamenting the grief and anger fans have been expressing.</p>
<p>“Folks, I’m going to go ahead and say it: Cancel culture has gone too far,” Colbert said, keeping a comical bent.</p>
<blockquote><p>“I want to thank everybody who reached out to me over the weekend, including one text from an unknown number offering a high-paying I.T. work-from-home job for only two to three hours a day. Yes, I am very interested, and I will be sending you my routing number in May. Daddy needs a job.” <em>— STEPHEN COLBERT</em></p></blockquote>

<p>Both Colbert and his friend Jon Stewart offered a similarly expletive-laden response to CBS, while the latter admitted he is “certainly not the most objective to comment on this matter.” Stewart reminisced about his shared history with Colbert on “The Daily Show” back before Comedy Central launched “The Colbert Report” as a successful spinoff.</p>
<blockquote><p>“We were two pretty good-sized fish in a reasonably small basic cable pond. Both of our shows reached an inflection point in 2015. Stephen chose to challenge himself by seeing if he could succeed the legendary David Letterman in, quite frankly, a much bigger pond than the one he and I had been swimming in, and I quit.” <em>— JON STEWART</em></p><p>“And, if I may, watching Stephen exceed all expectations in the role, and become the No. 1 late night show on network television, has been an undeniable great pleasure for me as a viewer and as his friend.” <em>— JON STEWART</em></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>“Now, I acknowledge, losing money, late-night TV is a struggling financial model. We are all basically operating a Blockbuster kiosk inside of a Tower Records. But when your industry is faced with changes, you don’t just call it a day. My God! When CDs stopped selling, they didn’t just go, ‘Oh, well, music, it’s been a good run.’ <em>— JON STEWART</em></p><p>“Well, over the weekend, somebody at CBS followed up their gracious press release with a gracious anonymous leak, saying they pulled the plug on our show because of losses pegged between $40 million and $50 million a year. Forty million’s a big number. I could see us losing $24 million, but where would Paramount have possibly spent the other $16 million … oh, yeah.” <em>— STEPHEN COLBERT, referring to the $16 million Paramount agreed to pay President Trump to settle a lawsuit</em></p><p>“I believe CBS lost the benefit of the doubt two weeks prior, when they sold out their flagship news program to pay an extortion fee to said president. At that time, poor Andy Rooney must have been rolling over in his bed. That’s right, he’s alive. Andy Rooney is alive.” <em>— JON STEWART</em></p><p>“So here’s the point: If you’re trying to figure out why Stephen’s show is ending, I don’t think the answer can be found in some smoking gun email or phone call from Trump to CBS executives, or in CBS’s QuickBooks spreadsheets on the financial health of late night. I think the answer in the fear and pre-compliance that is gripping all of America’s institutions at this very moment — institutions that have chosen not to fight the vengeful and vindictive actions of our pubic hair-doodling commander in chief. This is not the moment to give in. I’m not giving in! I’m not going anywhere — I think.” <em>— JON STEWART</em></p><p>“And now, for the next 10 months, the gloves are off. Yeah! I can finally — I can finally speak unvarnished truth to power and say what I really think about Donald Trump, starting right now: I don’t care for him. Doesn’t seem to have, like, the skill set. Doesn’t have the skill set to be president. You know, just not a good fit. That’s all.” <em>— STEPHEN COLBERT</em></p></blockquote>
<h2>The Punchiest Punchlines (Bawdy Birthday Card Edition)</h2>
<blockquote><p>“Trump is suing The Wall Street Journal for publishing the details of a birthday card that he reportedly wrote to Jeffrey Epstein. The card allegedly has a drawing of a naked woman on it. Trump was like, ‘That’s ridiculous, and can I see it?’” <em>— JIMMY FALLON</em></p><p>“That’s right, President Trump reportedly sent Jeffrey Epstein a letter to celebrate his 50th birthday that ends with, ‘Happy Birthday — and may every day be another wonderful secret.’ And then somebody else signed the letter, ‘Exhibit A.’” <em>— SETH MEYERS</em></p><p>“‘May every day be another wonderful secret?’ I don’t know. To me that sounds kind of like ‘P.S. Remind me to Venmo you for the sex.’” <em>— SETH MEYERS</em></p><p>“In the drawing, a pair of small arcs denotes the woman’s breasts, and the future president’s signature is a squiggly ‘Donald’ below her waist, mimicking pubic hair. Do you know what that means? That means Donald Trump has drawn pubic hair on every executive order.” <em>— STEPHEN COLBERT</em></p></blockquote>
