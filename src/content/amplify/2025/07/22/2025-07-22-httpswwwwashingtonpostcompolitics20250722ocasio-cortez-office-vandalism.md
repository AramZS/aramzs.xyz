  AOC office vandalized with red paint after vote on defense spending bill - The
  Washington Post

<p>Ocasio-Cortez defended her pro-Palestinian record against those who accused her of supporting Israel’s war in Gaza.</p>
<p>The campaign office of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-New York) was vandalized Sunday night, and the congresswoman has received several death threats in the days since a Friday defense spending bill vote, her staff said.</p>
<p>“Last night, our campaign office in the Bronx was vandalized and we are in the processing of cleaning it up,” Oliver Hidalgo-Wohlleben, Ocasio-Cortez’s campaign manager, <a href="https://x.com/oliverhidwoh/status/1947430472017146130?s=12">wrote</a><a href="https://x.com/oliverhidwoh/status/1947430472017146130?s=12"> on X</a> on Monday night. “... In the past few days, we also have received multiple threats on the Congresswoman’s life and we are treating this seriously with our security partners to make sure she, our staff, and volunteers are safe.”</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.nbcnewyork.com/bronx/aoc-campaign-office-vandalized-alexandria-ocasio-cortez/6342425/">footage captured by NBC 4 New York</a>, red paint was splattered across the front of the campaign office and a sign was left at the entrance that read “AOC FUNDS GENOCIDE IN GAZA” in bright red letters.</p>
<p>No one was in the office when the vandalism occurred, and campaign volunteers and the New York Department of Sanitation cleaned up on Monday most of the paint on the exterior of the building and sidewalk, Hidalgo-Wohlleben told The Washington Post in an email.</p>
<p>“We do not have any additional updates on who did the vandalism at this time,” he added. The U.S. Capitol Police said it could not discuss any potential investigations for safety reasons.</p>
<p>On Friday, Ocasio-Cortez voted no on an amendment to the defense spending bill by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Georgia) that would have stripped funding for Israel’s Iron Dome missile defense system, attracting backlash from those who accused her of supporting Israel’s war in Gaza — even though she has frequently spoken out against the war.</p>
<p>Ocasio-Cortez later defended her vote, saying the amendment would have done “nothing to cut off offensive aid to Israel nor end the flow of US munitions being used in Gaza.”</p>
<p>“What it does do is cut off defensive Iron Dome capacities while allowing the actual bombs killing Palestinians to continue,” she <a href="https://x.com/AOC/status/1946588421197046084">wrote</a> on X Friday morning. “I have long stated that I do not believe that adding to the death count of innocent victims to this war is constructive to its end. That is a simple and clear difference of opinion that has long been established. I remain focused on cutting the flow of US munitions that are being used to perpetuate the genocide in Gaza.”</p>
<p>Ocasio-Cortez later voted no on the defense spending bill itself. On Monday, she hit back at those who were falsely saying she had voted to fund Israel’s war in Gaza.</p>
<p>“People exploding this false messaging that I voted for a bill + funding that I quite literally voted NO on. The threat environment this morning is scary,” she <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/aoc.bsky.social/post/3luilqclamc2p">wrote</a> on Bluesky on Monday. “Doesn’t help anyone. Drag me for the position if you disagree but don’t lie. It’s out of control. Saying I voted for this funding is false.”</p>
<p>She also called Taylor Greene’s amendment a “stunt.”</p>
<p>“My record on Palestine speaks for itself. I’m proud of it. One of the strongest in Congress. I throw down for pro-Palestine candidates,” she <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/aoc.bsky.social/post/3luj2ybevas2l">added</a>. “Largely unrecognized work. That’s fine. Disagreements are fine, too. But if you want to toss all that for 1 … MTG stunt, be my guest. I know where I stand.”</p>
