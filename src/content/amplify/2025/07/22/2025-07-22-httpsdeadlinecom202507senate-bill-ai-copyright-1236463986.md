<p>Sen. <a data-tag="josh-hawley" href="https://deadline.com/tag/josh-hawley/">Josh Hawley</a> (R-MO) and Sen. <a data-tag="richard-blumenthal" href="https://deadline.com/tag/richard-blumenthal/">Richard Blumenthal</a> (D-CT) introduced legislation on Monday that would restrict <a data-tag="ai" href="https://deadline.com/tag/ai/">AI</a> companies from using copyrighted material in their training models without the consent of the individual owner.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.hawley.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Hawley-AI-Accountability-and-Personal-Data-Protection-Act.pdf">AI Accountability and Personal Data Protection Act</a> also would allow individuals to sue companies that uses their personal data or copyrighted works without their “express, prior consent.”</p>
<p>The bill addresses a raging debate between tech and content owners, one that has already led to extensive litigation. Companies like OpenAI have argued that the use of copyrighted materials in training models is a fair use, while figures including John Grisham and George R.R. Martin have challenged that notion.</p>
<p>In a statement, Hawley said, “AI companies are robbing the American people blind while leaving artists, writers, and other creators with zero recourse. It’s time for Congress to give the American worker their day in court to protect their personal data and creative works.”</p>
<p>Blumenthal said, “Tech companies must be held accountable—and liable legally—when they breach consumer privacy, collecting, monetizing or sharing personal information without express consent. Consumers must be given rights and remedies—and legal tools to make them real—not relying on government enforcement alone.”</p>
<p>The bill also requires companies to disclose third parties that will access data once consent is sought.</p>
