<p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) plans to abruptly end operation of the <em>RV Nathaniel B. Palmer</em>, the sole U.S. research ship capable of braving the farthest reaches of Antarctica and the Southern Ocean. The move, which has so far not drawn opposition from Congress, is alarming polar scientists: Today, more than 170 researchers sent NSF leaders and Congress a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Rk77rTtcZ_LSoqkTXh571_HxpMhfYDzoO6ZkE6ThU3k/edit?tab=t.0">letter</a> asking the agency to reconsider.</p>
<p>The waters around Antarctica are the harshest on Earth. They contain thick sea ice and mountainous icebergs that menace even the “icebreaker” ships capable of exploring the Arctic. For nearly 60 years, however, the United States has continuously operated science-dedicated icebreakers in the Southern Ocean. They have gathered foundational data illuminating how these frigid waters <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/breakthrough-2023#section_carbon-pump">ferry carbon</a> and heat to the abyss below and how warm currents within them <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-35499-5">drive the melt</a> of the continent’s vast ice sheet. If there was a toolbox for understanding Antarctica, an icebreaker like the <em>Palmer</em> is “the hammer,” says Carlos Moffat, a physical oceanographer at the University of Delaware and co-organizer of the letter. “You need it to get so much done.”</p>
<p>The <em>Palmer</em>, in operation since 1992, was the latest flag bearer in this long line. Capable of hosting two helicopters and up to 45 researchers, the <em>Palmer</em> was best known recently for its daring visits to the Thwaites Glacier, the so-called <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/doomsday-may-be-delayed-antarctica-s-most-vulnerable-glacier">“doomsday” glacier</a> located in a remote region of West Antarctica. There, the ship provided a home base for autonomous vehicles mapping the currents below the ice and helicopter access to its perilous ice shelf.</p>
<p>Although the U.S. plans to <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/complaints-grow-over-1-billion-u-s-antarctic-icebreaker-design">build a new research icebreaker</a>, such a vessel is at least a decade away. Last year, NSF ended support for its other Antarctic research ship, the <em>ARSV Laurence M. Gould</em>, citing escalating costs and budget constraints. That left the <em>Palmer</em> on its own. Many observers expected the <em>Palmer</em> to continue operation until its successor was ready, or close to it. (The U.S. Coast Guard operates heavy icebreakers for opening paths through the ice to McMurdo Station, but these ships are not used for scientific research.)</p>
<p>When NSF <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/final-nsf-budget-proposal-jettisons-one-giant-telescope-amid-savage-agencywide-cuts">released its full budget request</a> for 2026 in late May, one line buried within it noted that the agency would terminate its lease on the <em>Palmer</em>, which is owned by Offshore Service Vessels, a marine transport firm, “to focus support on the [Antarctic] stations and associated logistics.” The budget request also proposed cutting off funding for planning the <em>Palmer</em>’s successor. “That was a one-two punch,” Moffat says.</p>
<p>Unlike many of the projects the White House has proposed killing off at research agencies, the Senate and House of Representatives panels that fund NSF <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/senate-panel-raises-hopes-nsf-will-restore-killed-grants">have not pushed back</a> on this plan. And several weeks ago, at a meeting for the long-term ecological site at Palmer Station, NSF officials told scientists the agency would go ahead with the termination in October.</p>
<p>At that meeting, NSF said the <em>RV Sikuliaq</em>, an icebreaker based in Alaska, would instead support some work currently planned for the <em>Palmer</em>, says Julia Wellner, a marine geologist at the University of Houston and co-organizer of the letter. Although the <em>Sikuliaq</em> is a lovely ship, she says, it “is wholly unsuited to most of what we do in Antarctica.” It has fewer berths and less ability to stay out at sea—and, most critically, it is a far less capable icebreaker. “It’s just not comparable,” she says. Repurposing the ship would also diminish resources devoted to the Arctic—another region of critical strategic importance, Wellner says.</p>
<p>NSF has been opaque about these plans—intentionally so, Wellner believes. “They are purposely not putting anything in writing,” she says. And the planned cancellation is leaving in limbo the scientists who have cruises planned for the <em>Palmer</em> this Antarctic summer, which begins in December. (NSF did not respond to a request from <em>Science</em> for comment.)</p>
<p>For his part, Moffat is hopeful Congress might yet intervene. Although the reports that accompany the NSF spending bills approved recently by the House and Senate panels did not specifically mention the <em>Palmer</em>, they did include language that calls for supporting Antarctic infrastructure roughly at current levels.</p>
<p>Moffat hopes that means the researchers will retain access to the <em>Palmer</em>. Even with new technology such as drones, he says, you still need a platform that can get you close to the ice. “There’s no replacement for putting scientists into the field on a ship.”</p>
