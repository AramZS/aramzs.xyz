<p>Bove <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/06/25/congress/bove-adams-judiciary-00423252">has said that he never advised anyone</a> to violate court orders. DOJ and the Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>
<p>The disclosures to the Senate Judiciary Committee, requested by the panel’s Democrats and shared with POLITICO, come as the committee <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/07/08/congress/panel-sets-vote-for-two-contentious-judicial-noms-00443022">prepares to vote on and likely advance Bove’s nomination</a> to a seat on the Philadelphia-based 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals. Bove’s brief but rocky tenure at the Justice Department appears unlikely to derail his nomination, particularly after Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), a key vote on the panel, suggested Wednesday he was likely to back Trump’s pick.</p>
<p>But the new documents offer a rare glimpse inside sensitive decision-making moments that have defined the administration’s fraught relationship with the courts. And they show that Bove — who has faced scrutiny for <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/02/judge-dismisses-eric-adams-case-00265683">his role</a> in unraveling the prosecution of New York City Mayor Eric Adams and <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/31/doj-purges-prosecutors-january-6-cases-00201904?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAR3y3CFh0atvTYX-swJ6qxErS5tnesGUj7QVZIoPGJ9g12SwFHoIyFoaQYU_aem__1Bg9nhpamljoGA_SsQGWw">firing DOJ officials</a> involved in the prosecution of Jan. 6 defendants — has been at the center of nearly every explosive legal battle of Trump’s second term so far.</p>
<p>Bove served as a top defense attorney for Trump as he fought against multiple criminal cases last year. When Trump was elected, he tapped Bove to be the principal associate deputy attorney general.</p>
<p>Reuveni was a career lawyer at DOJ until he was fired this spring after he told a judge that the administration had mistakenly deported an immigrant in violation of a court order. Then, last month, Reuveni <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/06/24/emil-bove-court-orders-judge-nominee-00420717">sent a 27-page whistleblower letter</a> to the Judiciary Committee accusing Bove of saying that DOJ may need to rebuff court orders that might hinder Trump’s deportation agenda. According to Reuveni, Bove told colleagues that they might have to consider telling the courts “fuck you.”</p>
<p>Top Trump allies in the administration and Congress rejected the letter as the uncorroborated allegations of a “disgruntled former employee” seeking to damage Bove’s judicial nomination. And Bove himself, at his confirmation hearing on June 25, denied proposing defying the courts.</p>
<p>“I have never advised a Department of Justice attorney to violate a court order,” he told senators. “I did not suggest that there would be any need to consider ignoring court orders. At the point at that meeting, there were no court orders to discuss.”</p>
<p>However, Bove stopped short of denying he used the profane phrase during discussions related to the courts.</p>
<p>“I don’t recall,” Bove said.</p>
<p>The new, contemporaneous messages are an answer to the attacks on Reuveni’s credibility, bolstering his claims with real-time messages among senior Trump administration officials</p>
<p>Many of the messages pertain to <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/15/trump-deportation-lawsuit-00232121">an extraordinary showdown on March 15</a>, when immigrant rights lawyers persuaded a federal judge in Washington, James Boasberg, to order the administration to halt an in-progress deportation of 130 Venezuelans to El Salvador. Boasberg ordered that planes containing the men, whom Trump deemed “alien enemies” under a wartime law, be turned around, if necessary, and in any event that the men not be handed over to the Salvadoran government.</p>
<p>Just prior to Boasberg’s decision, Justice Department officials worried that the effort might be stopped by a court. That’s when, according to Reuveni, Bove uttered the “fuck you” line.</p>
<p>After Boasberg’s decision, Reuveni sent a text message to an unidentified colleague referring back to Bove’s alleged comment: “Guess we are going to say ‘fuck you’ to the court. Super,” he wrote. The colleague responded: “Well, Pamela Jo Bondi is. Not you.”</p>
<p>The messages show that in the hours after Boasberg’s ruling, Reuveni repeatedly relayed to colleagues that the immigrants covered by the judge’s order should not be turned over to El Salvador. And he later expressed concern that they seemed to have been handed over anyway.</p>
<p>In one of the newly-disclosed emails, the acting head of Justice’s Civil Division, Yaakov Roth, told Reuveni and other officials that the men were unloaded based on legal advice given by Bove. The email indicates Bove said it was OK to do so because the flights had left U.S. airspace before Boasberg, who initially delivered his order orally, followed up with a written order in the court’s electronic docket.</p>
<p>“I have been told … that the principal associate deputy attorney general advised DHS last night that the deplaning of the flights that had departed US airspace prior to the court’s minute order was permissible under the law and the court’s order,” Roth wrote to Reuveni and two DOJ colleagues on March 16, the day after the controversial flights from Texas to El Salvador.</p>
<p>Boasberg, an Obama appointee, has rejected that interpretation of his orders and <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/16/trump-deportation-el-salvador-federal-judge-00293076">found probable cause to initiate contempt proceedings</a> over potential defiance of his rulings. That process has been halted for now by an appeals court.</p>
<p>The messages also revealed tension between Justice Department attorneys and their counterparts at the Department of Homeland Security as they sought to mount a defense of the administration’s deportation policies in court.</p>
<p>After a different federal judge sharply limited deportations to “third countries” — places where the immigrants have no prior ties — the Justice Department pressed Homeland Security officials to clarify their view of the judge’s decision to ensure that their legal arguments were consistent.</p>
<p>“My take on these emails is that DOJ leadership and DOJ litigators don’t agree on the strategy. Please keep DHS out of it,” shot back James Percival, a senior Homeland Security adviser.</p>
<p>When Reuveni pressed for further clarity, Percival again pushed back sharply: “Ask your leadership. Holy crap guys.”</p>
