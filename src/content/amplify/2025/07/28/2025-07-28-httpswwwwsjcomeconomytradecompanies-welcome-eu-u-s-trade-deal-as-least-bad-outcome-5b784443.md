<div>BRUSSELS—Business leaders on both sides of the Atlantic breathed a sigh of relief that the U.S. and European Union had averted a bruising trade war with their   <a data-type="link" href="https://www.wsj.com/economy/trade/trump-says-he-has-a-tariff-deal-with-european-union-avoiding-trade-war-3ca72c5d?mod=article_inline">agreement on tariffs and investment</a>. Now attention is shifting to assessing the deal’s winners and losers. </div><p></p>
<p>In Monday trade, U.S. energy companies, including producers of liquefied natural gas, got a bump, with shares of <a data-type="company" href="https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/LNG">Cheniere Energy</a> and <a data-type="company" href="https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/VG">Venture Global</a> edging up. European automakers, including <a data-type="company" href="https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/XE/XETR/BMW">BMW</a> and <a data-type="company" href="https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/XE/XETR/MBG">Mercedes</a>, fell.</p>
<div>President   <a data-type="person" href="https://www.wsj.com/topics/person/donald-trump">Trump</a> and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who leads the EU’s executive body, announced the preliminary deal on Sunday that puts   <a data-type="link" href="https://www.wsj.com/economy/trade/european-union-exports-tariffs-explained-64acab19?mod=article_inline">baseline tariffs at 15%</a> for most European goods. In parallel, the EU said European companies would buy $750 billion of American energy products over three years and invest an additional $600 billion in the U.S. </div><p></p>
<p>Aircraft and their components, certain chemicals, semiconductor equipment and some agricultural products looked set to be exempted from the new tariffs. Cars appeared on course to face 15% tariffs, lower than the current level.</p>
<p>Neither side released the text of their agreement, and some elements remained unclear after Trump and von der Leyen described it to journalists on Sunday.</p>
<p>European officials said Monday that some details were still being negotiated. They said they anticipated that the two sides would release a joint statement on the agreement, which they described as a non-legally binding document.</p>
<div>While many details remain unclear, U.S. and European chip stocks rose on the trade deal, with Dutch chip-equipment manufacturer  <a data-type="company" href="https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/ASML">ASML</a>   and U.S.-based  <a data-type="company" href="https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/AMD">Advanced Micro Devices</a>   both up about 3 %. The EU’s Ursula von der Leyen said semiconductor machinery would be subject to “zero-for-zero” tariffs. </div><p></p>

<p>A question mark hangs over pharmaceutical companies such as <a data-type="company" href="https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/XE/XETR/BAYN">Bayer</a> and <a data-type="company" href="https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/FR/XPAR/SAN">Sanofi</a>, because the 15% tariff for those items might be temporary. <a data-type="company" href="https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/XE/XETR/BAYN">Bayer</a> edged down on Monday, while <a data-type="company" href="https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/FR/XPAR/SAN">Sanofi</a> was up slightly.</p>
<p>“The devil is always in the details,” said Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM.</p>
<p>While the outlines of the deal look broadly favorable to many U.S. companies, the effects on food and beverage companies, as well as the pharmaceutical sector, are unclear, he added. European-owned car makers might also be encouraged to move their plants back to Europe to avoid significant tariffs on steel and parts.</p>
<p>“That is not going to make autoworkers in Alabama and South Carolina very happy,” Brusuelas said, alluding to BMW and Mercedes plants in those states.</p>
<p>European industry officials and politicians said the deal leaves the EU in worse shape than before Trump’s return to office but is likely a best-case scenario for European companies because it avoids a bigger fight and will give them more certainty over the coming years.</p>
<div>Crucially for the EU’s international competitiveness, the agreement also leaves the EU’s 27 member states, which share a common trade policy, in a similar position to Japan, which reached   <a data-type="link" href="https://www.wsj.com/economy/trade/u-s-japan-strike-trade-deal-trump-says-ab089e11?mod=article_inline">a trade agreement with the U.S.</a> last week that also set most tariffs at 15%. The two pacts indicate that 15% might be a new minimum tariff level for major allied U.S. trading partners still seeking a deal with the U.S. </div><p></p>
<p>Tariffs at that level are expected to reduce EU economic growth, analysts said. But they added that the impact likely wouldn’t be too severe for the overall economy, especially if other major U.S. trading partners are also facing similarly high duties.</p>
<p>A recent analysis by Capital Economics said a 15% baseline tariff would lower the EU’s gross domestic product by about 0.5%.</p>
<p>“For the EU, today’s agreement is probably almost as good as it could get,” Carsten Brzeski, an economist at ING Bank, said Sunday, noting that the deal avoids an escalation in trade tensions that he said could have been a serious risk for the global economy.</p>

<p>The European Round Table for Industry, a group representing chief executives and chairs of big European industrial and technological companies, said the deal should “restore much needed predictability after a period of great uncertainty.”</p>
<p>The group called for more sectors to be included on a list of products that could see mutual tariffs reduced to zero. And it said the U.S. and EU should work to remove all remaining barriers to trans-Atlantic trade and investment.</p>
<p>Von der Leyen said more products should be added to the list of strategic zero-for-zero tariff exemptions in agriculture, semiconductors and aircraft parts.</p>
<p>Eurochambres, an association of European chambers of commerce and industry, said the agreement represented “the least painful solution” available to the EU.</p>
<p>“Tariffs of any level are always an obstacle to trade and therefore to growth,” said Vladimír Dlouhý, the group’s president. However, he said the agreement gives stability for European companies and will help them plan for the future.</p>

<p>Some industry associations said they weren’t sure what kind of tariffs their sectors would face.</p>
<p>While Trump indicated in comments on Sunday that his global steel and aluminum tariffs would remain at their current 50% level, von der Leyen told journalists that the two sides had agreed to a quota system that would allow a certain quantity of steel and aluminum to enter the U.S. at a lower tariff level. She also said the EU and U.S. would work to address high volumes of low-cost steel on global markets.</p>
<p>European steel association Eurofer said after the deal was announced that it didn’t have enough information to judge how it might affect steel producers.</p>
<p>“EU steelmakers cannot wait any longer to remove the 50% tariffs on the traditional exports volumes to the U.S.,” said Axel Eggert, the association’s director general.</p>
<p>The Comité Européen des Entreprises Vins, which represents European wine companies, said it hoped wine could be included on the list of products covered by the zero-for-zero tariff plan.</p>
<p>Tariffs of 15% would cause significant economic losses for European and U.S. businesses that are involved in different parts of the supply chain, the group said. Coupled with a weaker U.S. dollar, it said tariffs at that level could cause EU wine exports to drop as much as 10% in the short term.</p>
<p>The Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, which represents the American spirits industry, said it wants zero-for-zero tariffs.</p>
<p>Zero tariffs on both sides “will benefit not only our nation’s distillers, but also the American workers and farmers who support them from grain to glass,” said Chris Swonger, the association’s president.</p>
<p>Several European leaders expressed relief that a deal had been reached, although France appeared to take a harder-line approach.</p>
<p>French Trade Minister Laurent Saint-Martin said in a radio interview Monday that there were good elements in the deal, but France’s position would depend on its technical details.</p>
<p>He also called for officials to turn their attention to services, an area where the U.S. has a trade surplus.</p>
<p>“I don’t want us to stop with what happened yesterday. That would effectively acknowledge that Europe isn’t an economic power,” Saint-Martin said.</p>
<div>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said the agreement averted a trade conflict that would have severely affected Germany’s   <a data-type="link" href="https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/stock-market-today-dow-sp500-nasdaq-07-28-2025/card/for-germany-s-automakers-eu-deal-brings-clarity-on-higher-costs-btFlFgEhgMamvfaspZQz?mod=article_inline">export-oriented economy</a>. “The unity of the European Union and the hard work of the negotiators have paid off,” he wrote on social media on Sunday. </div><p></p>
<p>Italy’s foreign affairs minister, Antonio Tajani, said the deal averts a trade war, adding that Italy would evaluate the details.</p>
<p>Other countries are now seeking a similar degree of certainty. South Korea has deep vulnerabilities with the U.S., as a major exporter of goods already hit with tariffs, such as autos, steel and aluminum, plus other sectors that Trump has threatened, including semiconductors and smartphones. South Korea has floated investments in the U.S. and purchases of American energy, helping with reviving domestic shipbuilding and relaxing import restrictions.</p>
<p>The EU deal on Sunday will be followed by more talks on related issues, with continued pressure from all sides.</p>
<p>“Ultimately, the two sides should advance regulatory cooperation and a shared approach to common geopolitical challenges,” said the American Chamber of Commerce to the EU.</p>
