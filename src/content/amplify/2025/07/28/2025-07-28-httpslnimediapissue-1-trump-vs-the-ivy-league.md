<p>At this point, you might be wondering, “If you’re not Dave, and I’m not Dave, then who’s writing this email?” I’m Chris Vazquez. Some of you might remember me as <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@washingtonpost/video/6981879051405315334?utm_campaign=issue-1-trump-vs-the-ivy-league&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=lni.media">Chris the intern</a>. I unofficially held that title for nearly two years making short videos alongside Dave at The Washington Post.</p>
<p>These days, I’m Chris The Researcher And Writer On Some Of Dave’s Recent Longform Videos. (Still catchy, right?) I’ll also be in your inbox every Thursday evening, giving you more context on the news Dave spotlights in his videos — locally, internationally and everything in between.</p>
<p>I’ll share a few bullet points on four to five stories a week, then pass it off to Dave for some analysis at the end of each email. It’s kinda like an evening edition of The Daily Planet, except it’s an email and Superman doesn’t work here and I’m definitely not secretly Superman, stop asking.</p>

<p>I’d also love to know what you want to see here. Maybe we can share extended replies to video comments worth digging into, or a transcript of Dave explaining the plot of <em>You’ve Got Mail</em> (1998) to me, or other fun things you have in mind. Drop a reply and let me know.</p>
<p>And in the spirit of trying new things, one of Dave’s first videos as an independent journalist went up today. Let’s dig in.</p>

<p>Hi, this is Dave. Not Chris, or JD Vance. I’m typing these words. I promise! Here are my thoughts on Trump’s handling of Columbia.</p>
<p>If you haven’t seen <em>The Apprentice</em> yet, it’s worth a watch. I don’t mean the television show (now available on Amazon Prime), but the biopic that came out last year starring Sebastian Stan and Jeremy Strong. Early on in the film, the fictional Roy Cohn (Strong) introduces his three rules to a young Donald Trump (Stan).</p>
<p>Did that conversation with Cohn and Trump really happen? Probably not. But this playbook is exactly how Trump has approached punishing university students that have protested the genocide in Gaza. In Columbia’s case, it worked. He “won” and they’ve paid up, agreeing to his terms.</p>
<p>It’s why I included the last bit in the video about the Wall Street Journal’s revelation that Attorney General Pam Bondi told Trump he was named in the Epstein files. He’s attempting the same playbook in the Epstein story, with less success. For weeks now, Trump has attempted this playbook following the outrage over his handling of the Epstein files.</p>
<p>Covering Trump for the last decade has been exhausting, and based on these rules, that’s clearly by design. But I’ll keep putting on an extra long tie and covering it because it’s important to stay informed.</p>

<p>We’ll feature more stories next week, the first official week of Local News International — <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DaveJorgenson/featured?utm_campaign=issue-1-trump-vs-the-ivy-league&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=lni.media">which you can subscribe to for free here!</a> And speaking of asking you to do stuff, you should also read our weekly Monday newsletter, where Dave will give you a behind-the-scenes peek at how he and the rest of our team are building Local News International. Plus, you can support our independent journalism by signing up for a paid newsletter subscription.</p>
<p>You’ll get our newsletters for free no matter what, but you could also choose to pay $15 a month at the Local Tier for early access to newsletters and longform videos, as well as access to our inaugural Q&amp;A on Zoom.</p>
<p>For $500 per year at the International Tier, you’ll get those same perks along with more Q&amp;A Zooms, early access to merch, and a private Slack channel with behind-the-scenes chats. You’ll also help us afford to live, which I think is neat.</p>
