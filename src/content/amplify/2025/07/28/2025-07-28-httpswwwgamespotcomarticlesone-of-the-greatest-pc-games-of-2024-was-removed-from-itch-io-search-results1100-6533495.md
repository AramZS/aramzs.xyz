title: One Of The Greatest PC Games Of 2024 Was Removed From Itch.io Search Results
---
<p>Due to pressure from payment processors and right-wing advocacy groups, the marketplaces Itch.io and Steam recently announced that <a data-ref-id="1100-6533423" href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/itch-io-joins-steam-in-recent-push-to-ban-adult-games/1100-6533423/">they would be delisting or de-indexing games that were perceived as "Not Safe For Work."</a> While apparently intended to disrupt the production and marketing of adult-content games, this move has already had a much broader impact: The critically acclaimed horror game Mouthwashing has been de-indexed from Itch.io as part of this sweep.</p>
<p>Martin Halldin, who works on audio and music for Mouthwashing developer Wrong Organ, posted on Bluesky that the title had been de-indexed from Itch.io. Halldin wrote that the game is currently still accessible if you have the link--it hasn't been fully removed yet--but not showing up in search results can still have a devastating impact on indie titles.</p>
<p>After its launch in 2024, Mouthwashing racked up extensive acclaim and a number of end-of-year accolades. Its Steam reviews are sitting at Overwhelmingly Positive with over 28,000 user reviews submitted--a remarkable total for a game created by a small and previously unknown team. It is a psychological horror game, and the developer itself even warns on the product page that Mouthwashing contains "extreme violence, gore, mutilation and worse on PSX-style characters."</p>
<p>Despite its obviously mature content and themes, Mouthwashing does not contain pornography and is not sexually explicit--<a data-ref-id="1100-6533423" href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/itch-io-joins-steam-in-recent-push-to-ban-adult-games/1100-6533423/">which was ostensibly the main target of the campaign organized by advocacy group Collective Shout.</a> Despite the group's declared focus on preventing the depiction of "sexual abuse" in games, the campaign's impact has been to seemingly induce a much broader push to "de-risk" from <em>all </em>adult content, no matter its subject. As a result, horror games and other titles depicting subjects far afield from anything sexual have also been affected.</p>
<p>Developers and fans of affected games have been attempting <a data-target="true" href="https://bsky.app/profile/sjklapecki.itch.io/post/3luohh5kf4s2d">to organize counter-pressure</a> to encourage payment processors to reverse their stance. Civil liberties NGOs like the ACLU have already joined the fight, too; the ACLU, for instance, <a data-target="true" href="https://action.aclu.org/petition/mastercard-sex-work-work-end-your-unjust-policy">is currently soliciting signatures for a petition against Mastercard</a>.</p>
