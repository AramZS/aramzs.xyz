title: 'July Green Coffee Outlook: A Bigger Threat to Coffee Prices than Frost'
---
<h2>The pause on reciprocal tariffs has ended, bringing new anxieties around coffee prices.</h2>
<p>With the threat of a frost in <a href="https://library.sweetmarias.com/glossary/brazil/">Brazil</a> nearly in the rearview mirror comes a renewed uncertainty of additional costs from tariffs. The 90 day pause on reciprocal tariffs expired on July 9, opening the door for the President to increase tariff amounts for specific countries. This is in addition to the 10% tariff currently applied to all imported goods, including coffee.</p>
<p>So far only 14 countries have been singled out for reciprocal tariffs. However, we’re already seen that this number can change rather quickly. Just this week, an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/10/trump-lula-tariffs-brazil-explainer">additional 50% tariff</a> on all goods from Brazil was threatened. While still just a threat, this would bring the total tax on Brazilian imports to 60%, the highest reciprocal tariff yet.</p>
<p>The tariffs are supposed to be about balancing trade deficits. Never mind the fact that with Brazil we have a trade <em>surplus</em>. Brazil is the world’s largest supplier of coffee (the US being the largest buyer), and any possible disruption of that supply chain – price hikes included – will certainly impact coffee prices globally. One of the biggest drivers of coffee market volatility is the threat of frost damage to Brazilian coffee crops, but we may have found a bigger specter in the threat of tariffs.</p>

<p>The problem with all of this, is that it’s not the countries who pay the tax – it’s us. At the current rate of 10%, a $150,000 container of Brazilian coffee sees about a $14,000 tariff added on top. A 60% tariff would increase that amount to a whopping $80,000. To a small business, both numbers are quite painful.</p>
<p>Tom recently <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DLBFv2mzpK9/">posted a photo</a> of an “Entry Summary” invoice that we now receive for all our arrivals, showing how these new tariffs are applied. As he pointed out in that post, the added costs are significant ($20,000 in this particular instance), and not something we are able to absorb. We have to pass it along in our prices. Not that there’s ever a <em>good</em> time for tariffs, but this is all happening in a coffee market that’s recently soared to historic levels.</p>
<p>It is what it is, and like everyone else, we will muddle through. We count ourselves lucky to have customers who are willing to muddle through with us. In fact, we’ve received some really thoughtful responses to <a href="https://library.sweetmarias.com/coffee-prices-and-tariffs/">previous missives</a> on the topic, and will continue to talk openly about this, doing our best to keep folks posted on any changes. What happens tomorrow is really anyone’s guess.</p>
<p>You may have noticed a few <a href="https://library.sweetmarias.com/glossary/new-crop/">new crop</a> offers trickling out to the site from <a href="https://www.sweetmarias.com/green-coffee/central-america/guatemala.html">Guatemala</a> and <a href="https://www.sweetmarias.com/green-coffee/central-america/mexico.html">Mexico</a>, but the bulk of shipments from Central America, and <a href="https://library.sweetmarias.com/glossary/abyssinia/">Ethiopia</a> arrive over the next two months. In fact between <a href="https://library.sweetmarias.com/glossary/guatemala/">Guatemala</a>, <a href="https://library.sweetmarias.com/glossary/costa-rica/">Costa Rica</a>, and <a href="https://library.sweetmarias.com/glossary/el-salvador/">El Salvador</a>, we’ve seen four containers last during the past two weeks alone. This includes coffees we buy yearly, like Pulcal, Cabrejo, and La Folie from Guatemala, as well as <a href="https://library.sweetmarias.com/glossary/finca/">Finca</a> Jose, Don Oscar, and Don Mayo from Costa Rica.</p>
<p>Ethiopian arrivals are still about 2 weeks away from landing in Oakland, the first box includes washed and <a href="https://library.sweetmarias.com/glossary/dry-process/">dry process</a> coffees from Hambela Dabaye, Buliye, and Benti Nenka. After <a href="https://library.sweetmarias.com/glossary/cupping/">cupping</a> the pre-shipment samples 2 weeks ago, I can honestly say that the quality from these sites is phenomenal. We hope to have our initial offerings available by the 2nd week of August.</p>

<p>Scroll through the Upcoming Coffees lists below for an updated schedule of coffees rolling out in July/August, including quite a few from these first arrivals. In response to requests for more details about when coffees will be available, we’ve added a new column with the projected “Launch Week”. While it’s a good estimate of when things will launch, please keep in mind that we may occasionally push back the schedule due to issues outside our control. Whatever the case, hopefully this guesstimate helps folks plan ahead!</p>
<p>One last thing to note is that you’ll see quite a few Central American coffees in our “Incoming Coffees” list with a status of “ARRIVED”. This means the container is in Oakland, but not yet in our possession. It generally takes a couple of weeks for incoming shipments to be physically moved to the offsite <a href="https://library.sweetmarias.com/glossary/storage/">storage</a> facility we use. Once they are transferred, they will be removed from our “Incoming” list. On that note, just because a coffee’s disappeared – like some of the Guatemala’s and Costa Rica’s have from the May Outlook – doesn’t mean you missed them. It means they are now in our possession and you should see them on our launch schedule shortly.</p>

<p><strong><em>Please keep in mind that names may change when we list the coffee on our website. Location status of “TBD” are also a bit of a wild card, as logistical disruptions are out of our control! You also may notice some of the coffees from last month’s list have disappeared. Don’t worry, you probably haven’t missed them. They are now in our possession and should be on our launch schedule soon. Thanks for your patience!</em></strong></p>
