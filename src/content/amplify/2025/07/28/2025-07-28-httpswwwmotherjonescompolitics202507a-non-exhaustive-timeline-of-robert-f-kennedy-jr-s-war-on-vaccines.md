<p>Long before he became secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services under President Trump, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was laying the groundwork for his war on vaccines. As the head of the anti-vaccine nonprofit Children’s Health Defense, Kennedy amplified once-fringe conspiracies about vaccine safety and joined a larger crusade against the <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/07/the-plot-against-vaccines/">Vaccine Injury Compensation Program</a>, the government initiative that was established in the 1980s by Congress to compensate people who were able to prove a likely vaccine injury. In his current leadership role, Kennedy has leveraged political power, transforming conspiracy theories into action—and reshaping American vaccine policy in just a few short months.</p>

<p><strong>January 10, 2017:</strong> Before Trump’s first term, Kennedy claims he was asked to chair a <a href="https://www.politico.com/blogs/donald-trump-administration/2017/01/trump-meets-robert-f-kennedy-jr-233417">commission</a> on “vaccine safety.” It <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/21/trump-vaccination-safety-commission-robert-kennedy-autism">never comes to pass</a>.</p>
<p><strong>June 29, 2021:</strong> A new edition of <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Vaccine-Court-Americas-Compensation-Program/dp/1510758372">The Vaccine Court: The Dark Truth of America’s Vaccine Injury Compensation Program</a></em> has a foreword by Kennedy.</p>
<p><strong>May 9, 2022:</strong> Kennedy <a href="https://x.com/RobertKennedyJr/status/1523730657511636993">tweets</a> that “the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program protects government agencies and corporations, not vaccine-injured children.”</p>
<p><strong>August 23, 2024:</strong> Kennedy <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/rfk-jr-drops-out-presidential-race/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">suspends</a> campaign and backs Trump, pledging to work on “the chronic disease epidemic” with him.</p>
<p><strong>September 5, 2024:</strong> Kennedy debuts the “Make America Healthy Again” slogan in a <em>Wall Street Journal</em> <a href="https://archive.is/K4E77">op-ed</a>, attracting a new cohort to Trump’s fan base.</p>
<p><strong>November 14, 2024:</strong> Trump <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113483366471340943">nominates</a> Kennedy to serve as Health and Human Services secretary.</p>
<p><strong>January 29–30, 2025:</strong> During his Senate <a href="https://www.finance.senate.gov/hearings/hearingto-consider-the-nomination-of-robert-f-kennedy-jr-of-california-to-be-secretary-of-health-and-human-services">confirmation</a> <a href="https://www.help.senate.gov/hearings/nomination-of-robert-f-kennedy-jr-to-serve-as-secretary-of-health-and-human-services">hearings</a>, Kennedy says he’ll support the current vaccine schedule, insisting he just wants “good science.” He is confirmed after Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), a doctor who heads the health committee, <a href="https://www.cassidy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cassidy-delivers-floor-speech-in-support-of-rfk-jr-to-be-hhs-secretary/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">says</a> he anticipates having “an unprecedentedly close collaborative working relationship” with Kennedy.</p>
<p><strong>February 20, 2025:</strong> Kennedy <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-cdc-vaccine-advisory-meeting-be-postponed-stat-news-reports-2025-02-20/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">postpones</a> a meeting of the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), thereby delaying recommendations for fall vaccines.</p>
<p><strong>March 2, 2025:</strong> Amid a deadly measles outbreak, Kennedy writes a Fox News <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-measles-outbreak-call-action-all-us">op-ed</a> asserting that “the decision to vaccinate is a personal one.” He later <a href="https://www.uchealth.org/today/vitamin-a-and-cod-liver-oil-ineffective-against-measles-in-us/">touts</a> unproven treatments for measles, including cod liver oil.</p>
<p><strong>March 25, 2025:</strong> Kennedy <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/03/25/vaccine-skeptic-hhs-rfk-immunization-autism/">hires</a> David Geier to reportedly study the debunked link between vaccines and autism. Geier has been disciplined for practicing medicine without a license and had papers on autism claims <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/03/27/david-geier-retractions-autism-vaccines-rfk-hhs-cdc/#more-131521">retracted</a>.</p>
<p><strong>June 6, 2025: </strong>HHS pays $150,000 to an Arizona <a href="https://www.usaspending.gov/award/CONT_AWD_75P00125P00036_7570_-NONE-_-NONE-">law firm</a> for “expertise” on the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program; a partner frequently represents people suing vaccine makers.</p>
<p><strong>June 9, 2025:</strong> Kennedy <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/hhs-restore-public-trust-vaccines-acip.html">fires</a> all 17 members of ACIP and then <a href="https://apnews.com/article/cdc-acip-vaccine-committee-9f58e1f004075b081718ff078de88d76">appoints</a> eight new members, three of whom have a history of anti-vax activism. Cassidy <a href="https://x.com/senbillcassidy/status/1937283186758680766?s=46">decries</a> the move.</p>
<p><strong>June 16, 2025: </strong>CDC expert <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/18/health/havers-cdc-vaccines-kennedy.html">Fiona Havers</a> quits over Kennedy’s meddling in vaccination standards: “If it isn’t stopped and some of this isn’t reversed, like, immediately, a lot of Americans are going to die.”</p>
<p><strong>June 23, 2025: </strong>Kennedy <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/23/health/cdc-vaccine-meeting-thimerosal-lyn-redwood">appoints</a> Lyn Redwood—who ran the anti-vaccine group that later became Kennedy’s Children’s Health Defense—to the CDC’s Immunization Safety Office. Before she is due to present to ACIP about concerns over thimerosal, an ingredient that anti-vaccine activists have long falsely claimed causes autism, her <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/24/health/cdc-vaccine-adviser-thimerosal-presentation">slides</a>, citing a study that does not exist, are posted publicly. The citation is removed, but after her address, ACIP <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2025/2025-cdcs-advisory-committee-on-immunization-concludes-meeting-with-joint-statement.html">votes</a> to no longer recommend flu vaccines that contain thimerosal.</p>
<p><strong>June 25, 2025:</strong> Kennedy says the United States will <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-stop-financial-support-global-vaccine-alliance-gavi-says-health-secretary-2025-06-25/">stop funding GAVI</a>, a global vaccine alliance. The $1 billion previously pledged, he <a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1937986463510982869">says</a>, will not be delivered until GAVI starts “taking vaccine safety seriously.”</p>
