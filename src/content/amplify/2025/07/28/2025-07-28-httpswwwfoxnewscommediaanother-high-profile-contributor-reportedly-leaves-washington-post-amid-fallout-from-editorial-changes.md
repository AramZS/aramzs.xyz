  Another high profile contributor reportedly leaves the Washington Post amid
  fallout from editorial changes
---
<p>Washington Post columnist Jonathan Capehart has reportedly accepted a buyout and is leaving the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/jeff-bezos">Jeff Bezos</a>-owned paper after nearly two decades.</p>
<p>Capehart, who won a Pulitzer Prize for editorial writing with the New York Daily News in 1999, has served as an editorial writer for the Washington Post for over 18 years. He was a member of the editorial board until 2022, when he left the board over a dispute about an editorial on Georgia’s voting laws. He is leaving the paper after accepting a buyout, <a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-am">Axios reported</a> Monday.</p>
<p>The columnist, who also hosts the MSNBC Show "Weekends with Jonathan Capehart" and provides commentary on the PBS "NewsHour," is the latest high-profile Washington Post editorial contributor to exit the paper.</p>
<p>A glut of writers -- Ann Telnaes, David Shipley, Ruth Marcus, Eugene Robinson and, just earlier this month, Joe Davidson – all departed the beltway paper as concerns mount over the Washington Post’s editorial slant taking a rightward shift following President Trump’s re-election.</p>

<p>Following Trump’s re-election, Washington Post owner and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos announced that the editorial section of the paper <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/jeff-bezos-announces-big-change-washington-post-opinion-page-top-editor-steps-down">would be changing</a> course, prompting then-opinion editor David Shipley to leave.</p>
<p>"We are going to be writing every day in support and defense of two pillars: personal liberties and free markets. We’ll cover other topics too of course, but viewpoints opposing those pillars will be left to be published by others," Bezos posted on X in <a href="https://x.com/JeffBezos/status/1894757287052362088?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1894757287052362088%7Ctwgr%5E3a2304bee984a13a77b6184de3f3daf06a7d15c1%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxnews.com%2Fmedia%2Fjeff-bezos-announces-big-change-washington-post-opinion-page-top-editor-steps-down">Feb 2025</a>.</p>
<p>Bezos’ changes led to a sharp backlash in his newsroom, with staffers telling Fox News Digital earlier this month that <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/washington-post-staff-shellshocked-constant-blows-morale-bosses-seek-buyouts-insider-says">morale has collapsed</a> at the paper. Washington Post Executive Editor Matt Murray announced a buyout program for staffers seeking to leave the paper in May.</p>
<p>"People are shellshocked and keeping their heads down," one Post staffer told <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media">Fox News Digital</a>.</p>
<p>Washington Post publisher and CEO Will Lewis sent a memo to staff encouraging those who took issue with the paper’s new editorial direction to take the buyouts.</p>

<p>"I understand and respect, however, that our chosen path is not for everyone, that’s exactly why we introduced the voluntary separation program. As we continue in this new direction, I want to ask those who do not feel aligned with the company’s plan to reflect on that," Lewis wrote in the memo.</p>
<p>Davidson, a post contributor who authored the Post's "Federal Insider" column for 17 years, announced he was quitting the paper in a Facebook post titled "Quitting The Washington Post -- or did it quit me?" He said that he decided to exit the paper after having a column rejected for being "too opinionated."</p>
<p>Capehart’s relationship with the Washington Post has been increasingly acrimonious. In his recent memoir, "Yet Here I Am: Lessons from a Black Man's Search for Home," the former columnist <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/washington-post-columnist-trashes-colleagues-says-editor-robbed-him-his-humanity-memoir-report">trashed many of his colleagues</a> at The Post’s editorial board. He accused Washington Post editorial board member Karen Tumulty of "robbing me of my humanity" in a disagreement over language used in an op-ed.</p>

<p>The former Washington Post contributor has a history of vicious anti-Trump criticism. At one point, he said that <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/jonathan-capehart-maga-more-worrisome-than-isis-taliban">MAGA was far more "worrisome"</a> for the country than any foreign threat America could face in a 2021 segment on PBS NewsHour.</p>
<p>Fox News Digital reached out to the Washington Post and Capehart for comment.</p>
