<p>Alibaba announced plans to release a pair of smart glasses powered by its AI models. The Quark AI Glasses are Alibaba’s first foray into the smart glasses product category.</p>
<p>Alibaba</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/BABA/">Alibaba</a> on Monday unveiled a pair of smart glasses powered by its artificial intelligence models, marking the Chinese firm’s first foray into the product category.</p>
<p>The e-commerce giant said the Quark AI Glasses will be launched in China by the end of 2025 with hardware powered by the firm’s Qwen large language model and its advanced <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/13/alibaba-launches-new-version-of-ai-assistant-tool-as-competition-heats-up.html">AI assistant called Quark</a>.</p>
<p>The Hangzhou, headquartered company is one of the leaders in China’s AI space, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/27/alibaba-launches-open-source-ai-model-for-cost-effective-ai-agents.html">aggressively launching new models</a> with capabilities that compete with Western counterparts like OpenAI.</p>
<p>Many tech companies see wearables, specifically glasses, as the next frontier in computing alongside the smartphone. Quark, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/13/alibaba-launches-new-version-of-ai-assistant-tool-as-competition-heats-up.html">which was updated this year</a>, is currently available as an app in China. Alibaba is stepping into the hardware game as a way to distribute the app more widely.</p>
<p>The Quark AI Glasses are Alibaba’s answer to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/09/shares-of-ray-ban-maker-essilorluxottica-jump-on-reported-meta-stake.html">Meta’s smart glasses</a> that were designed in collaboration with Ray-Ban. The Chinese tech giant will also now compete with Chinese consumer electronics player <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/1810-HK/">Xiaomi</a> who this year <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/26/chinas-xiaomi-undercuts-tesla-with-yet-another-cheaper-car.html">released its own AI glasses</a>.</p>

<p>Alibaba said its glasses will support hands-free calling, music streaming, real-time language translation, and meeting transcription. The glasses also feature a built-in camera.</p>
<p>Alibaba owns a range of different services in China from mapping to an online travel agent. Its affiliate company Ant Group also runs the widely-used Alipay mobile service. Alibaba said users will be able to use a navigation service via the glasses, pay with Alipay and compare prices on Taobao, its China e-commerce platform.</p>
<p>The firm has yet to release other details such as the price and technical specifications.</p>
