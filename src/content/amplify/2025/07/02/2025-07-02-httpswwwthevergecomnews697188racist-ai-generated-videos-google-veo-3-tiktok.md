  These short videos show hateful stereotypes about Black people and other
  groups. It is unclear if TikTok or Google are taking action to stop them.

<p>Racist videos that appear to be created with Google’s AI video generation tool Veo 3 have raked in millions of views across TikTok, <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/tiktok/racist-ai-generated-videos-are-newest-slop-garnering-millions-views-tiktok">according to findings</a> from the nonprofit media watchdog Media Matters. The AI-generated videos uncovered by the organization are filled with racist tropes, many of which target Black people.</p>
<p>Media Matters determined that the videos — one of which received 14.2 million views — were generated with Google Veo 3 because of the “Veo” watermark in the corner of the clips. Some users also listed hashtags, captions, or usernames pertaining to Veo 3 or AI, according to Media Matters. Each clip found by the organization lasted just eight seconds, or was “composed of multiple clips each lasting no more than 8 seconds,” which tracks with Veo 3’s eight-second limit.</p>
<p>Veo 3, launched by Google in May, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/673719/google-veo-3-ai-video-audio-sound-effects">allows users to generate</a> AI video clips and audio with just a text prompt. <a href="https://deepmind.google/models/veo/">On its website</a>, Google says it will “block harmful requests and results.” <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/safety/en/countering-hate">TikTok’s rules</a> similarly state that “hate speech and hateful behavior has no place on TikTok,” and that the platform “will not recommend content that contains negative stereotypes about a person or group with a protected attribute.”</p>
<p><em>The Verge</em> found some of the videos highlighted by Media Matters were also on YouTube but with fewer views, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ai-videos-black-women-depicted-as-primates-viral/">while <em>Wired </em>also discovered similar,</a> racist AI-generated videos on Instagram. Other videos found by Media Matters contain anti-Semitic content and racist depictions of immigrants and Asian people.</p>
<p>It’s not clear whether TikTok has removed the videos flagged by Media Matters or if Google is aware of Veo 3’s harmful outputs. Neither Google nor TikTok immediately responded to <em>The Verge</em>’s request for comment.</p>
