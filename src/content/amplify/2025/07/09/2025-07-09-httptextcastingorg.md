  Textcasting is described as similar to podcasting but for text. The document
  emphasizes the importance of not hindering the ability to connect with
  services that support the full specifications, as past conflicts arose when
  certain platforms had incompatible requirements. The current landscape lacks
  dominant feed readers or microblogging sites, creating an opportunity for new
  entrants to compete based on compatibility. Dave Winer, known for creating
  blogging, feeds, and podcasting, highlights the potential for textcasting to
  be even bigger than podcasting, with improved networks and software
  capabilities.

<p>Like podcasting, for text.</p>
<ul> <li> <ul> <li>To support it you don't have to support every feature. But you shouldn't make it impossible to peer with a service that supports the full spec. For example, there was a time when the leading feed reader app required posts to have titles, and the leading microblogging site said they couldn't have them. That meant not only didn't they share data, they couldn't.<a href="http://textcasting.org/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email#1670873252000">#</a></li> <li>We're at a good moment where there is no dominant feed reader or microblogging site. It's a fluid situation. New entrants could compete on the basis of how compatible they are with their competitors. The users would like to hear about that. It's a good time to get in at the beginning of something that could be even bigger than podcasting, for text. <a href="http://textcasting.org/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email#1670873343000">#</a></li> <li>I am Dave Winer, I created blogging, feeds and podcasting. I did it once, I'd like to do it again, only better this time because we know more, the networks are much more capable than they were twenty years ago, and so is the software. And we have the experience with pitfalls we will avoid this time, hopefully.<a href="http://textcasting.org/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email#1670873429000">#</a></li> </ul> </li> </ul>
