  Most ICE detainees at Butler County Jail have no criminal convictions besides
  immigration violations. Many convictions are for minor, nonviolent offenses
  like traffic violations and DUIs. ICE arrests in Greater Cincinnati are higher
  than in other parts of Ohio, with many detainees held for shorter times.

title: 7 in 10 ICE detainees at Butler County Jail have no criminal convictions

<ul><li>Over one-third of ICE detainees at Butler County Jail had no criminal record besides an immigration violation.</li><li>Most convictions of ICE detainees at the jail were for nonviolent crimes, like traffic offenses and DUIs.</li><li>ICE arrests in Greater Cincinnati are higher than the rest of Ohio, with about 35% of arrests occurring in the area.</li></ul>
<p>Most people detained by ICE at the <a data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" href="https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/2025/06/09/people-protest-ice-butler-county-jail-ohio/84115250007/">Butler County Jail</a> had no criminal record besides an immigration violation, an Enquirer review of ICE and jail data found.</p>
<p>The Enquirer obtained data from the Butler County Jail through a public records request, and also reviewed ICE data obtained by the <a data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" href="https://deportationdata.org/">Deportation Data Project</a>, a group that collects and publishes U.S. immigration data.</p>
<p><a data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" href="https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/politics/2025/06/19/teachers-union-opposes-deportation-of-students/84258203007/">Butler County</a> Sheriff Richard Jones signed a contract with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in February, and the jail began detaining people for the agency, for a fee, in March. The Enquirer requested jail data from Jan. 20, when President Donald Trump entered office, to June 8. Between that time period, the jail detained over 770 people for ICE.</p>
<p>Less than one-third of ICE detainees at the jail had a criminal conviction, and most were for nonviolent crimes, like traffic offenses and DUIs, ICE data showed.</p>
<p>Days after he was elected, Trump said his mass deportation plan would "rescue" cities and towns from <a data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-confirms-plan-declare-national-emergency-military-mass/story?id=115963448">"vicious and bloodthirsty criminals."</a></p>
<p>U.S. Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin echoed that in an email to The Enquirer, and said ICE is targeting criminals "who pose a threat to our communities."</p>
<p>"The media continues to peddle this FALSE narrative that ICE is not targeting criminal illegal aliens," she wrote. "The official data tells the true story: 70% of ICE arrests were criminal illegal aliens with convictions or pending charges."</p>
<p>But that's not the case at Butler County Jail, where 57% of people detained either had a conviction or pending criminal charges.</p>
<p>Immigration violations are considered a civil, not criminal, issue. An immigration violation can be overstaying a visa or working without permission, according to the <a data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" href="https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/field_document/FINAL_criminalizing_undocumented_immigrants_issue_brief_PUBLIC_VERSION.pdf">American Civil Liberties Union</a>.</p>
<p>Entering or reentering the United States illegally, though, is considered a crime.</p>
<h2>Traffic, DUIs are top convictions for Butler jail ICE detainees</h2>
<p>The Butler County Jail in Hamilton, Ohio holds ICE detainees from across the state and country.</p>
<p>Around 43% of detainees were listed by ICE as having an immigration violation, called "other immigration violators," according to ICE data from the Deportation Data Project.</p>
<p>Roughly 28% of detainees had pending criminal charges. Approximately 29% had a conviction, which means 71% of detainees did not.</p>
<p>Detainees without a U.S. criminal record could still face charges or convictions abroad, Homeland Security spokesperson McLaughlin said.</p>
<p>ICE records detainees' "most serious conviction." Most of these convictions were for nonviolent crimes.</p>
<p>The Enquirer used the FBI's definition of violent crime ‒ which includes murder, nonnegligent manslaughter, rape, robbery and aggravated assault ‒ and also included domestic violence, hit-and-run and sex offenses as violent crimes.</p>
<p>All other convictions, such as drug-related crimes, theft, or traffic violations, were logged as nonviolent.</p>
<p>The most common convictions overall were for DUIs, traffic offenses and disorderly conduct. The most common violent conviction was for domestic violence, which 11 detainees were convicted of.</p>
<h2>Almost two-thirds of Cincinnati ICE arrestees had no convictions</h2>
<p>The Enquirer reviewed ICE arrest data for the state of Ohio and for an area around Cincinnati and the Butler County Jail.</p>
<p>The agency didn't specify what cities and counties were included in that data.</p>
<p>Most people arrested by ICE in Ohio had pending criminal charges or a conviction, ICE data shows. But a slightly larger number of people arrested by ICE in those local areas only had immigration violations.</p>
<p>Statewide, ICE data showed roughly 72% of people arrested were either convicted criminals or were facing pending charges. The data did not say what the convictions were for.</p>
<p>Just under 30% of people had only an immigration violation.</p>
<p>However, in the local areas, around 35% were listed as "other immigrant violators."</p>
<p>That was the case for <a data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" href="https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/politics/2025/06/18/emerson-colidnres-deported-honduras/84258167007/">19-year-old Emerson Colindres</a>, who was arrested during a check-in with ICE at the agency's Blue Ash office. Colindres lacked legal status after his family's asylum application was denied, but he had no criminal history.</p>
<p>Around 28% of people arrested in the local areas the Enquirer reviewed had pending charges, and 37% had a conviction, according to ICE.</p>
<h2>Who is detained at the Butler County Jail?</h2>
<p>The Enquirer obtained information about ICE detainees booked at the Butler County Jail between Jan. 20 and June 8 via a public records request. Here are some big takeaways:</p>
<p>People detained at the jail came from 51 countries, according to the jail. Most detainees were men, and the most common age was between 30 and 40 years old.</p>
<p>The largest number of detainees resided in Hamilton, a city north of Cincinnati where 63% of votes went for Trump in 2024. Hamilton is where the Butler County Jail is located.</p>
<p>A small portion of Hamilton residents, 7%, are foreign-born, but the majority of those residents are not U.S. citizens, according to <a data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" href="https://data.census.gov/profile/Hamilton_city,_Butler_County,_Ohio?g=060XX00US3901733012#populations-and-people">Census data</a>.</p>
<p>Hamilton hosts a Hispanic Heritage Festival, and roughly 10% of residents are Hispanic, according to <a data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" href="https://data.census.gov/profile/Hamilton_city,_Butler_County,_Ohio?g=060XX00US3901733012#race-and-ethnicity">Census data</a>.</p>
<h2>ICE detentions at the jail are up, and could increase</h2>
<p>Detentions at the Butler jail were up in June, and could continue to increase now that some <a data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" href="https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/politics/2025/06/26/butler-county-ohio-sheriffs-deputies-make-ice-arrests/84352241007/">sheriff's deputies are authorized to make immigration arrests</a>.</p>
<p>Sheriff Jones previously told The Enquirer he expects deputies' new arresting power will lead to more ICE arrests in the county.</p>
<p>ICE detainees are held at four jails in Greater Cincinnati: in Butler County, Ohio and in Boone, Campbell and Kenton counties in Kentucky. The Enquirer's review of ICE data showed <a data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" href="https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/politics/2025/06/30/ohio-ice-detainees-cleveland-immigration-court/84355175007/">immigration proceedings</a> at all four jails are happening much faster.</p>
<p>In January, detainees were held at the jails, on average, for 40 days before being transferred, released or deported. In May, people were detained, on average, for less than two weeks.</p>
