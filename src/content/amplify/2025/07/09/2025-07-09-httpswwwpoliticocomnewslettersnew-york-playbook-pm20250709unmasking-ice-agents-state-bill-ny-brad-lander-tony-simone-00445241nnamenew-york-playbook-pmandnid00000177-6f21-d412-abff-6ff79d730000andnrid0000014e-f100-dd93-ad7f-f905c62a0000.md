<h1>Unmasking ICE agents</h1>
<p>By <a href="https://www.politico.com/staff/jason-beeferman">JASON BEEFERMAN</a></p>

<p><b>SHOW YOUR FACE:</b> New York Democrats are itching to ban masks again.</p>
<p>A group of state lawmakers and city officials want to bar ICE agents from wearing face coverings during immigration raids. And Mayor Eric Adams is pushing for a citywide regulation on masks that targets menacing protesters.</p>
<p>The two pushes — one from a mayor aligned with President Donald Trump and another from a throng of Democrats who abhor him — are playing out just months after Gov. Kathy Hochul signed a state spending plan that included new mask-wearing restrictions, which were significantly weakened during budget negotiations.</p>
<p>Videos of masked ICE agents rounding up people they believe to be undocumented have gone viral, and the agency says the use of masks ensures their officers’ safety from criminals who may target them. On Friday, ICE agents were allegedly <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/08/texas-ice-agents-ambush">ambushed by 10 people</a> who shot at them.</p>
<p>The agency has been under pressure to detain more undocumented immigrants as the Trump administration set an <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/07/05/trump-got-170-billion-for-immigration-now-he-has-to-enact-it-00439785?mc_cid=ef626eef83&amp;mc_eid=98ccc685a9">unprecedented goal of 1 million deportations</a> a year, leading to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM">more aggressive tactics</a> that critics say are extreme.</p>
<p>City Comptroller Brad Lander, Borough President Mark Levine and Assemblymembers Tony Simone, Grace Lee and Jo Anne Simon were in downtown Manhattan today lobbying for a bill that restricts law enforcement from wearing masks.</p>
<p>The bill, which will be introduced by Simone, was inspired by a similar state law proposed in California. It’s called the “MELT Act” and would require “all law enforcement” — not just ICE — to wear clear identification with names and badge numbers.</p>
<p>“When the enforcement agents mask themselves and don’t wear badges — so you have no idea who they are, what agency they work for, what authority they operate under — then it becomes impossible to hold them accountable for their actions,” said Lander, who spoke outside the federal courthouse where he was arrested last month by ICE agents while escorting an immigrant. (ICE claims Lander was arrested because he “assaulted our brave law enforcement,” though <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gwynnefitz.bsky.social/post/3lrsvgpbt3k2v">video of the incident</a> does <a href="https://washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/06/19/brad-lander-ice-assault-masking">not support that claim</a>.)</p>
<p>Lander said agents wear masks “for the purpose of striking fear into asylum seekers and immigrants in the hope that they will be terrorized by masked gangs who seek to grab and abduct them.”</p>
<p>In a statement, ICE responded to Lander and the proposed legislation.</p>
<p>“Our agents are being assaulted by rioters with rocks and Molotov cocktails thrown at them and shot at, these sanctuary politicians must tone down their rhetoric,” said Tricia McLaughlin, an assistant secretary at the Department of Homeland Security. “This despicable rhetoric about our brave law enforcement has contributed to a 700 percent increase in assaults against them.</p>
<p>“Additionally, Comptroller Lander has clearly never been on an ICE operation because he would see our officers verbally identify themselves, wear vests that say ICE/ERO or Homeland Security, and are flanked by vehicles that also say the name of the department. When our heroic law enforcement officers conduct operations, they clearly identify themselves as law enforcement. These arguments are getting a little desperate.”</p>
<p>The legislation includes broad exceptions for medical masks “to prevent the transmission of airborne diseases” and “masks that protect officers from the cold.” Law enforcement would be allowed to don masks in special circumstances like narcotics operations or SWAT raids, Simone said.</p>
<p>Hochul initially wanted to make it a crime for New Yorkers to wear masks with the intent to menace and harass others — <a href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/video-audio-photos-rush-transcript-governor-hochul-announces-28-percent-decline-shootings-and">an idea inspired</a> by a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/05/new-yorks-push-to-restrict-masks-is-dividing-democrats-00274350">viral video</a> of masked pro-Palestinian protesters harassing subway riders.</p>
<p>But the legislation was defanged after <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/05/new-yorks-push-to-restrict-masks-is-dividing-democrats-00274350">opposition from left-leaning lawmakers</a> and the Black, Puerto Rican, Hispanic &amp; Asian Legislative Caucus. The law that passed only allows for individuals to be charged with wearing a mask if it was used to conceal their identity in the commission of a separate crime.</p>
<p>The mask restrictions had been one of Hochul’s budget priorities and allowed her to stake out a tough-on-crime position while appealing to pro-Israel New Yorkers rattled by masked pro-Palestinian protesters on college campuses.</p>
<p>In the coming weeks, Adams is now expected to introduce legislation in the City Council that aims to pick up where Hochul’s mask proposal fell flat.</p>
<p>“Mayor Adams has been clear that while we will always protect everyone’s right to peacefully protest, cowards who hide behind masks to harass and threaten others are unacceptable and should be illegal once again,” Adams’ spokesperson Kayla Mamelak Altus said in a statement.</p>
<p>“Mayor Adams also called on the state to pass legislation that would make this illegal — just as it was prior to the COVID-19 pandemic — and while some changes were made, he has said that the legislation does not go far enough. We are examining ways to work with the City Council to pass further legislation on the local level.” — <b><i>Jason Beeferman</i></b></p>
<h2>From the Capitol</h2>
<p><b>JESS ON JESS:</b> Assemblymember Jessica González-Rojas’ “phone’s been ringing off the hook” about a potential primary challenge to state Sen. Jessica Ramos, and she’s “taking this all into consideration.”</p>
<p>Left-leaning Democrats were furious at Ramos for endorsing Andrew Cuomo in the mayoral primary, with many seeing it as a betrayal of the progressive movement that helped her unseat former state Sen. Jose Peralta in 2018. Peralta was a member of the breakaway Independent Democratic Conference, which often aligned with Republican lawmakers.</p>
<p>González-Rojas, a Democrat who reps western Queens, was speaking <a href="https://soundcloud.com/gotham-gazette-max-murphy/latino-voters-nyc-mayor-mamdani-gonzalez-rojas-valentin">on the Max Politics podcast</a> Tuesday.</p>
<p>“A lot of conversations are happening, no decisions are made,” said González-Rojas, who endorsed both Zohran Mamdani and Brad Lander in the primary. She said she’ll have to make a decision this year, ahead of what would be a June 2026 primary.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mamdani supporters are dreaming of backing primary challengers against Congress members like Hakeem Jeffries, Ritchie Torres, Jerry Nadler, Dan Goldman and Yvette Clarke, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/09/politics/hakeem-jeffries-zohran-mamdani-democrats-primaries?">CNN reported</a>, and Democratic City Council Member Justin Brannan is weighing a run against Republican Rep. Nicole Malliotakis.</p>
<p>Brannan’s longtime aide Chris McCreight is also planning a 2026 rematch after losing to GOP Assemblymember Alec Brook-Krasny last year, <a href="https://www.cityandstateny.com/politics/2025/07/take-two-southern-brooklyn-chris-mccreight-running-assembly-again/406603/?oref=csny-homepage-river">City &amp; State reports.</a> — <b><i>Jeff Coltin</i></b></p>
<p><b>ALBANY’S OUTSIDE INCOME: </b>At least 23 members of the state Legislature will be forced to retire from either their public or private jobs if a Republican lawsuit challenging new outside income rules is unsuccessful.</p>
<p>They’re part of a group of 54 state legislators who earned outside income last year, according to financial disclosure forms recently posted by the Commission on Ethics and Lobbying in Government.</p>
<p>Lawmakers holding private sector jobs has been one of the most contentious issues in the Capitol for decades. While some legislators have argued the jobs are an essential part of maintaining a government whose officials understand regular people’s struggles, they’ve been at the center of a long list of scandals that have brought down lawmakers like former Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver.</p>
<p>The side gigs now face an uncertain future. Legislators imposed a cap of $35,000 on outside earnings as part of a 2022 deal to raise their state salaries. Republicans challenged that cap as part of what is turning into a multiyear legal battle, and the new rules are currently on stay pending appellate court arguments.</p>
<p>A total of 30 of the 62 Republicans in the state Legislature who served in 2024 and were still in office to file financial disclosure forms this spring reported making at least some outside income last year. That compares with only 24 of the 124 Democrats. Of the 23 legislators who definitely made more than $35,000 from these jobs and would be affected by the new rules, there were 17 Republicans and six Democrats.</p>
<p>A failure to permanently block the new law in the courts raises the possibility of a GOP exodus from Albany or many members being forced to give up lucrative side gigs.</p>
<p>The highest-earning legislator in 2024 earned over a half-million dollars in outside income.</p>

<h2>FROM THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL</h2>
<p><b>POLL ALERT: </b>Mamdani holds a 10-point lead over Cuomo in the general election for New York City mayor, while Adams trails in fourth place behind Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa, according to a new Slingshot Strategies poll, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/07/09/zohran-mamdani-leads-general-election-poll-00443469">POLITICO reports.</a></p>
<p>Mamdani gets support from 35 percent of registered voters, followed by Cuomo with 25, Sliwa with 14, Adams at 11 and attorney Jim Walden at 1 percent. Thirteen percent of respondents said they weren’t sure, while 1 percent picked another candidate.</p>
<p>The survey of 1,036 registered New York City voters was conducted between July 2-6 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.2 percentage points.</p>
<p>It comes as Cuomo weighs whether to mount a serious campaign on his independent “Fight and Deliver” line — and while the former governor and the current mayor publicly bicker and <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/07/07/game-of-chicken-eric-adams-cuomo-want-each-other-out-of-nyc-mayoral-race-00441398">call on the other one to drop out</a> in order to best consolidate opposition to Mamdani.</p>
<p>Adams in particular is in a bad spot. His net approval rating is at -34, with 28 percent of respondents expressing a favorable view and 62 percent unfavorable. By comparison, Mamdani is at +4 and Cuomo is at -2.</p>
<p>Adams trails Mamdani among every single subset of voters — including Black voters — except one: Republicans, where Adams picks up 26 percent to Mamdani’s 7 percent. Sliwa leads among Republicans however, with 43 percent, while Cuomo gets 16 percent. — <b><i>Jeff Coltin</i></b></p>
