  This post shows how WordPress content can appear on Mastodon using a bridge
  created by Automattic. It supports web features like styling, links, and
  editing, without character limits. This approach helps keep the web open and
  easy for developers by using RSS alongside ActivityPub.

title: Example of a WordPress post in Mastodon
---
<p>This is a <a href="https://daveverse.org/2025/07/09/example-of-a-wordpress-post-in-mastodon/">post</a> I wrote in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordPress">WordPress</a>.</p>
<p>You can also <a href="https://mastodon.social/@scripting@daveverse.org/114823624237979477">read it</a> in Mastodon, via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActivityPub">ActivityPub</a>, and a bridge that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automattic">Automattic</a> created to adapt WordPress posts to the language of ActivityPub.</p>
<p>Here are some of the features that are supported:</p>
<ul> <li> <p>This post has a title (it's optional).</p> </li> <li> <p>Simple styling: <strong>bold</strong>, <em>italic</em>, numbered lists (see below), bulleted lists, subheads. </p> </li> <li> <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink">Hyperlinks</a>, the defining feature of the web, omitted from all twitter-like products, e.g. Bluesky, Mastodon, Threads, Twitter.</p> </li> <li> <p>The posts are editable, if I make a change to the WordPress post, that change is quickly reflected in the ActivityPub version. </p> </li> <li> <p>This post is much longer than the typical Mastodon post, illustrating the lack of a character limit.</p> </li> </ul>
<p>A numbered list, all the continents of the world, in alphabetic order:</p>
<ol> <li>Africa</li> <li>Antarctica</li> <li>Asia</li> <li>Australia</li> <li>Europe</li> <li>North America</li> <li>South America</li> </ol>
<h3>Discussion</h3>
<p>What's remarkable about this feature list is that it's basically the features of the web and the features of RSS, which are also the features of WordPress. These are also the basic features I call for twitter-like services to support in the <a href="https://textcasting.org/">textcasting</a> spec (2022).</p>
<p>By opening this door to developers, easily and quickly, via RSS, we implement the "open" part of it. Until that happens, it's effectively out of reach to developers. If to get into this club you have to support ActivityPub, that's too high a barrier of entry, as we have seen. ActivityPub should be supported well, once, and then accessible via the simplicity of RSS.</p>
