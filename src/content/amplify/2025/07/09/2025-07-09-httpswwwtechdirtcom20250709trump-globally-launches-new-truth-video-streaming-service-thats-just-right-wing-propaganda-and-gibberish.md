  Trump launched Truth+, a streaming service that mostly shows right-wing
  propaganda and fake news channels. Many news outlets reported the launch
  without noting the service’s falsehoods or Trump’s attacks on real journalism.
  This new platform is part of a larger effort to replace honest news with
  biased, misleading content.

  Trump Globally Launches New Truth+ ‘Video Streaming Service’ That’s Just Right
  Wing Propaganda And Gibberish
---
<h3>from the <i>fill-your-head-with-pudding-and-hate</i> dept</h3>
<p>Trump recently launched a “wireless phone service,” which as <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2025/06/17/the-trump-org-sort-of-launches-a-new-half-assed-wireless-phone-company-trump-mobile/">we mentioned</a>, isn’t so much a real phone service as it is a quick licensing agreement and a lazy rebranding of other services. He’s also exploiting the presidency by launching a vast array of new, clumsily branded Trump home goods, including a new <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jun/18/why-is-there-a-maga-branded-instant-pot-because-capitalism-never-sleeps">Trump-branded Instantpot</a>. If you’re into that sort of thing.</p>
<p>The Trump empire also <a href="https://www.mediaite.com/media/trumps-media-company-partners-with-newsmax-for-new-streaming-platform/">recently announced</a> they were globally launching Truth+, the Trump regime’s video streaming propaganda service. Here too, the product is mostly just a bundling of existing right wing propaganda and fake journalism video channels pandering to far right wingers, including NewsMax, Real America’s Voice, One America News Network, RSBN and Patriot TV.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.ucbjournal.com/non-woke-trump-media-announces-truth-streaming-service-on-roku/">press release</a> for the propaganda bundle claims that this bonanza of bullshit and propaganda is essential in restoring Americans’ sagging trust in news and journalism:</p>
<blockquote> <p><em>“Truth+ is the singular option for non-woke TV and movies, as well as a great alternative to discredited legacy news channels that have squandered the trust of the American people.”</em></p> </blockquote>
<p>While we’re on the topic of U.S. journalism and trust, if you dig through the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=e98085266670db2f&amp;rlz=1C1VDKB_enUS1150US1150&amp;sxsrf=AE3TifMYsoHJRGQMuz7HzDooXGhOQOneZA:1751980229102&amp;q=Truth%2B+launched+globally&amp;tbm=nws&amp;source=lnms&amp;fbs=AIIjpHxU7SXXniUZfeShr2fp4giZrjP_Cx0LI1Ytb_FGcOviEiTm5uW1q0uNfK7KsnoL8hUyUYUJLZ_b-p0lT09DIkR7bwzZ58goNnPFwCobO9Lr1FJy27_ddIL61O5aDZqsFHcHHuRFHQk7kxoaLdgj0KZZIU_JDUonyMsHdJdQkliK1bPwqcc0Qm1U_K-UcOsxPbe_46Hc9znarUsxAr9dQ4t5M01Vcw&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjD99X5qq2OAxXgFjQIHclpEXsQ0pQJKAF6BAgVEAE&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=631&amp;dpr=2">all of the U.S. reporting</a> on this otherwise uninteresting launch of Truth+ <em><strong>you can’t find a single outlet</strong></em> that mentions this isn’t reliable, accurate journalism — much less directly calls out these channels’ history of propaganda. Zero mention, across any of them, that these outlets are filled with conspiracy theories and lies.</p>
<p>Outlets like <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/trump-media-launches-tv-streaming-platform-truth-newsmax/">The Wrap</a> and <a href="https://www.mediaite.com/media/trumps-media-company-partners-with-newsmax-for-new-streaming-platform/">Mediate</a>, for example, just pretty much copy and paste the Trump regime’s press statements on the service. The same at <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-media-launches-tv-streaming-platform-with-newsmax-channel-globally-2025-07-07/">Reuters</a>.</p>
<p>Nobody, at any of the “news” outlets covering the launch of this fake news expansion, mention Trump’s blatant attacks on the First Amendment and real journalism (despite CBS paying Trump <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2025/07/03/institutional-failure-cbs-wimps-out-pays-trump-16-million-bribe-to-settle-baseless-lawsuit/">a <strong>bribe just a week earlier</strong></a>!). Nor do any of the outlets parroting the Truth+ press release bother to mention Trump Media’s repeated run-ins with <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/05/03/business/trump-media-accounting-firm-charged-fraud">super dodgy financial impropriety</a>. Just not relevant, I guess.</p>
<p>Trump+ probably won’t be interesting or popular enough to have much of an actual impact by itself. OAN, for example, makes a lot of noise but historically <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2022/07/22/verizon-gives-oan-the-axe-upsetting-the-six-people-who-still-watch-the-channel/">sees very low viewership numbers</a>. Viewership has been so low, major cable TV providers like <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2022/07/22/verizon-gives-oan-the-axe-upsetting-the-six-people-who-still-watch-the-channel/">Verizon</a> and <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/01/18/court-laughs-off-oan-conspiracy-networks-claim-it-was-censored-by-directv/">DirecTV</a> kicked them out of their lineups, causing no shortage of whining from Trumplicans <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/01/18/court-laughs-off-oan-conspiracy-networks-claim-it-was-censored-by-directv/">falsely claiming they were being unfairly censored</a>.</p>
<p>Still, it’s part of a much broader, and far more successful right wing effort to steadily replace U.S. journalism with <a href="https://www.damemagazine.com/2025/01/02/americas-right-wing-propaganda-problem-might-be-terminal/">lazy culture war infotainment and propaganda</a> as far as the eye can see. Peppered with overlarge, semi-functional corporate media companies <a href="https://www.damemagazine.com/2025/01/02/americas-right-wing-propaganda-problem-might-be-terminal/">too afraid to tell anybody the truth</a>, and a handful of actual journalists increasingly operating on shoestring budgets.</p>
<p>Either way, supposed free thinkers can now more easily fill their heads with billionaire-approved bile, pebbles and hate, literally branded as the truth. Whose to question the wisdom of the free market?</p>
