<p>There’s a reason that the third-party dream has never been made real.</p>
<p>Before we assess the eternally unrealized dream of a potent third party in American politics, let’s consider the specific, recently emergent dream of one specific man: Elon Musk.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, he took a poll on his social media platform and his fans said they wanted him to form a third party so he created the “America Party.” Cool. But … why?</p>
<p>The answer he would give you (if I may be so bold as to translate his social media posts) is that moderate Americans lack a voice from either of the existing major parties and also that those parties are too similar. His intent is to win some federal elections so that his party’s (meaning his) positions have a voice in the room.</p>
<p>But you don’t need a political party for that. Lots of wealthy people with agendas have managed to get sympathetic politicians elected. Musk himself was <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/11/14/did-elon-musks-efforts-pennsylvania-even-do-anything/">so convinced of his own role</a> in getting Donald Trump elected president that he tried to repeat that success in Wisconsin, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/04/02/trump-musk-election-wisconsin-florida-charts/">much more obviously unsuccessfully</a>.</p>
<p>You create a political party to build <i>institutional</i> power, to create a receptacle that pools money and energy on behalf of candidates. And that’s the real question for Musk: Who’s going to help construct that institution? Former Trump adviser Hogan Gidley wasn’t wrong when he said Musk <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/5389622-hogan-gidley-elon-musk-america-party/">has no natural political base</a>, which I’ll discuss more below. But who’s going to donate to a political party created by the richest man in the world? Who’s going to volunteer? Trump managed to get people to donate to a billionaire, but he did so in large part by taking over an established institution with tens of millions of existing members.</p>
<p>We can extend that question by asking who Musk is trying to build power <i>for</i>. Trump did a good job convincing disaffected White people that he was their champion. Musk presents the America Party as the voice of a middle to which he believes he belongs, which in practice means it will be the voice of right-wing people who are centrally worried about the budget deficit and clean energy. He got a taste for power while working in the White House and wants to keep that going, apparently forgetting about the part where he also became wildly unpopular.</p>
<p>(And also? Preliminary data from the 2024 <a href="https://electionstudies.org/">American National Election Studies</a> shows that only a third of registered voters thought both climate and the tackling the deficit were very important issues. But nearly two-thirds of them already have a party: the Democratic Party.)</p>
<p>But let’s step back from Musk to note how silly it is to talk about the creation of a third party, as though there exist two-and-only-two parties at the moment. The reality is that there are dozens of parties, at least <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/List_of_political_parties_in_the_United_States">55 of which have ballot access</a> in at least one state. Saying you’re going to create a third party at this point is a bit like saying you’re going to introduce a fourth car brand.</p>
<p>There are about 65 million registered voters who aren’t Democrats or Republicans, according to analysis of data from the firm L2. In many states, though, voters don’t have to register by party. We can intuit where their political allegiances lie by looking at the ballots they request for party primaries or using other data, but it’s often the case that people aren’t directly members of political parties at all.</p>

<p>Where we do have data on third-party membership generally comes from states where people register with a party, as you would expect.</p>

<p>So to what third parties do voters belong? A lot of them are Libertarians.</p>

<p>The map of Green Party members looks similar, though with fewer members in the Plains states.</p>

<p>One of the third parties with the largest memberships is the American Independent Party, an organization that has thousands of members in California in large part because <a href="https://www.npr.org/2016/05/21/478962916/voters-often-confuse-american-independent-with-independent-party">people accidentally join</a> as they’re attempting to register as independents.</p>
<figure><p class="rw-outer-content"><span>Some content could not be imported from the original document.</span> <a href="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/xke8Q">View content ↗ </a></p></figure>
<p>There are various existing socialist parties, too, which (perhaps unexpectedly) are heavily centered in New Jersey.</p>
<figure><p class="rw-outer-content"><span>Some content could not be imported from the original document.</span> <a href="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/NnjXQ">View content ↗ </a></p></figure>
<p>There is even an Anarchist Party, for those comfortable with cognitive dissonance.</p>

<p>The point is that there are existent political parties for pretty much any political palette, including those with a taste for no government at all. What there <i>isn’t</i> is need for people in many states to register with those parties. Relatedly, there is also not a lot of institutional power within the parties themselves.</p>
<p>Ballot access is part of it. The rules for getting candidates on the ballot intentionally make it hard for nonmajor parties to do so and the major parties (for obvious reasons) have little incentive to revise those rules. This pattern repeats on other dimensions of political power, too: The Democratic and Republican Parties have built enormous institutional power for themselves and aren’t in a rush to hand that power to others.</p>
<p>So let’s look at the last time a nonmajor party gained a foothold in national politics. That came with the H. Ross Perot-led Reform Party, which was formed after Perot leveraged his fortune to get on the presidential ballot in 1992 earning tens of millions of votes around the country — but zero electoral votes, thanks again to the major parties’ systemic advantages.</p>
<p>There are still thousands of Reform Party members around the U.S., mostly in states with large populations.</p>
<figure><p class="rw-outer-content"><span>Some content could not be imported from the original document.</span> <a href="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/s5dCZ">View content ↗ </a></p></figure>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the vast majority of them were of voting age when the Reform Party was formed.</p>
<figure><p class="rw-outer-content"><span>Some content could not be imported from the original document.</span> <a href="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/MMPbq">View content ↗ </a></p></figure>
<p>It was formed, it got Perot on the ballot again in 1996 (far less successfully) and in 2000, it flirted with nominating a guy named Donald Trump as its candidate. (The party opted instead for Pat Buchanan, whose reactionary politics Trump <a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2016/03/trumps-david-duke-amnesia/">excoriated in 2000</a> and exceeded in 2024.) By 2004, the party was essentially dead. In summary: A political party born of discontent with the major parties and founded by a successful, rich politician managed to eke out only a few years of relevance before collapsing.</p>
<p>It is true that the major parties are less popular now than they were then. Analysis of ANES data shows how views of the parties have plunged — though that’s a function mostly of plunging popularity among members of the other major party.</p>
<figure><p class="rw-outer-content"><span>Some content could not be imported from the original document.</span> <a href="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/HNsyd">View content ↗ </a></p></figure>
<p>But this works against Musk’s plan: If Republicans view Democrats extremely negatively, how many of them are going to rush to support a third party that might increase the odds a Democrat gets elected?</p>
<p>Independents, meanwhile, view both parties skeptically. They tend to vote with one party or the other despite that dislike, because they <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2017/09/13/independent-leaners-hate-the-other-party-more-than-they-like-the-one-they-vote-for/">dislike the other party more</a>. In other words, they, too, are often voting strategically.</p>
<p>This, however, doesn’t mean they’re ripe for the plucking, as Musk seems to think. A few years ago, a colleague and I <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/08/29/democratic-republican-polling-issues/">looked at the extent</a> to which partisans held ideologically consistent views. On six policy issues, only pluralities of Democrats and Republicans were consistently supportive of their party’s position across the board. There was a surprising amount of overlap in the positions held by the partisans.</p>
<p>Yet they are still partisans, often because the <i>importance</i> of those issues differs to them as they cast a ballot. Consider ANES data looking at how important deficit reduction is to those who are and are not members of the two major parties.</p>
<figure><p class="rw-outer-content"><span>Some content could not be imported from the original document.</span> <a href="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/mpfQ9">View content ↗ </a></p></figure>
<p>Even a majority of Democrats say it’s at least very important — but they view other things as more important still. Nearly half of Democrats say both that it’s very important to reduce the deficit and that the government should provide many more services. A third of independents and third-party members say the same.</p>
<p>The most obvious answer to the question of who Musk’s America Party is meant to serve is Elon Musk. Maybe he can convince other people to sign on, get candidates to run and maybe even get them elected. As Perot learned, that’s actually the easy part. Building a powerful <i>party</i> takes more than that, and for both ideological and structural reasons has proven very difficult to do.</p>
<p>Just ask millionaire Andrew Yang, who founded the Forward Party after his unsuccessful presidential bid in 2020. He is now <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/07/08/elon-musk-america-party-helpers-challenges">reportedly offering his advice to Musk</a>, for whatever good that will do either of them.</p>
