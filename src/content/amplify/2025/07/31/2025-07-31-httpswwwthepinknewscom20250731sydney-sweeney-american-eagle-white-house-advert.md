<p>Sydney Sweeney has been defended by the White House, which called liberals ‘moronic’ for being upset after her American Eagle ad featuring the phrase ‘Sydney Sweeney has great jeans’ sparked controversy.</p>
<p>The American Eagle advert, which dropped 23 July, features the star of upcoming lesbian biopic <em><a href="https://www.thepinknews.com/2025/07/22/sydney-sweeney-christy-martin-set-photos/">Christy</a></em> telling the camera that she has “great jeans” – a double entendre to do with her own ‘genes’ and her clothing.</p>
<p>The advert prompted <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/sydney-sweeney-american-eagle-ad-video-b2797758.html">intense backlash</a> from liberal voices, who claimed that the ad glorified her caucasian heritage and thin physique.</p>
<p>“Genes are passed down from parents to offspring, often determining traits like hair color, personality and even eye color. My jeans are blue,” Sweeney says in the ad.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.thepinknews.com/2025/07/16/the-onion-trans-parody-video/">White House</a> – the one that President <a href="https://www.thepinknews.com/2025/07/29/trump-epstein-island-privilege/">Donald Trump</a> is in charge of – has now defended Sweeney, and called those outraged “moronic and dense”.</p>

<p>Writing in response to an <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/sydney-sweeney-american-eagle-ad-whiteness-rcna221630">MSNBC article</a> that proposed: “Sydney Sweeney’s ad shows an unbridled cultural shift toward whiteness”, the White House Director of Communications posted to X that the outrage was “Cancel culture run amok.”</p>
<p>“This warped, moronic, and dense liberal thinking is a big reason why Americans voted the way they did in 2024. They’re tired of this bullsh*t,” Steven Cheung <a href="https://x.com/StevenCheung47/status/1950293964453495162">wrote</a>.</p>

<p>Republican commentator <a href="https://www.thepinknews.com/2025/01/24/oscars-trans-karla-sofia-gascon/">Megyn Kelly </a>also weighed in on Sweeney’s side, saying: “She’s being called a white supremacist by people who don’t like her latest ad, which is for American Eagle,” on her podcast.</p>
<p>“She’s advertising jeans, and yet the lunatics on the Left think she’s advertising white supremacy. This is obviously a reference to her body and not to her skin color, but the lunatic left is going to do what the lunatic left is going to do.”</p>
<p>Sweeney’s collaboration with American Eagle also includes the ‘Sydney Jean’ as the campaign’s ‘hero item’ – with all proceeds from the jeans going towards a domestic violence charity.</p>
<p>The jeans are embroidered with a butterfly, with 100 percent of net proceeds donated to Crisis Text Line, a nonprofit that provides free and confidential text-based mental health support and crisis intervention.</p>
<p>Sweeney’s <a href="https://www.thepinknews.com/2025/07/09/sydney-sweeney-says-she-loved-playing-lesbian-sports-star-in-upcoming-biopic/">next project</a> will be <em>Christy</em>, a biopic of lesbian boxer Christy Martin. She will also return for <em>Euphoria’</em>s long awaited <a href="https://www.thepinknews.com/2025/05/26/euphoria-season-3-sydney-sweeney-hunter-schafer-zendaya-cast-release-date-delay/">third season</a>.</p>
