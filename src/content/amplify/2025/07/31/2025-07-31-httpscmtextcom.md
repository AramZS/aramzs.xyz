<h1>About This Textbook</h1>
<p>The Introduction to Computer Music was initially designed as an online text for first-year study of computer music.  This e-book aspires to present information in sufficient depth to be useful to composers, beginning audio engineers and other musicians, professional or otherwise, interested in making music with technology.  The first edition of this text was begun in 2004 with an Indiana University Instructional Development Grant and has served our electronic studio resources course for nearly twenty years as it grew and expanded.  This new edition now encompasses all the topics of the old edition, and new topics are being added from time to time, so do check back. </p>
<p>My thanks to Prof John Gibson, now serving as Director of the IU Center for Electronic and Computer Music, for his advice in making both the old and new editions of this work better.  These pages are free to all for learning and teaching, and if adopted on an external site, I merely ask for acknowledgment of my authorship. The site uses not only traditional hyperlinks (some of which may in time become dead, so some searching might be required), but also pop-up text that is indicated by a <span> <a data-html="true" data-toggle="tooltip" title="This is a pop-up text."> dashed underline </a></span> and may be hovered over to see the information or image.</p>
