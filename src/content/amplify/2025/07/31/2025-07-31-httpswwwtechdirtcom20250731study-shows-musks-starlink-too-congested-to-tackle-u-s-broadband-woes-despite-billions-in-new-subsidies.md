  Study Shows Musk’s Starlink Too Congested To Tackle U.S. Broadband Woes
  Despite Billions In New Subsidies

<h3>from the <i>take-me-to-the-limit</i> dept</h3>
<p>A <a href="https://thexlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Starlink_Analysis_Working_Paper_v0.2.pdf">new study</a> from researchers at X-Lab shows that Elon Musk’s Starlink satellite broadband service lacks the capacity to put a serious dent in U.S. broadband. Despite recent efforts by the Trump administration to <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2025/05/30/republicans-rewrite-infrastructure-broadband-grant-program-to-give-elon-musk-billions-potentially-delaying-deployments-by-years/">rewrite a $42 billion subsidy program</a> with an eye on giving Musk billions in taxpayer dollars.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://thexlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Starlink_Analysis_Working_Paper_v0.2.pdf">researchers found</a> that given the limited nature of satellite physics, the more people that use Starlink, the slower the network is going to get. That’s not a surprise to users who have<a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/09/ookla-starlinks-median-us-download-speed-fell-nearly-30mbps-in-q2-2022/"> increasingly seen slowdowns on the network over the last four years</a>, resulting in speeds that often don’t even meet the FCC’s fairly weak definition for broadband (100 Mbps down, 20 Mbps up).</p>
<p>The researchers estimated that pushing the network past any more than 6.7 Starlink customers per square mile results in significant slowdowns that will get worse. That’s why, they note, it’s a terrible idea for the Trump administration to redirect infrastructure bill grant money from more reliable (often fiber-based and locally owned) ISPs and instead give it to Elon Musk:</p>
<blockquote> <p><em>“Many State Offices are concerned that Starlink proposals may be the lowest bid and alternative proposals may not be within the 15% window for consideration. What this analysis presents is that across many geographic areas Starlink may not be a qualified bidder as it may be unable to attain the required 100/20 Mbps service level (and, in deploying Starlink services, may actually degrade pre-existing users’ services to the point that they no longer receive minimal broadband speeds).”</em></p> </blockquote>
<p>Techdirt has been noting for years how Starlink is a niche service. The nature of satellite physics and capacity means <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/09/ookla-starlinks-median-us-download-speed-fell-nearly-30mbps-in-q2-2022/">slowdowns and annoying restrictions are inevitable</a>, and making it scale to <strong>permanently</strong> meet real-world demand will be challenging if not impossible.</p>
<p>Some Wall Street analysts have been talking about the Starlink capacity crunch <a href="https://www.lightreading.com/satellite/starlink-s-daunting-deployment-plan-leaves-no-margin-for-error-analyst">since a</a><a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2021/04/09/wall-street-analysts-say-musks-starlink-poses-no-real-threat-to-traditional-broadband/">t</a><a href="https://www.lightreading.com/satellite/starlink-s-daunting-deployment-plan-leaves-no-margin-for-error-analyst"> least 2001</a> (and mostly getting ignored). Those same analysts have raised questions about whether Starlink <a href="https://www.lightreading.com/satellite/starlink-s-daunting-deployment-plan-leaves-no-margin-for-error-analyst">can meet its satellite launch goals in order to meet projected targets</a> (spoiler: no).</p>
<p>But Starlink has <strong>also</strong> been criticized for <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/10/19/astronomers-say-starlink-amazon-light-pollution-keeps-getting-worse/">harming astronomical research</a> and the <a href="https://www.space.com/megaconstellations-threat-to-ozone-layer-recovery">ozone layer</a>. Starlink customer service is <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2022/01/27/musks-starlink-continues-to-struggle-with-very-basic-customer-service/">largely nonexistent</a>. And the service is also <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/starlink">too expensive</a> for the folks most in need of reliable broadband access. It’s getting even more expensive as Starlink applies up to $750 “<a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2025/07/01/elon-musks-starlink-adds-750-congestion-charge/">congestion charges</a>” in areas where it knows it can’t meet demand.</p>
<p>This is all before you get to the fact the company’s CEO is an overt white supremacist who basically purchased his own authoritarian U.S. government before his ego ruined the fun.</p>
<p>So yeah, Starlink is a good option if you’re in the middle of nowhere with no other access, can afford it, and have no qualms about doing business with a white supremacist.</p>
<p>It’s not so great if you care about the environment, like to shop ethically, are on a fixed budget, or want to use taxpayer money to ensure widespread broadband availability. Still, because many Republicans still worship at the feet of Elon Musk, they <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2024/10/30/donald-trump-and-joe-rogan-think-elon-musks-starlink-is-akin-to-magic-pixie-dust/">tend to view Starlink as almost akin to magic</a>, helping them justify throwing <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2025/05/30/republicans-rewrite-infrastructure-broadband-grant-program-to-give-elon-musk-billions-potentially-delaying-deployments-by-years/">billions in undeserved subsidies at their billionaire benefactor</a>.</p>
<p>The first Trump FCC tried to give Musk nearly a billion dollars in subsidies to deliver Starlink to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22595004/fcc-spacex-rural-broadband-rdof-parking-lots-airports">some traffic medians and airport parking lots</a>. The Biden FCC reversed the funding, stating (correctly) that Starlink’s bid gamed the system <strong>and</strong> they weren’t sure that Starlink could consistently meet program speed requirements.</p>
<p>That rollback by the Biden FCC resulted in no limit of crying and teeth-gnashing by <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2022/09/19/musks-starlink-says-its-unfair-the-fcc-pulled-886-million-in-subsidies-musk-claims-he-doesnt-want-anyway/">Elon Musk</a> and <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/12/14/republicans-are-mad-the-fcc-rejected-elon-musks-attempt-to-get-a-billion-dollars-in-subsidies-to-deliver-pricey-satellite-broadband-to-some-traffic-medians/">Republicans</a>, who have since dedicated themselves to throwing billions more at the billionaire.</p>
<p>There’s always waste in these programs. But some of the money being directed toward Elon Musk’s congested and expensive satellite service is money directed <strong>away from</strong> popular community-owned and operated fiber providers, or many local small businesses with a genuine, vested interest in bettering the local communities they serve. In short, it has the very real potential to actually make U.S. broadband worse. Under the pretense that we’re fixing the problem for good.</p>
