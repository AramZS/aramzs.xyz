description: Meet the Cholita skaters of Bolivia, fighting for gender equality and indigenous pride by reclaiming their heritage through skating
---

Reconnecting with their ancestry while finding sisterhood through skateboarding, ImillaSkate is an indigenous female skate collective based in the Bolivian city of Cochabamba – bonded through clothing as a symbol of cultural pride. Finding their feet in the foothills of the Bolivian Andes, the young women join a rising number of cholitas, adopting the traditional pollera as a reclamation of indigenous heritage and the female strength carried through Aymara and Quechua traditions.

Travelling to Cochabamba, directors Rebecca Basaure and Mariano Carranza center the collective and their role in the community for the short documentary ImillaSkate - The Cholita Skaters of Bolivia, created with Optimist. Challenging gender stereotypes through their contradictions, while making space for indigenous pride, the young women carve out a story of rebellion, reclamation, and radical joy against a landscape where racial prejudice and gender violence remain an ever-present concern.

“In a country where being a woman, and being indigenous, still means fighting for space, Imillaskate follows the girls who carve that space – literally – on trucks and wheels. Their skateboards become tools of cultural pride, and their bodies in motion become a language of self-determination. We hope to show what we saw: not just girls skating, but a revolution in polleras.”

Using their influence to inspire young girls in their neighborhood, the film follows the cholita skaters as they fight for the infrastructure to expand their skate school into a social enterprise, staging a small-scale revolution by illuminating their ancestors to reshape the landscape for the younger generation.
