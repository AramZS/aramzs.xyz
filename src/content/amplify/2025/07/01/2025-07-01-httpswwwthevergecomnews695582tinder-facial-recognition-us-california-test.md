  Tinder now requires new users in California to complete a facial recognition
  check to prove they are real people. This check uses a short video selfie to
  match their face with profile photos and prevent fake accounts. The feature
  aims to improve safety and may expand across the US if successful.

<p>Tinder is trialing mandatory facial recognition security features in the US to verify profiles and crack down on impersonation and fake accounts. New users in California are now required to provide a biometric “Face Check” scan to confirm their face matches their profile photos for the dating service, <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/06/30/tinder-face-check-safety"><em>Axios </em>reported on Monday</a>.</p>
<p>The Face Check feature involves taking a short video selfie that’s used to match biometric indicators and prove that the Tinder user isn’t a bot using artificially generated images, providing them with a verified badge upon completion. The scan will also check if the user’s face is being used in multiple accounts, which could help to prevent users from being impersonated or having their likeness used by deceptive “catfish” profiles.</p>
<p>Face Check is separate from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/20/24078089/tinder-blue-verification-checkmark-id-upload">Tinder’s ID Check feature</a>, which uses government-issued ID to verify users’ age and identity, while Face Check seemingly only requires users to upload a selfie video. Tinder users have provided video selfies to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/26/23698503/tinder-video-selfie-verification-security">verify their profiles since 2023</a>, but verification wasn’t a mandatory requirement for creating a Tinder account. This change means that Californians will have to complete some version of verification if they want to use the platform at all.</p>
<p>“We see this as one part of a set of identity assurance options that are available to users,” Match Group’s head of trust and safety, Yoel Roth, told <em>Axios</em>. “Face Check ... is really meant to be about confirming that this person is a real, live person and not a bot or a spoofed account.”</p>
<p>Tinder says the selfie video is deleted once verification is complete, but that the platform stores a “non-reversible, encrypted face map” to detect duplicate user accounts in the future.</p>
<p>The Face Check feature has already been piloted in Colombia and Canada, with Roth telling <em>Axios</em> that those tests showed “promising” results in “improving perceptions of authenticity” and reducing reports of bad actors. Tinder will now monitor how users in California respond to the Face Check feature before deciding if it should be rolled out more broadly across the US, according to Roth.</p>
