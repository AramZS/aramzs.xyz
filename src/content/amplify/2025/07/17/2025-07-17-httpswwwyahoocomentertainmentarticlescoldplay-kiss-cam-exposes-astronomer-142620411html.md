<p>What was meant to be a lighthearted moment during Coldplay’s Wednesday night concert turned into a full blown public relations disaster for a high flying tech CEO and the footage is nothing short of mortifying.</p>
<p>During the band’s performance at Gillette Stadium in Boston frontman Chris Martin decided to spice up the crowd with the classic <em><a data-ylk="slk:kiss cam;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://whereisthebuzz.com/footage-of-chris-martin-calling-out-possibly-cheating-couple-on-kiss-cam-at-coldplay-boston-show-goes-viral/?jetpack_skip_subscription_popup">kiss cam</a></em>. But what happened next left the audience gasping the internet spiraling and one billion dollar CEO potentially facing a career ending scandal.</p>
<h3><strong>“Oh Look at These Two” A Kiss Cam Catastrophe</strong></h3>
<p>As the camera panned across the thousands of fans in attendance, it suddenly landed on Andy Byron, the married CEO of Astronomer, a software development firm reportedly valued at over $1 billion, and his Chief People Officer, Kristin Cabot.</p>
<p>The pair looked cozy, too cozy. Byron had his arms wrapped around Cabot, who leaned in closely, smiling, but as soon as they noticed themselves on Coldplay’s kiss cam, they panicked and made the situation much worse. Byron let go immediately, ducking behind a barrier like a man caught red-handed, while Cabot buried her face in her hands, visibly flustered.</p>
<p>That’s when Chris Martin twisted the knife with comic precision</p>
<blockquote><p>“<em>Oh what either they’re having an affair or they’re very shy</em>” he quipped prompting roars of laughter from the unsuspecting crowd.</p></blockquote>
<h3><strong>The Internet Thinks It’s Caught an Affair in 4K</strong></h3>
<p>If the public display of discomfort wasn’t damning enough the footage made its way to X (formerly Twitter) and TikTok where it has since gone viral racking up millions of views and thousands of retweets.</p>
<p>And while neither Byron nor Cabot have responded publicly social media has already made up its mind</p>
<p>Here are just a few of the brutal reactions</p>
<ol><li><p>“What happens in the DARK will always come to the LIGHT!! EVERY SINGLE TIME!!”</p></li><li><p>“You know if they didn’t react like this this wouldn’t go viral</p><figure><img alt="��" data-nimg="1" src="https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/K3NIZ_CfpLGc8Jfoo5uGPA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTExMDtoPTExMDtjZj13ZWJw/https://media.zenfs.com/en/where_is_the_buzz_814/6ad7d7fb47f9e7aa5536c9ce52b3056a"/><br/><figcaption>�� </figcaption></figure><p>they tried to hide but exposed themselves instead”</p></li><li><p>“They made it so much worse by reacting that way”</p></li><li><p>“Imagine if his wife and her husband were Coldplay fans”</p></li><li><p>“LMAO! That’s what they get”</p></li></ol>
<p>Support for Byron’s wife, Megan Kerrigan Byron, has been pouring in with users tagging her in posts and urging her to “check social media now.”</p>
<h3><strong>Who Are Andy Byron and Kristin Cabot</strong></h3>
<p>According to his LinkedIn Andy Byron has served as CEO of Astronomer since July 2023 and previously held high level positions at cybersecurity and software firms. Astronomer which specializes in data orchestration tools for companies is widely respected in the tech world with clients ranging from banks to media companies.</p>
<p>Cabot his HR chief joined the company nine months ago describing herself on LinkedIn as someone who “wins trust with employees of all levels from CEOs to managers to assistants.” Her title Chief People Officer and that title has never sounded more ironic.</p>
<p>Together they were supposed to be the face of a high functioning tech empire. Now they’re the unwitting stars of what the internet is calling the “<em>Coldplay Cheater Cam</em>”</p>
