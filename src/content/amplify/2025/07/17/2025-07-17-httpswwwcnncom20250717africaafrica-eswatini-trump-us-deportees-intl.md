<p>While the Trump administration’s mass deportations to the prisons of El Salvador have made headlines around the world, the White House has also been quietly attempting to strike agreements with a number of African countries to accept deportees originally from other nations.</p>
<p>President Donald Trump’s aggressive clampdown on immigration has run into logistical hurdles, with some countries refusing to take back their nationals, or doing so only on a limited basis.</p>

<p>Some of those approached by the US, such as Nigeria, have decried being pressured to take in foreign deportees.</p>

<p>Eswatini government spokesperson Mdluli said the nation would now collaborate with the US and the International Organization for Migration (IOM) “to facilitate the transit of these inmates to their countries of origin.”</p>
<p>She told CNN Thursday, however, that “there are no timelines at present” for their repatriation.</p>
<p>Eswatini’s decision to accommodate America’s deportees has met with widespread public disapproval, both due to the perceived risk around their presence and the US portrayal of the nation as a “safe third country.”</p>

<p>Opposition party PUDEMO said accepting foreign deportees from the US “poses a serious risk to our already vulnerable communities” which it said are “battling a severe scourge” of crime, including rape and murder.</p>
<p>“Our country must not be treated as a dumping ground for those deemed unfit to live elsewhere,” the group said in a statement sent to CNN.</p>
<p>Lucky Lukhele, of the Swaziland Solidarity Network, an exiled civil society group based in South Africa, told CNN it was “clear racism to think Africa is a dumping ground for Donald Trump.”</p>
<p>Lukhele said he was informed by unnamed sources that more US deportees would be sent to Eswatini, warning that “Swazi prisons are (already) overcrowded” with prisoners who “get one meal a day.”</p>

Its neighbor and biggest trading partner, South Africa, was also slapped with a 30% tariff, triggering panic from Eswatini’s central bank on the <a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.centralbank.org.sz%2Fcbe-governor-tackles-how-us-tariffs-developments-impact-eswatini%2F&amp;data=05%7C02%7Cnimi.princewill%40wbdcontractor.com%7C90ab39df77f8402c34c008ddc5359370%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638883556074588071%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=C5k1pQpQMqJkLhe2fh5%2FPWfRsPpkvKxy6XHJSLGA9xs%3D&amp;reserved=0">“implications”</a> for its economy.

<p>Its intake of US deportees has similarly generated uproar in South Africa, whose relations with the US have <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/21/politics/trump-ramaphosa-oval-office-ambush">deteriorated under Trump</a>.</p>
<p>A South African government source told CNN, “There is a feeling that some inside the Trump administration could be using this (the deportation of prisoners to Eswatini) to destabilize South Africa,” given its porous borders and Eswatini’s struggling economy.</p>
<p>“Everyone knows that these fellows (the deported convicts) will want to move to South Africa” another diplomatic source said, adding that the US “did (ask South Africa to accept migrants) and we refused.”</p>
<p>The source said the deportations to Eswatini were a provocation by the US and a direct national security threat.</p>
<p>Ken Opalo, an associate professor at Georgetown University’s School of Foreign Service inWashington, DC, said African nations are being pushed by the Trump administration “into doing egregious things such as accepting migrants from random countries or giving them (the US) their mineral wealth in ambiguous deals that don’t make much sense.”</p>
<p>He cautioned: “It’s foolhardy for African countries to think that they can make deals and expect a credible commitment from the White House, given their transactional nature, which means everything is subject to change.”</p>
