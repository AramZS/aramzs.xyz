<p>White House officials are preparing an executive order targeting tech companies with what they see as “woke” artificial-intelligence models, their latest effort to go after <a href="https://archive.is/o/vWm5e/https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/fight-against-dei-dominates-start-of-trumps-second-term-fea62a30">diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives</a>, people familiar with the matter said.</p>
