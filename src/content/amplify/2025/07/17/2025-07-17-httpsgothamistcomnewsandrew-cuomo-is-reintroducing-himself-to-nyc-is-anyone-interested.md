<p>A man known to nearly all New Yorkers stood on a leafy block of the Upper East Side and began the awkward process of reintroducing himself.</p>
<p>“Hello, I’m Andrew Cuomo, and unless you've been living under a rock, you probably know that the Democratic primary did not go the way I had hoped,” the former governor said directly into the camera, before cutting to b-roll of him casually giving a city parks employee a fist bump.</p>
<p>Cuomo shook hands at a fruit stand, posed for selfies outside a grocery store and even apologized for letting down people who voted for him.</p>
<p>Was this a preview of a humbled politician with a newfound desire to connect with the city’s voters? Or is it a gimmick on par with the Steve Buscemi meme from “30 Rock,” where he dons a baseball cap and says, “How do you do, fellow kids?”</p>
<p>Cuomo’s campaign in the Democratic primary served as a reminder of the former governor’s comfort zone. He was inaccessible to both voters and the press. He sought to project an aura of inevitability, reminding voters of the tremendous power he wielded while in Albany. But voters didn’t buy it.</p>
<p>“ He ran a Rose Garden strategy in the primary and voters picked up on it and commented, quite significantly as the race concluded,” said Basil Smikle, the former chair of the New York State Democratic Party and a professor of practice at Columbia University’s School of Professional Studies.</p>
<p>Now, Cuomo is testing new strategies and hiring new staff. He’s already done interviews with <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/nyc-mayor-race-andrew-cuomo-on-rematch-with-zohran-mamdani.html">New York magazine</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymD6Lp22ysM">NY1</a>, among others.</p>
<p>And he’s repeatedly making an admission that was once nearly unthinkable: He screwed up.</p>
<p>“I am truly sorry that I let you down,” Cuomo said.</p>
<p>The former governor is known for a lot of things, but being warm and fuzzy aren’t among them. Staffers have accused him of running a toxic workplace, and political critics have said Cuomo seeks retribution from those who’ve slighted him.</p>
<p>In the new campaign video, Cuomo tries to embody some of Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani’s ebullience — as well as his policies on affordability. Cuomo is still, however, mispronouncing his competitor’s name.</p>
<p>Smikle said a shiny, happy Cuomo might leave people scratching their heads.</p>
<p>“ Should he try to change course and be more engaging and more accessible, I think a lot of voters would read that as inauthentic and they're looking for authenticity,” Smikle said.</p>
<p>Cuomo’s losing margin to Mamdani ticked up again this week to 12.8 points after the Board of Elections latest ranked-choice tabulation added more mail and absentee ballots to the total.</p>
<p>Many voters remember a version of Cuomo that brought them great comfort. Talk to a Cuomo supporter and it won’t be long before they invoke his daily televised briefings during the depths of the COVID-19 pandemic, where he offered clarity to sequestered New Yorkers searching for guidance.</p>
<p>But Cuomo’s legacy has since been tarnished by sexual harassment accusations from more than a dozen women, allegations that he bungled the state’s COVID response with lethal consequences, a $5 million book deal on the pandemic that was allegedly prepared by state employees and, most recently, a federal investigation into whether he lied to Congress about his response to the pandemic.</p>
<p>Cuomo denies all wrongdoing and now, after being roundly rejected by Democratic voters in New York City, he appears to be looking to capture some of Mamdani’s magic. He says he’ll be making his case directly to voters. But does that mean he’ll be having the types of unfiltered interactions that made Mamdani such an engaging candidate?</p>
<p>The Cuomo campaign put out another video on Tuesday showing Cuomo helping a New Yorker jump his car battery. But it’s not necessarily a scene that will resonate with the millions of city straphangers sweating it out on a stalled or flooded train.</p>
<p>During the primary, Gothamist proposed a subway ride with Cuomo to discuss his campaign and witness how he interacts with riders. The offer still stands!</p>
