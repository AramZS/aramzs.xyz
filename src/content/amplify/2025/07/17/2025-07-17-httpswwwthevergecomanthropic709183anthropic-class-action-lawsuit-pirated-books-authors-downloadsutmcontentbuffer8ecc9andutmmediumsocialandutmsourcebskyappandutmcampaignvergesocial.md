<p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/hayden-field">Hayden Field</a> is The Verge’s senior AI reporter. An AI beat reporter for more than five years, her work has also appeared in CNBC, MIT Technology Review, Wired UK, and other outlets.</p>
<p>A California federal judge ruled Thursday that three authors suing Anthropic over copyright infringement can bring a class action lawsuit representing all U.S. writers whose work was allegedly downloaded from libraries of pirated works.</p>
<p>The filing alleges that Anthropic, the Amazon-backed OpenAI competitor behind the chatbot Claude, “violated the Copyright Act by doing Napster-style downloading of millions of works.” It alleges that the company downloaded as many as seven million copies of books from libraries of pirated works.</p>
<p>The new ruling impacts a lawsuit filed last August by authors Andrea Bartz, Charles Graeber, and Kirk Wallace Johnson, who <a href="https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/legaldocs/gdvzmggwjpw/ANTHROPIC%20AUTHOR%20COPYRIGHT%20LAWSUIT%20complaint.pdf">alleged</a> that Anthropic had “built a multibillion-dollar business by stealing hundreds of thousands of copyrighted books.” Late last month, a federal judge <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/692015/anthropic-wins-a-major-fair-use-victory-for-ai-but-its-still-in-trouble-for-stealing-books">sided with Anthropic</a> to rule that training its AI models on legally-purchased books was fair use but noted the company would need to face a separate trial for using allegedly pirated books.</p>
<p>It also follows the lawsuit Reddit filed against Anthropic <a href="https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/679768/reddit-sues-anthropic-alleging-its-bots-accessed-reddit-more-than-100000-times-since-last-july">last month</a>, claiming that the AI company’s bots had accessed Reddit more than 100,000 times since last July, after Anthropic had said it blocked them from doing so.</p>
<p>The authors’ lawsuit is part of a growing trend of media outlets, platforms, companies, and creatives either suing AI companies over copyright infringement — for instance, Universal Music’s 2023 lawsuit against Anthropic over “systematic and widespread infringement of their copyrighted song lyrics” — or partnering up with them to willingly provide AI training data in order to get a slice of the profits.</p>
