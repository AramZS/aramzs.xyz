<h2 data-gu-name="standfirst">Mike Pence is latest prominent figure to call for release of files on sex offender once close to president </h2>
<p><a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>’s efforts to dismiss the criticism over his administration’s handling of the <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeffrey-epstein">Jeffrey Epstein</a> files as a “hoax” showed no sign of working on Thursday as more prominent figures from across the political spectrum emerged to attack the US president and some of his supporters recorded videos burning their signature Make America Great Again hats.</p>
<p>Days after the Republican speaker of the House, the Trump loyalist <a data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/mike-johnson">Mike Johnson</a>, called for the release of all documents relating to the late financier, a convicted sex offender and longtime former friend of Trump’s, rebellion continued to simmer within the president’s normally diehard base.</p>
<p>Trump’s former vice-president, Mike Pence, <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mike-pence-on-jeffrey-epstein-files-trump/">told CBS News</a> on Wednesday that “I think the time has come for the administration to release all of the files regarding Jeffrey Epstein’s investigation and prosecution”, while the conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer, a frequent close adviser to Trump, <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/07/16/trump-epstein-maga-anger-00456207">called for the appointment</a> of a special counsel to handle the Epstein files investigation. “Obviously, this is not a complete hoax given the fact that [Epstein associate] Ghislaine Maxwell is currently serving 20 years in prison in Florida for her crimes and activities with Jeffrey Epstein, who we know is a convicted sexual predator,” she said.</p>
<p>The podcast host Theo Von, who attended Trump’s inauguration and told Fox News it was “<a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/theo-von-attends-trumps-inspiring-inauguration-urges-time-put-america-first">inspiring</a>”, <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://x.com/TheoVon/status/1945590466441081144?s=31">commented</a> “yeah what changed” on a video of the vice-president, JD Vance, appearing on Von’s show in 2024 and calling for the full Epstein list to be released.</p>
<p>Even some of Trump’s most loyal allies in Congress say they are not satisfied by his decision to not release additional files from the Epstein case.</p>
<p>Senator Josh Hawley questioned the justice department’s claims about the files, saying: “I think it is maybe a little difficult to believe the idea that DoJ and the FBI … don’t have any idea who Epstein’s clients were”, and called for Maxwell to testify.</p>
<p>In rare moment of friction between Trump and Johnson, meanwhile, the House speaker broke with the president on Tuesday, calling for the justice department to make more Epstein documents public, and urging Pam Bondi, the attorney general, to “come forward and explain” the situation. Bondi has come under particular attack for appearing to claim earlier in the year that she had a client list of Epstein’s, then declaring last week no such list existed.</p>

<p>Still, House Republicans <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.axios.com/2025/07/15/trump-epstein-khanna-doj-democrats-republicans">voted twice this week</a> to block Democratic attempts to force the public release of all Epstein files within 30 days, with only <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://newrepublic.com/post/197950/house-republicans-block-release-epstein-files">one Republican</a>, Ralph Norman of South Carolina, voting in favor.</p>
<p>The controversy deepened on Wednesday evening after news that the federal prosecutor Maurene Comey, daughter of former FBI director James Comey, who worked on the criminal cases of both Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, had been fired. The justice department provided no specific reason for her dismissal.</p>
<p>As the backlash spirals out of his normally firm grasp on the Maga voter, Trump slammed “foolish Republicans” on Wednesday who he said were helping Democrats by focusing on documents related to Epstein.</p>
<p>“Some stupid Republicans and foolish Republicans fall into the net, and so they try and do the Democrats’ work,” Trump said during an Oval Office meeting with the crown prince of Bahrain. “I call it the Epstein hoax. Takes a lot of time and effort. Instead of talking about the great achievements we’ve had … they’re wasting their time with a guy who obviously had some very serious problems, who died three, four years ago.”</p>
<p>Close to seven in 10 Americans in a recent <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-faces-backlash-69-believe-epstein-details-concealed-reutersipsos-poll-2025-07-17/">Reuters/Ipsos poll</a> said details around Epstein were being concealed. Sixty-nine per cent said they believed there had been concealment of facts on Epstein’s clients by the federal government, with close to 25% unsure whether facts had been concealed, according to the poll.</p>
<p>Epstein was arrested on sex-trafficking charges and is believed to have died by suicide in prison in 2019, according to authorities. His former associate Maxwell was convicted of sex trafficking and is serving a 20-year sentence.</p>
