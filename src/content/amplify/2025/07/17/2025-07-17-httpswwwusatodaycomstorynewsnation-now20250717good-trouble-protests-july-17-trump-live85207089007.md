<p>Civil rights activist and Georgia Congressman John Lewis was known for saying he got into "good trouble" by using peaceful, non-violent action to challenge injustice. Now, in 1,600 cities and towns across the country, protesters are <a data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" href="https://goodtroubleliveson.org/">planning to make similar "good trouble"</a> on July 17,<a data-id="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/07/16/good-trouble-protests-trump-civil-rights/85197446007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" data-type="link" href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/07/16/good-trouble-protests-trump-civil-rights/85197446007/"> the fifth anniversary of Lewis' death.</a></p>
<p>“What we want the nation to know is that his legacy lives on, that the good trouble that he got into and that he fought for is not over," said Barbara Arnwine, co-leader of the Transformative Justice Coalition. "We are absolutely focused on making sure that our voices throughout the country are raised.”</p>
<p>Protesters are turning out for a variety of reasons, including their opposition to the recently passed budget bill, attacks on womens rights and diversity, and immigration enforcement, such as <a data-id="https://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/donald-trump/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" data-type="link" href="https://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/donald-trump/">President Donald Trump</a>'s decision to <a data-id="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/07/15/trump-administration-pulls-national-guard-california-immigration/85220727007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" data-type="link" href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/07/15/trump-administration-pulls-national-guard-california-immigration/85220727007/">call out the California National Guard</a> to quell pro-immigrant protests in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>“We have a president that is deploying (the) National Guard to actually stop peaceful protests, and it's making things more dangerous for people, and making things harder for people who just want to stand up, protect their neighbors and speak out, which is something that we're allowed to do," said Allison Pulliam, co-director of Declaration for American Democracy Coalition.</p>
<p>A White House spokesperson said this week that President <a data-autotag="26f031d1-9924-4f10-b4e6-019d076113d5" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" href="https://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/donald-trump/">Donald Trump</a> is doing what he promised to do on the campaign trail.</p>
<p>“Nearly 80 million Americans gave President Trump a historic mandate to Make America Great Again and he is delivering on that promise in record time,” said White House spokesperson Liz Huston.</p>
<h2>Ohio Statehouse protest</h2>
<h2>‘If you think your voice doesn’t count, it does’ </h2>
<p>Kim Lowery stood near the edge of the intersection on Colonial Boulevard and Cleveland Avenue in Fort Myers, Florida, her voice steady but heavy with emotion as she described why she drove from Georgia to attend the Fort Myers rally. More than 200 people lined the streets. “I’m terrified for this country,” she said. “Every day, all I see from this administration is something else being taken away: lives ruined, services stripped from the most vulnerable.”</p>
<p>Lowery, whose mother lives in Fort Myers, said she’s watched tensions grow in her family’s neighborhood.</p>
<p>“I’m afraid for my friends here who are Black, Brown or anything but white. It’s caused so much division between neighbors, between people who used to understand each other.”</p>
<p>Showing up matters, she said.</p>
<p>“Even if you think your voice doesn’t count, it does. And if you can’t come out, then write your representatives. Let them know we don’t want a government that tramples humanity.”</p>

<h2>Road side protests in big and small towns</h2>
<h2>Protesting education cuts</h2>
<p>Michael J. Barksdale Jr., a Chicago Public Schools councilor, said he showed up to protest Trump's cuts to education.“It’s a personal issue for me because I’m an educator and it’s imperative that our students, our teachers, our support staff have the foundation to support the well-being of our students who are our future,” said Barksdale, 36.</p>
<p>The South Side resident was among many gathered at Chicago's Daley Plaza listening to speeches given by local leaders and officials, including everyone city pastors to social security administrators.</p>
<p>“The movement continues,” he said, noting his John Lewis shirt. “It continues on to the next generation. It’s our turn to step up to fight for civil rights.”</p>

<h2>Washington, D.C. protesters begin to march</h2>
<p>A few hundred people attended a rally in Washington, D.C. before marching to the National Museum of African American History and Culture.</p>
<p>People carried signs and umbrella's with slogans written on the top in the concert-like atmosphere as they listened to impassioned speeches.</p>
<p>Dozens of similar protests and rallies took place in the nearby Maryland and Virginia suburbs.</p>

<h2>Yonkers, N.Y.</h2>
<p>Over 100 people gathered in downtown Yonkers, New York July 17, many carrying homemade signs. Speakers of various ages spoke about the legacy of Lewis.</p>
<p>It was <a data-id="https://www.lohud.com/story/news/local/2025/07/17/good-trouble-lives-on-protests-live-updates-westchester-rockland-ny-july-17/85243741007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" data-type="link" href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2025/07/17/good-trouble-lives-on-protests-live-updates-westchester-rockland-ny-july-17/85243741007/">one of several protests</a> taking place in the northern New York suburbs.</p>

<h2>'We refuse to accept Donald Trump'</h2>
<p>Hundreds gathered in Chicago on an unseasonably cool day in the city’s iconic Loop neighborhood within sight of Trump Tower.“In the name of humanity we refuse to accept an oligarchic Americas, a fascist America,” protesters chanted. “We refuse to accept Donald Trump.”Among them was Megan Hunt, a 25-year-old public school social worker worker who made the 90 minute drive from Aurora, Illinois, to stand up for the immigrant students who have stopped coming to school.“This is very personal for me,” she said. “Every day we’re losing more and more rights.”Hunt said her older brother also attended a Good Trouble protest in Indianapolis on Thursday.“It’s important to raise our voices now when it’s still legal to do so,” she said.</p>

<h2>Good music and community building</h2>
<p>Chicago resident Susana Darwin, 61, showed up holding the flag of Greenland, a prop for an independent movie she made. Now she admires it for the way Greenlanders “stood up to bullies” when Vice President <a data-autotag="6b71af8d-ad9a-443f-8e59-85794a07967e" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" href="https://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/jd-vance/">JD Vance</a> tried visiting the island and locals made it known American expansionist aspirations weren’t welcome.“Community building is heavily dependent on showing up and so it’s good to know we’re not alone,” she said surveying the crowd swaying to Madonna’s Holiday played. “We’re not alone in sharing the outrage and wishing things to be different. The administration needs to be reminded no one is above the law.”She added: “Joy is going to be a big part of that community building so I’m glad they’re playing good music.”As if on cue the DJ began playing the Cha-Cha Slide, a staple at any Chicago gathering.</p>

<h2>'We are the giant that has woken up'</h2>
<p>Outside the Indiana Statehouse Julie Borum spoke about the goodness that can be found in seemingly hopeless places to a <a data-id="https://www.indystar.com/live-story/news/local/2025/07/17/good-trouble-anti-trump-protest-at-indiana-statehouse-on-thursday/85256504007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" data-type="link" href="https://www.indystar.com/live-story/news/local/2025/07/17/good-trouble-anti-trump-protest-at-indiana-statehouse-on-thursday/85256504007/">crowd of fewer than 1,000 people</a>.</p>
<p>She encouraged everyone not to give up under the weight of “the stupidity of this administration,” pointing out that change is a result of sustained peaceful protest. The growing grassroots movement across the country was inspiring, she said.</p>
<p>"We are the giant that has woken up," Borum said.</p>

<h2>Eric Garner’s mother stands with mothers of children detained in immigration crackdown</h2>
<p>At a protest in New York City, <a data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" href="https://www.usatoday.com/videos/news/2021/04/02/mother-eric-garner-theres-no-justice-only-closure-me/4835791001/">Gwen Carr</a>, the <a data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2019/07/17/eric-garner-protest-youths-want-nypd-officers-fired/1753656001/">mother of Eric Garner</a>, joined mothers whose children have been detained in immigration crackdowns.</p>
<p>On July 17, 2014, a New York City police officer fatally put Garner in a stranglehold for allegedly selling loose cigarettes. Eleven years later, Carr, who has advocated for police reform after her son’s death, stood outside the Manhattan federal building housing immigration court, where migrants have been detained attending hearings.</p>
<p>“It’s a sad thing to be separated from your family,” Carr said at a press conference. “Although I’m permanently separated from mine, they have a chance of finding their family.”</p>
<p>Raiza's son Dylan, a <a data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" href="https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/378-25/city-new-york-takes-action-support-public-school-student-who-was-arrested-after-attending">20-year-old Venezuelan-born Bronx student</a>, was detained while trying to attend his routine court hearing in May. “I don’t want my son to be forgotten,” Raiza said. She wore a heart monitor on her chest, which she told reporters her doctor ordered her to wear due to her stress and anxiety.</p>

<h2>Stay in the fight </h2>
<p>Tamika Middleton, Managing Director of the Women's March, told USA TODAY the size of the protests aren’t as important as sustained resistance. The Women’s March drew millions to protest after the first inauguration of President Donald Trump, and the size of many protests since have been compared to it.</p>
<p>"We recognize that there are peak moments and that not every protest is going to be as large," she said.</p>
<p>There are inflection moments, like the ICE raids in Los Angeles that took place right before the No Kings protests in June, where people are really galvanized to turn out, but organizers know they can't expect those to happen every time.</p>
<p>Instead, they continue to hold protests and events to "give people an invitation to stay in the fight," she said.</p>

<h2>How to attend?</h2>
<p>Organizers have a <a data-id="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/07/15/good-trouble-lives-on-protest-locations/85209977007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" data-type="link" href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/07/15/good-trouble-lives-on-protest-locations/85209977007/">map of events</a> taking place in large and small cities around the country. Some are rallies and protests, others involve voter registration drives or collecting food for food banks.</p>
<p>Most areas have multiple events planned, and in many cases attendees do not need to RSVP to attend.</p>
<p>In Los Angeles, protesters plan to gather at City Hall and hold a candlelight vigil for John Lewis, other civil rights leaders, and community members taken by ICE in recent weeks.</p>
<p>In Lafayette, Indiana, people are gathering to write letters to voters at the West Lafayette Library.</p>
<h2>When do they start?</h2>
<p>Because they take place on a Thursday, many of the protests are scheduled to occur after the workday ends. Many of the morning events are organized as honk-and-wave protests at overpasses during rush hour.</p>
<p>Organizers said they aren't worried the weekday timing will affect the number of protesters.</p>
<p>Over 231,000 people were registered to attend by the afternoon of July 15. For previous demonstrations, signups have totaled only a fraction of those who actually turned up to protest.</p>
<p>The Good Trouble protests follow the <a data-id="https://www.usatoday.com/videos/news/2025/06/14/millions-march-in-no-kings-protests-across-country/84210729007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" data-type="link" href="https://www.usatoday.com/videos/news/2025/06/14/millions-march-in-no-kings-protests-across-country/84210729007/">No Kings protests on June 14</a>, which drew millions of Americans at more than 2,000 locations across the country.</p>
<h2>Why now?</h2>
<p>Leslie Proll, senior director, of the Voting Rights Program at the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, pointed out that the protests are happening just weeks before the 60th anniversary of President Lyndon Johnson's signing the Voting Rights Act, on Aug. 6, 1965.</p>
<p>“In this moment, more than ever, we need to lift up our affirmative vision for a multiracial democracy in which everyone can participate,” she said.</p>
<p>April Albright, legal director and chief of staff of Black Voters Matter, said Americans need to come out to defend one another once again.</p>
<p>“We need to march, yes. We should protest, yes. We should do our local elections, because power is birthed from the ground up," she said. "But we need every single facet of our communities actively engaging.”</p>
