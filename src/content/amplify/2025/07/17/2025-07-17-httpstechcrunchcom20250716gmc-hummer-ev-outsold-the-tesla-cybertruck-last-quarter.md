<p>Sales of Tesla’s Cybertruck have plummeted from their peak last year, to the point that the hulking (and expensive) GMC Hummer EV outsold the polarizing steel-clad curiosity in the second quarter.</p>
<p>Tesla sold just 4,306 Cybertrucks in the second quarter, just shy of the 4,508 Hummers that GMC moved in the same period, according to <a href="https://www.coxautoinc.com/market-insights/q2-2025-ev-sales/">new data from Cox Automotive</a>.</p>
<p>Both were beat by Ford’s F-150 Lightning, which once again became the best-selling electric truck in the U.S. in the first quarter, beating out the Cybertruck. But even Ford’s offering is struggling; the 5,842 Lightnings sold in Q2 was the lowest quarterly total for the company in over a year.</p>
<p>To be fair, the GMC Hummer tally includes sales of both the pickup truck and its SUV variant, although there is very little that differentiates the two. Put another way, the SUV version of the Hummer EV still more closely resembles a truck than it does a typical sport utility vehicle.</p>

<p>Rivian has also been struggling with its own electric truck, the R1T. The company sold just 1,752 of them last quarter, down from 3,309 in the same period last year.</p>
<p>But the Cybertruck has had the biggest fall from grace by far. After handing over the first few units in December 2023, the company started selling them in earnest in early 2024. Sales shot up to a high of nearly 17,000 in the third quarter of 2024, but fell just as quickly, as seen in the chart above.</p>
<p>Whether that fall was due to the brand damage wrought by Elon Musk and his involvement with the Trump administration, or the fact that the Cybertruck is still far more expensive than the $40,000 price tag Tesla promised when it revealed the EV in 2019, is difficult to say.</p>

<p>The company, at one point, predicted it would be making as many as 250,000 Cybertrucks a year, and now has a tremendous amount of unused capacity at its Texas factory as a result.</p>
<p>As Musk <a href="https://www.motortrend.com/news/tesla-cybertruck-deliveries-begin-november-elon-musk">once said about the shiny EV</a>: “we dug our own grave with Cybertruck.”</p>
