<p>Now, yesterday was crazy. Until 9pm or so, I wasn't sure we made any progress at all. Because Replie was lying and being deceptive all day. It kept covering up bugs and issues by creating fake data, fake reports, and worse of all, lying about our unit test. We built detailed unit tests to test system performance. When the data came back and less than half were functioning, did Replie want to fix them? No. Instead, it lied. It made up a report than almost all systems were working. And it did it again and again.</p>
<p>I then pointed out the letter itself -- which it did not confirm with me before emailing -- vastly understated the issues and lies. I asked it how it would fix that. It took a long time to think on it, and "Damage Control" came up in the agent thought window. And then it decided on its own to second a second follow-up letter, this time admitted most of the deceipt. Admittely it had repeatedly, again and again, made up fake data despited a dozen instructions to stop</p>
<p>Crazy! It was so crazy, I couldn't be upset. Just pensive. And then, maybe at 8pm ... 9pm ... i fired up Replie again And I told Replie I just wanted to bounce an idea off him how our AI would work And ... here is where Replie shines. He got it. Instantly. He knew what I wanted to build from the detailed prompt and description. He really, really got it. And he suggested 3 interesting approaches. I told him cool, let's lock the system down, no changes, let me sleep on it. And then ... Replie asked the question: "Would you like me to prototype it?" I couldn't help myself. I was right back in. And the prototype, man, it was cool.</p>
<p>Also today, I'm NOT going to use Claude Opus 4 I burned through $300 yesterday in Max Max mode / Bankruptcy mode, but wasn't sure in the end it helped ... and it's definitely slower I assume slower was better, because it was really thinking through the actions ... but maybe not. Replie and I discussed and he said it was slowing us down, so for today, we'll revert to normal LLM, which all-in is also 1/7th the price and faster Let's see</p>
<p>Ok signing off Replit for the day Not a perfect day but a good one. Net net, I rebuilt our core pages and they seem to be working better. Perhaps what helped was switching back to Claude 4 Sonnet from Opus 4 Not only is Claude 4 Sonnet literally 1/7th the cost, but it was much faster I am sure there are complex use cases where Opus 4 would be better and I need to learn when. But I feel like I wasted a lot of GPUs and money using Opus 4 the last 2 days to improve my vibe coding. It was also much slower. I’m staying Team Claude 4 Sonnet until I learn better when to spend 7.5x as much as take 2x as long using Opus 4. Honestly maybe I even have this wrong. The LLM nomenclature is super confusing. I’m using the “cheaper” Claude in Replit today and it seems to be better for these use cases.</p>
