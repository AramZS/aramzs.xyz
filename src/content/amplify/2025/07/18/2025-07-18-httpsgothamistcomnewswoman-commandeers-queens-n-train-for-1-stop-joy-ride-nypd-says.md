<p>An unknown woman allegedly broke into a parked N train in Queens and took it for a joy ride before disappearing, police said Thursday.</p>
<p>This is at least the third train hijacking in under a year in Queens.</p>
<p>The transit tour de force took place at 4:30 a.m. and lasted only one stop, an NYPD spokesperson said. Officials said an unidentified woman with red dreadlocks was spotted entering the empty train at the Broadway station in Astoria and driving it to the 36th Street station before fleeing.</p>
<p>Train service was not affected, a spokesperson for the MTA said.</p>
<p>Authorities said someone working in a transit booth called 911. Police did not know how she gained access to the locked train.</p>
<p>Itâ€™s not the first time an unauthorized person took a train for a spin in Queens. Similar thefts allegedly took place in <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/police-bust-2-teens-in-queens-subway-joyride-mta-chief-says-hooligan-games-must-stop">Forest Hills</a> in January, again in September at the <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/teen-busted-in-alleged-queens-subway-joyride-nypd-says-her-accomplice-is-still-on-the-loose">Briarwood station</a> and again in January 2024 at the same <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/intruders-drove-empty-subway-cars-short-distance-in-queens-nypd">Forest Hills station</a>, according to police.</p>
<p>MTA officials previously said they would increase security at stations and install alarms to prevent future transit commandeering.</p>
<p>The agency declined to say if the train stolen Thursday was equipped with such an alarm.</p>
