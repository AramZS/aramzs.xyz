<p>Four people have died and more than 1,300 evacuated as torrential rain pounds South Korea, with authorities warning that the unseasonal deluge will continue.</p>
<p>Among those killed were two men in their 80s. Authorities believe one of them was trying to drain floodwaters from the basement of his home.</p>
<p>A third victim was crushed when a wall collapsed onto his car. Moments before, he'd called his wife to say the vehicle was "being swept away", authorities say. The fourth victim died of a cardiac arrest.</p>
<p>"I couldn't understand how something like this could happen," says Kim Ha-min, a cafe owner in the city of Gwangju. She says this is the first time she has experienced such heavy rain.</p>

<p>The record rainfall has prompted South Korea's government to raise the weather-related disaster alert to its highest level.</p>
<p>"Everything is covered by water except the roof [of my house]," a resident in one of the affected areas wrote online.</p>
<p>More than 400mm of rain poured down in just half a day in Seosan, the worst-affected city, along the country's west coast - the weather agency described it as a once-in-a-century event.</p>
<p>Photos and videos on social media show vehicles and homes submerged, with pieces of furniture floating in the water.</p>
<p>Ms Kim in Gwangju, which recorded 426mm of rainfall on Thursday, said she was scared because "I've never seen a flood here before, since there is no stream or river in this neighbourhood".</p>
<p>The 26-year-old had to shut her cafe after it was inundated by floodwaters: "I drained the water, but the smell from the sewers is so bad that I can't open for business."</p>

<p>Several injuries were reported across the country, including two people suffering from hypothermia and two others who sustained leg injuries.</p>
<p>As of 16:00 local time (07:00 GMT) on Thursday, more than 1,300 people had been evacuated.</p>
<p>Authorities have urged people to stay away from riverbanks, steep slopes and underground spaces, warning that the risk of landslides and flash floods remains high.</p>
<p>Dry air from the north-west mixed with hot and humid air from the south to form especially large rain clouds, South Korea's meteorological administration says.</p>
<p>But forecasters expect high temperatures to return next week, with the possibility of a heatwave.</p>
