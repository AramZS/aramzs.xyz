<p>The House on Thursday passed a bill setting up a regulatory framework for payment stablecoins, sending the cryptocurrency bill to President Trump’s desk and marking a major win for the industry.</p>
<p>Lawmakers voted 308-122 to pass the GENIUS Act following a <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5404233-house-gop-crypto-bills-rule/">tumultuous “crypto week”</a> in the chamber that saw competing GOP factions bring the House floor to a standstill for two days.</p>
<p>Twelve Republicans voted against the measure while 102 Democrats voted “yes.”</p>
<p>The bill regulating dollar-backed digital tokens now heads to Trump’s desk, where he has indicated he is eager to sign it.</p>
<p>The legislation’s future appeared in jeopardy less than 24 hours earlier.</p>
<p>A group of hard-line Republicans <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5402350-conservatives-procedural-vote-crypto-revolt/">tanked a procedural vote</a> on a trio of crypto bills Tuesday, freezing the floor.</p>
<p>President Trump <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5403176-trump-agreement-end-house-floor-revolt-crypto-bills/">struck a deal</a> to secure their support the next day, but several holdouts remained on Wednesday, as the House attempted once again to adopt a rule governing debate on the bills.</p>
<p>The agreement Trump reached with the hard-liners also prompted new backlash from members of the House Financial Services Committee.</p>
<p>The deal sought to add provisions from the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, which aims to bar the Federal Reserve from issuing a central bank digital currency (CBDC), to a broader crypto framework called the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act.</p>
<p>Earlier Wednesday, the House <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/technology/5406895-house-passes-crypto-market-structure-bill/">voted 294-134</a> to pass the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act. The anti-CBDC measure is up for consideration next.</p>
<p>After hours of deliberation on Wednesday — during which the rule vote remained open and the number of “no” votes from hard-liners continued to grow — GOP leadership reached a deal to add the anti-CBDC provisions to the National Defense Authorization Act.</p>
<p>Including the provisions in the must-pass legislation would put them on track to reach Trump’s desk, assuming they don’t get stripped out of the bill as it weaves its way through Congress later this year.</p>
<p>The agreement convinced most of the remaining holdouts to switch their “no” votes on the rule to “yes,” allowing it to pass after more than nine hours. It easily <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5405487-house-breaks-record-longest-vote-crypto-bills/">surpassed the previous record</a> for longest vote in the chamber, which the House set just two weeks earlier during consideration of the GOP’s “big, beautiful bill.”</p>
<p>The only Republican “no” vote that remained when they finally closed the vote late Wednesday night was Rep. <a href="https://thehill.com/people/marjorie-taylor-greene/">Marjorie Taylor Greene </a>(Ga.).</p>
<p>With the successful adoption of the rule, lawmakers were able to unfreeze the floor and unlock consideration of the crypto bills, including the GENIUS Act.</p>
<p>The final passage of the stablecoin bill represents a key win for the crypto industry, which has long sought legislation to provide greater regulatory clarity.</p>
<p>Trump, who has become a key ally of the industry in his second term, had urged House lawmakers to quickly pass a “clean” bill, frustrating hopes of tying it to crypto market structure legislation.</p>
<p>Some lawmakers had hoped to tie the two bills together in order to allow the House to put its stamp on crypto legislation and ensure Congress doesn’t lose momentum before getting to market structure.</p>
<p>Market structure legislation, which seeks to split up oversight of the industry between the Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission, is considered the centerpiece of crypto regulation.</p>
<p>The Senate has moved much slower on market structure legislation, frustrating the House. However, the upper chamber appears poised to soon release its own version of the bill.</p>
