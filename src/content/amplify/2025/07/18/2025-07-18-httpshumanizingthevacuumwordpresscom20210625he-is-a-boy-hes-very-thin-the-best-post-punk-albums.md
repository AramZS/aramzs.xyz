<p>Elastic if not brittle, genre descriptions rely on generational reassessment. I define post-punk as music inspired by the energy of punk but catholic by necessity and as amorphous as the tenuous articulations of its makers. Wire to my ears is the <i>sine qua non </i> for how a band follows a punk gesture with a post-punk fulfillment; the range of instrumental tones, the delight in vocal experiments, and the abstraction of the songwriting defined Wire at the same time that these phenomena kept them amiably deracinated, content to drift out of fashion and conversation.</p>
<p>A band whose debut (purchased on Columbia House!) I’d revisit with distant pleasure, The Raincoats seem more essential than ever, and after finishing Jenn Pelly’s excellent 33 1/3 book about that debut <a href="https://humanizingthevacuum.wordpress.com/2018/08/07/i-dont-wanna-be-in-your-family-tree-the-best-of-the-raincoats/">I sat down with the rest of the catalog</a>, falling hard for the mysterious, jovial <em>Odyshape</em>. This is an album that sounds as if three cool older friends invited you into their college dorm and delighted and made you uneasy with their shared jokes and collection of knickknacks.</p>
<p>For my purposes the post-punk era dies around 1982, absorbed by British New Pop, the remarkable groups arising from a Midwestern hardcore scene, and dwindling label interest; and I’m not interested in listing albums for history’s sake but as ever to catalogue my taste. Omissions noted.</p>
