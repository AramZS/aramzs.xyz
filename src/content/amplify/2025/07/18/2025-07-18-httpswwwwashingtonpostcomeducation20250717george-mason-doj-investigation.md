  Justice Department investigates George Mason University hiring - The
  Washington Post

<p>The Justice Department is examining the alleged use of race in hiring, the latest in a string of Trump administration probes into the Virginia university.</p>
<p>The U.S. Justice Department announced an investigation into the alleged use of race in hiring and promotions at George Mason University on Thursday, adding to a recent string of Trump administration probes into the institution.</p>
<p>The investigation is the third launched by the administration in recent weeks into the policies and practices at the Northern Virginia university, and the first inquiry into the school led by the Justice Department.</p>
<p>The escalating scrutiny follows a pattern that recently played out at the University of Virginia and comes amid the administration’s broader efforts to reshape American higher education.</p>
<p>In a news release Thursday, the Justice Department said the most recent investigation was sparked by statements and policies from George Mason’s president that suggest race and sex were used in hiring decisions to promote diversity.</p>
<p>The department alleges in the release that emails and internal documents show preferential treatment was given to candidates for hiring, promotion and tenure based on race or gender. The allegations echo those in a probe announced last week by the Education Department.</p>
<p>“It is unlawful and un-American to deny equal access to employment opportunities on the basis of race and sex,” said Assistant Attorney General Harmeet K. Dhillon of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division. “When employers screen out qualified candidates from the hiring process, they not only erode trust in our public institutions — they violate the law, and the Justice Department will investigate accordingly.”</p>
<p>George Mason spokesperson Paul Allvin declined to comment on Thursday evening, but referred The Washington Post to previous comments that the university does not discriminate based on race or otherwise and would work in “good faith” with the Education Department.</p>
<p>George Mason, once a commuter school, has rapidly grown to become the state’s largest public four-year university with more than 40,000 students.</p>
<p>Last week, the Education Department said it had opened a civil rights investigation into George Mason over the alleged use of race in the hiring and promotion of faculty members. And earlier this month, the department notified George Mason that it had launched an investigation into the university’s alleged failure to address a hostile environment for Jewish students and faculty.</p>
<p>George Mason was one of 60 universities to which the Education Department <a href="https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/us-department-of-educations-office-civil-rights-sends-letters-60-universities-under-investigation-antisemitic-discrimination-and-harassment">sent </a>letters in March over their handling of alleged antisemitism and harassment, and the university previously faced a probe under the Biden administration.</p>
<p>The Justice Department’s involvement echoes the Trump administration’s inquiries into the University of Virginia earlier this summer. In Charlottesville, Justice Department officials sent the flagship university<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/07/02/university-of-virginia-justice-department-investigation-letters/"> seven letters</a> over two months alleging a widening array of civil rights violations related to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) and antisemitism. The letters showed frustration toward the university for not properly respond to its requests.</p>
<p>The pressure campaign led to U-Va. President James E. Ryan’s <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/06/27/uva-president-submits-resignation-trump-justice/">resignation</a> late last month.</p>
<p>Allvin, the George Mason spokesperson, said last week that officials had learned lessons from the scrutiny of U-Va. and would devote “significant resources to make sure we don’t keep anybody waiting.”</p>
<p>Earlier this year, George Mason President Gregory Washington <a href="https://www.gmu.edu/news/2025-03/update-federal-requirements-president-washington">told</a> the university community that the school was meeting the requirements of federal mandates related to DEI while still remaining committed to a “core value” that “Diversity is our Strength.” Still, he said he renamed the university’s former DEI office as the Office of Access, Compliance and Community, saying the term DEI has “become so broadly misunderstood and misapplied as to become counterproductive to our work.”</p>
<p>The university’s governing board, whose current members were all appointed by Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin, considered but did not pass a resolution calling for the dismantling of DEI at the school. That consideration drew criticism from many liberal students and faculty members, who see those initiatives as making the school more welcoming.</p>
<p>The Trump administration has focused on institutions of higher education, threatening to cut federal funding to achieve policy goals. In recent months, it has frozen billions in funding at Harvard and other schools; reached a deal with the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/07/01/upenn-bars-transgender-athletes/">University of Pennsylvania</a> in which that school will bar transgender athletes from competing in women’s sports; and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/06/26/university-california-trump-dei-investigation-hiring-justice/">launched</a> an investigation into the University of California system over alleged race- or sex-based hiring.</p>
