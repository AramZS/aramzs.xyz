<p>A plastic surgeon who specialises in breast reconstruction for cancer survivors has claimed she is facing financial ruin after publicly criticising one of America’s largest health insurance companies.</p>
<p>Dr Elisabeth Potter claimed she was called out of surgery by a UnitedHealth representative in January and asked for “mundane details” about the patient’s diagnosis to justify the cost of the treatment.</p>
<p>That day, Potter posted a short clip to her social media accounts denouncing UnitedHealth’s business practices. “Insurance is out of control,” Potter said in the video, which has been viewed millions of times. “I have no other words.”</p>
<p>Potter, 49, told The Times that UnitedHealth had since refused to provide in-network coverage to her RedBud Surgery Centre in Austin, Texas, and she believes this was intended to punish her for speaking out.</p>
<p>With nearly $5 million in debts associated with establishing the clinic, Potter said she had been forced to sell her belongings and draw on family savings to keep it afloat. She set up a fundraising page and has since received thousands of donations from the public along with the backing of Bill Ackman, a billionaire hedge fund manager, who donated $100,000.</p>
<p>Ackman wrote in a post on X this week that Potter was being punished for exposing UnitedHealth’s “aggressive and abusive insurance practices”.</p>

<p>Eric Hausman, a UnitedHealth spokesman, denied Potter’s retaliation claims. He said that while Potter remained in the insurance network for its members, RedBud never had been.</p>
<p>“We informed Dr Potter on October 1 [last year] that our ambulatory surgery centre network was closed, well before any of the videos in question,” the spokesman said. “There has been no change in network status for her, or RedBud.”</p>
<p>In the privatised, fragmented US healthcare system, hospitals and clinics that provide same-day surgical care outside of a traditional hospital setting are known as ambulatory surgery centres. Many have formal “in-network” agreements with insurance companies where they cover up to 90 per cent of medical bills.</p>
<p>UnitedHealth has also disputed Potter’s claims the company forced her to step out of the surgery and rejected any implication that they risked the patient’s welfare.</p>
<p>Potter, who set up RedBud in December 2023, said that receiving an in-network designation was vital to the survival of her business. She said UnitedHealth stopped responding to her consultant’s attempts to have it classified as in-network only after the videos were published to social media.</p>
<p>“The argument that their network is ‘closed’ is proof that UnitedHealth controls everything,” Potter said.</p>
<p>The controversy began on January 7. Potter had been performing a double mastectomy on a breast cancer patient at St David’s Medical Centre in Austin when she claims she received an urgent message from a nurse asking her to call the woman’s health insurer.</p>
<p>Fearing that UnitedHealth might try to deny the patient’s coverage, Potter “scrubbed out” mid-surgery to phone them back, leaving the patient in the care of another surgeon. Potter emphasised there was no danger to the patient.</p>
<p>On the phone, Potter said a UnitedHealth representative told her they needed to know the patient’s diagnosis and the justification for the inpatient stay after surgery.</p>
<p>That day, Potter posted videos on TikTok, Instagram and X criticising the company for interrupting the surgery and, in her view, prioritising profits over patient care. The clips attracted thousands of comments from Americans disillusioned with the state of the healthcare industry.</p>
<p>“It was just completely absurd,” Potter said in an interview. “When I made the video, I had completed four breast reconstruction surgeries that day for women affected by breast cancer, all through insurance. And I walked out of the hospital and I just couldn’t believe that this is my life.”</p>
<p>In a statement in February, UnitedHealth blamed an error by staff at the hospital for Potter being called during the surgery.</p>
<p>A week later, Potter received a letter from Clare Locke, a law firm specialising in defamation, demanding that she retract the claims and apologise or face a lawsuit. The letter also said UnitedHealthcare never asked Potter to leave the surgery and gave her the option to call back at a more convenient time.</p>
<p>Clare Locke warned that the videos had attracted posts celebrating the murder of <a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/luigi-mangione-arraigned-federal-court-c768rlxn9">Brian Thompson</a>, the chief executive of the company’s health insurance division, and that the intense criticism risked inciting further violence.</p>

<p>Through a lawyer, Potter defended the accuracy of the videos and refused to remove them. UnitedHealth has not filed the threatened defamation action.</p>
<p>After the video went viral <a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/millionaires-flee-new-york-mamdani-zohran-qbrfnddx3">Ackman</a>, himself no stranger to social media controversies, told his two million followers on X that the Securities and Exchange Commission should investigate UnitedHealth. He later deleted the post, but after speaking to Potter and examining detailed patient information and call logs provided by her lawyer, he defended her again.</p>
<p>“I believe that Dr Potter told the truth,” Ackman posted in February, and accused the insurance company of “brazen attempts to silence” its critics.</p>
<p>Potter said Ackman, whom she has not met, had come to her defence when she felt she was battling America’s largest health insurance provider alone. “I can’t express what it feels like to be terrified and have somebody do something like that,” she said. “But I’m also equally touched by the fact that people are sending me their hard-earned money in this economy.”</p>

<p>Potter has performed more than 1,000 complex “flap” surgeries, which involve using the patient’s own tissue to rebuild breasts and can cost more than $100,000 without insurance.</p>
<p>She said regardless of the outcome of her battle with UnitedHealth, she was determined to continue treating <a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/cancer-breakthroughs-nhs-disease-0zdx06gxw">breast cancer</a> patients. “I’m taking a hit and it hurts,” she said. “But I am made of tougher stuff than this. They picked a fight with the wrong lady.”</p>
