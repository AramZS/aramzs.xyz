<p>Dear Priya <em>( The Epilogue )</em></p>
<p>You will probably never read this letter, I know you are far too busy eating ethnic foods and taking down the patriarchy. I am just a small bartender woman riding the hot subway to work, working on my feet for 14 hours a day and watching my savings account dwindle. But I am also a woman scorned. As a young girl growing up at a certain time, I was told to sit up straight with my hands in my lap and keep quiet. I’ve had boyfriends tell me my laugh was too loud and when I’m tipsy I talk too much. Of course if you keep quiet, you won't upset anyone or make waves, but then you might as well be a cardboard cut out of a human. I didn't create a substack to write about the same shit everyone else is, I came here to speak my mind and let my true feelings out.</p>
<p>The Le Veau d’or, New York Times review was my 4th review as a bar manager here in New York, Pete Wells has always been my reviewer, the man I feared, but the man I respected. When he announced his retirement at the beginning of last summer, I was sad but also scared. Who would replace him, who could replace him, who would review us? I'm not here to spin a beautiful poem about food and culture, I’m here to be petty. You don't know this but I am the bar manager of Le Vea d’Or. You could have known, because you wrote our New York Times review but you didn't take the time to ask.</p>
<p>Let’t talk about your first visit to Veau, you came with 2 small children and another woman. Unlike most restaurants, we love the company of children and babies in the dining room. The whole thing about LVD is that we have legacy guests who have been dining at the restaurant for years and we have first timers and young people. It's a true New York City melting pot. Of course the room is going to be louder, the crowd more diverse and the prices higher, this is not the supper club Le Veau d’Or has been for the last years, it’s an alive running restaurant. And a brand new one when you visited, with prices that support the 30 plus dishes on our food menu. We knew it was you the second you walked in, you sat on table 23, our staff was beyond kind to you and knew what was happening when you had the children ask all of your questions. We made mocktails, watched them gobble down frogs legs and treated you all like normal customers. But did you think for one minute that having a child ask who the wine person was, is normal and not totally insulting? We are grown ups, working in a grown up restaurant, this is not a side gig or hustle, this is my career, I have dedicated my life to this industry and now I have to be scared of someone under the age of 12 for a bad review in the goddamn New York Times?</p>
<p>On your second visit you came with a bit of an older crowd, you sat on Table 26 and we could see the judgment on their faces before they sat down. You were wearing a dollar store wig and we knew it was you immediately. Your server took your drink order ( wine by the glass and one cocktail) and one of your guests asked for a side of ice twice before the server even left the table. We were busy, we tried to act normal and treat you like everyone else, the one cocktail you ordered ( in my opinion) actually took too long to reach your table. I was fuking livid. We were nervous about this visit, it seemed like a table of people who wanted to hate us. At one point in the meal you took your wig half way off to scratch your head, I’m sure that synthetic hair was probably very itchy in the late summer heat. If this was a joke, you were only fooling yourself, not us.</p>
<p>I wasn't there for your third visit, I was hanging out with Carthusian Monks in Chartreuse, it was fab.</p>
<p>Your review came out, you gave us 2 stars, you talked about some dishes, tripe, duck and lobster, but didn't describe the dishes. You didn't talk about the variety, the “old schoolness” of the menu, the comforting service. You did talk about the wine list, curated by our wine director Jorge Riviera. A beloved figure in our industry, who has been highlighted and written about, even by the Times. But his name is Jorge <strong>Riera</strong>.  You described one of our desserts, a dish that no one has put on a menu in years as a sugary marshmallow cereal and thought that was a compliment. You spoke about the room and how it was loud and hard to get to the bathroom ( it is a 15 table restaurant with 5 bar stools and 2 bathrooms the size of a tiny coat closet) but you didn’t even mention that our Maitre’d is the grandson of the last owner Robert and that you spoke with his daughter Cathy ( she ran the restaurant after Robert passed) at length about the history of the space. This legacy lives on, in Derek and he knows so many of our “legacy guests” and greets them with genuine kindness and warmth.</p>
<p>Our bartenders and servers have been doing this for years, most of them have been managers, bar managers and wine directors. They don't have back servers, bussers, bar backs or runners, they do it all. Guess what we've had regulars from the moment we opened, an opening that took 5 years and their passion for this restaurant is palpable. We have 15 tables but we make more reservation dreams come true, more than you can ever imagine. Do you know I get hand written letters and post cards delivered to me at the restaurant, thanking me for their time at Veau? I have regular’s numbers in my phone where they can just text me, the servers hug so many guests as they lead them from their tables to the door. Our General manager is a bad ass, wine slinging, google doc wizard who made the best training manual I have ever seen and knows more about food than most line cooks. I waited 2 years to put the “Martini Our Way” on this menu ( You could have been one of the first to write about it) , finding the perfect two glasses took a fuking year, I dreamed of this cocktail list and the bartenders who would make them and cried. I’ve cried too many times, thinking of what we are privileged to do in this beautiful, historic space. Major turned 21 working the line, our table cloths are from France, our napkins, FOH jackets and plates are custom, all our check presenters are vintage puter and our matches are based off of the original design and take 3 months to make. The menu is based off of the original, we wrote a love letter to Le Veau d’Or without pretension and thinking of ourselves. You didn't notice any of it.</p>
<p>I won't even get started about the food and the chefs, we all know they are legends, they demand excellence and push the people that work for them to be better than excellent. They are New York, they understand the heart beat of New York, also writing Chef<strong> Lee</strong> instead of Chef <strong>Hanso</strong>n was hysterical, you should fire your fact checker or maybe your editor I don't know.</p>
<p>Maybe this is a love letter to my job and my staff, but you didn't see us, because you didn't want to see us, you leaned too heavily on the ideas of others and really godmanit I wish you spoke more about the food! I'm mad, I've been mad, this is my opinion, no one else's. If you really hated us and truly believe we sucked and wrote why with insight I would accept it and move on and get better.</p>

<p>I’ll probably get a lot of shit for this, but I don’t care.</p>
<p>But I expect more, I deserve more. Maybe Check out @carry_ bradshaw_ reviews. They get it.</p>
