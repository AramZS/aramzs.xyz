<p><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/defending-women-from-gender-ideology-extremism-and-restoring-biological-truth-to-the-federal-government/">Executive Order 14168</a>, one of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_executive_orders_in_the_second_presidency_of_Donald_Trump#January">many EOs signed on Inauguration Day</a>, forbids the <a href="https://www.state.gov/">State Department</a> from issuing passports to trans people with updated gender markers. (That’s not all—it does many other awful things—but this post is just about passports.) The <a href="https://www.aclu.org/">ACLU</a> is seeking to overturn this policy in <a href="https://www.aclu.org/cases/orr-v-trump">Orr v. Trump</a>. As <a href="https://tess.oconnor.cx/2025/02/114021367798537891">one of the people affected</a>, I have been closely following their case.</p>
<p>The plaintiffs secured <a href="https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/federal-judge-partially-blocks-trump-administration-policy-barring-updates-to-sex-designation-on-us-passports">a preliminary injunction</a> in mid-April which enabled each of them to update the gender marker on their passports. Two months later a federal judge <a href="https://tess.oconnor.cx/2025/06/class-status">granted class status</a> in the case, expanding the injunction to apply to all trans people seeking passport gender marker updates. The State Department, at least initially, chose to <a href="https://tess.oconnor.cx/2025/06/intentional-noncompliance">intentionally defy the court order</a>, but they eventually gave in in and <a href="https://www.erininthemorning.com/p/trump-admin-begins-processing-some">have processed some trans passport updates</a>.</p>
<p>The Passport Office is keeping track of every passport issued under the injunction. In a <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mad.280559/gov.uscourts.mad.280559.127.2.pdf">recent filing with the court</a>, Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary <a href="https://www.state.gov/biographies/ryan-m-dooley">Ryan Dooley</a> made it clear that the State Department will replace any passports issued under the injunction as soon as they’re allowed to. [<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/erininthemorning.com/post/3ltkvjbky7k22">Erin Reed</a>]</p>
<p>I travel frequently for work. I’ve already left the country a half a dozen times since <a href="https://tess.oconnor.cx/2025/02/114021367798537891">being issued</a> a passport with the wrong gender marker in February. Traveling with this passport makes me <a href="https://tess.oconnor.cx/2025/03/travel">demonstrably less safe</a> than I would be with one which matches my name and appearance.</p>
<p>I really want to avail myself of the opportunity this injunction presents, but I can’t afford to have my passport revoked out from under me at some unpredictable time, especially given my travel obligations. So I’m holding off.</p>
