<p>Thousands of workers who provide legal services to low-income people are preparing for a possible strike by the end of this week — joining the more than 400 already on the picket line seeking better pay for themselves and more resources for their clients amid steep federal funding cuts.</p>
<p>Lawyers and other staff at CAMBA, the Urban Justice Center and the <a href="https://nylag.org/2025-cba-updates/">New York Legal Assistance Group</a> walked off the job on Tuesday, joining workers at the Goddard Riverside Law Project who have been on strike since last Wednesday. The workers are represented by the Association of Legal Aid Attorneys-UAW Local 2325, which along with its parent union, the United Auto Workers, represents a majority of legal services workers in New York City.</p>
<p>All told, up to 2,000 workers — spread across several organizations representing defendants in immigration, criminal, housing and family court — are prepared to strike as soon as Friday, the union said. Among them is the Legal Aid Society, the union’s largest chapter at 1,100 members.</p>
<p>Many of the attorneys on strike represent people with cases pending in immigration court, where since May federal agents have <a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/2025/05/28/ice-arrests-migrants-26-federal-plaza-pastor/">detained people appearing for their scheduled hearings</a>, a practice that coincided with a dramatic <a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/2025/07/14/ice-migrant-arrests-trump-administration-deportations-data/">rise in overall immigration arrests in New York</a>, THE CITY has reported.</p>
<p>The organizations have not said how they are handling their case loads during the strike, but during last year’s weeks-long work stoppage at <a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/2024/03/19/mobilization-justice-strike-legal-services-uaw-negotiations/">Mobilization for Justice</a>, another UAW shop, non-union legal staff and managers filled in.</p>
<p>Union members and about a dozen state and local elected officials, including state Attorney General Letitia James and Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani, gathered in front of the courthouses at Manhattan’s Foley Square on Tuesday to push for a deal.</p>

<p>“When management says they can’t afford to meet your demands, we say we can’t afford to live like this and work like this any longer,” UAW Region 9A director Brandon Mancilla told the hundreds of union members gathered at the rally. “High-quality, high-level representation. It’s about time your employers and the city start valuing you.”</p>
<p>Though the specific demands vary among the organizations, they generally seek cost of living adjustments to pay, higher salary minimums for attorneys and other staff, and more affordable health care premiums. Some are also seeking a reduced case load cap per attorney to combat burnout and high turnover.</p>
<p>At the rally, union leaders renewed their calls for better pay and benefits, particularly for low-paid clerical workers, paralegals and social workers within their ranks. Some earn as little as $45,000 a year, noted Mancilla.</p>
<p>“We are overworked, we are underpaid, we are overlooked, and still we are committed. This work fills our hearts with joy, but we are drowning,” said Lowis Ortega, a family advocate with the Bronx Defenders, which authorized a strike beginning Friday if they do not reach a deal by then. “The representation of our clients will only improve if public interest workers are paid what they deserve.”</p>
<p>But they called on the city to tap into its <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/omb/reserves.page">$2 billion rainy-day fund</a> to boost funding for legal services. The budget deal linked by the City Council and the Adams administration last month <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/nyc-nearly-doubles-spending-on-immigration-legal-services">doubled spending</a> for immigration legal services and included investments <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/271-25/mayor-adams-releases-best-budget-ever-fiscal-year-2026-executive-budget-makes-significant#/0">totaling $30 million</a> for housing and criminal defense, but the union said those services need $25 to $30 million more in unrestricted funds for the next year in order to be adequately staffed.</p>
<p>The subsequent federal spending bill — which allocates an unprecedented <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ice-funding-big-beautiful-bill-trump-deportations/">$170 billion for immigration enforcement</a> and slashes funding the city relies on for housing, health care and other services — threatens to intensify the need for legal representation while shrinking city government resources.</p>
<p>Union leaders and rank-and-file members acknowledged the budget constraints looming over many nonprofits, including their employers, but called on them to join the union in calling on the Adams administration to increase funding for legal services.</p>
<p>Jane Fox, the head of the union’s Legal Aid Society chapter, said that management shares their view that more short-term city funding is needed.</p>
<p>“I can say that the Legal Aid Society has said to us that they — and again, they are trying to settle a contract — but they cannot go as far as we would like them to go, because they did not get enough funding from the city this year to meet our contract demands,” said Fox.</p>
<p>“They need to be pushing their political connections to make sure that Eric Adams knows exactly what is needed,,” she added.</p>
<p>Twyla Carter, the Legal Aid attorney-in-chief and chief executive, said in a statement that the organization is “looking forward” to resuming negotiations Wednesday and to “reach a fair agreement that recognizes the vital contributions of our staff attorneys and strengthens the long-term sustainability of a career” at the organization. She added Legal Aid will continue to operate in the event of a strike.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for Adams, Liz Garcia, pointed to the additional $20 million for criminal legal services providers secured in the latest city budget agreement.</p>
<p>“The Adams administration values the work that legal service providers do every day to advocate for vulnerable New Yorkers and ensure that they have access to legal representation and justice,” said Garcia.</p>
<p>“While the city is not an employer of these workers — and plays no role in their negotiations — we encourage all parties involved to resolve these issues as soon as possible so that New Yorkers can continue to depend on the crucial services they offer,” she added.</p>
<p>James, who is <a href="https://x.com/UAW/status/1942945264446161041">a former ALAA member</a> and was a picket captain during the <a href="https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1991/01/30/131491.html?pageNumber=28">1991 Legal Aid walkout</a>, also called on the city to tap into its reserves.</p>
<p>“I’ll never forget where I came from, and I will always be with UAW, and I will always be with all of you,” said James. “And I urge the city to reach into its reserves and pay you what you need.”</p>
<p>In recent years, the union has worked to ensure its chapters’ collective bargaining agreements expire at around the same time, which they say will give them maximum leverage in negotiations and help increase public pressure. It is the first time the union wielded such a sectoral approach in the legal services realm.</p>
<p>Among the organizations that could strike on Friday are Legal Aid, Bronx Defenders, the Office of the Appellate Defender, Appellate Advocates and the Center for Appellate Litigation.</p>
