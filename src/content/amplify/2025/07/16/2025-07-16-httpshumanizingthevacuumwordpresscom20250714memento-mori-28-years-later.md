<p><em>28 Years Later</em> is the first film I’ve seen where the filmmakers use a stack of skulls for pathos. When the director is Danny Boyle (<em>Trainspotting, Slumdog Millionaires</em>), who helmed <em>28 Days Later</em> more than two decades ago, and the screenwriter is longtime associate Alex Garland (<em>Civil War</em>), then it makes sense. Pitched at a more emotional key than its two predecessors, <em>28 Years Later</em> combines, uneasily, the euphoric and bathetic. This not a zombie film with pretensions to whatever you might call Art, but watching this 115-minute action flick we know we’re in the hands of a stylist of increasing visual sophistication, drawing upon influences as disparate as<em> Walkabout</em> and <em>Alien 3</em>, not to mention <em>Hamlet</em>.</p>
<p>A poster on the ILX message board compared <em>28 Years Later</em> to <em>Night of the Hunter</em> in its oneiric tone and the way it centers its narrative on a boy growing into experience. After a redundant framing device, Boyle and Garland introduce Spike (Alfie Williams), a 13-year-old stuck on the tidal island of Lindisfarne with his long-haired pa Jamie (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), ailing ma Isla (Jodie Comer), and a few hundred dirty ragamuffins whose fortress city, ever on the lookout for the Rave Virus, is protected by high tide when the sea covers the causeway. Lacking internet and other connections to modernity ever since Continental Europe quarantined the United Kingdom, the residents entertain themselves like medieval villagers. One past time they regard as a rite of passage: hiking over to the mainland to bag a zombie (“The more you kill, the easier it gets,” Jamie says with gusto). Fans of the earlier films will remember that only a sharp object to the neck or heart will kill one. The most fascinating and the scariest zombies are the oldest and most obese, crawling slowly on their nude bellies like habitués of one of Dante’s upper circles of hell as they slurp up worms, their only prey unless they inch close enough to a human. Spike and Jamie learn about Alphas, larger and stronger and better bearded zombies who have a charming habit of ripping the head and spinal cord of their victims in one piece.</p>
<p>It’s not like Spike needs more trauma. During the victory party back on Lindisfarne booze and high spirits drive Jamie into the arms of another woman. A devastated Spike flees with Isla back to the mainland in search of the famous Dr. Kelson (Ralph Fiennes). On the way they hook up with a Swedish NATO officer (Edvin Ryding) stranded when his quarantine patrol boat sinks and the zombies dispatch the survivors. Like <em>Children of Men, 28 Years Later</em> introduces a baby for pathos: a virus-free newborn whom Isla takes to heart. So does Kelson in his fashion. Doyle grants him a fabulous introduction: he paralyzes Samson, one of the Alphas, with a morphine dart. With its ringed spikes and skull memorials — Kelson takes the trouble to boil off the skin — his own redoubt looks like it survived a 1980s sword-and-sandal fantasy set.</p>
<p>The film’s unsteady gait suggests editing room decisions. Boyle intersperses clips from Hollywood versions of British history (Ivanhoe, the Battle of Agincourt) when the mythic virus gets in his blood. It builds towards a denied climax between Spike, Kelson, and the Alphas, or Spike and the Alphas. There’s the lateness with which Boyle introduces Kelson and the abruptness of his departure. Even Spike catching his beloved dad <em>in flagrante</em> has a “Meanwhile, back at Justice League headquarters…” reveal; but to give Doyle and Garland credit this bolsters the credibility of Spike’s child’s point-of-view, still reacting instinctively and without context.</p>
<p>I extend a similar amnesty towards <em>28 Years Later</em> — without a doubt the year’s oddest hit. It boasts the verities on which moviegoers can rely, like casting. Williams’ lack of child-actor histrionics is a relief: the film is about him and he rewards the concentration. A performer with whom I might chat about Hemingway’s short fiction at the bar, Taylor-Johnson does his most credible screen acting to date: bearish but not macho as a dad, so when he disappoints Spike it hurts. Ryding is fun in his brief screen time, all nerves and petulance. And Fiennes is Fiennes; in the tradition of aging UK actors he draws upon the pantheon of 20th century hams from Olivier to Burton. Covered in iodine (to ward off the infection), he looks like a Shakespearean king drenched in blood. Fiennes burrows so deeply into his own fantasyland that he invests phrases like “the magic of the placenta” with a demented pathos. Speaking of Shakespeare, Kelson’s meditation on the subtleties of <em>memento mori</em> gets the Old Vic treatment. And Anthony Dod Mantle’s camera regards the UK mainland where the characters are fated to travel with something like lust.</p>
<p>Finally, <em>28 Years Later</em> ends with enough loose ends to justify <em>28 Centuries Later</em>. Consider: Spike, awakening from a 100-year cryogenic sleep, realizes the infection still rages because a rancid and stupid lizard of a president has denied that the zombie plague exists in the first place. Not to worry, for a new band of rebels, armed with the latest weapons and as agile as X-Men, picks up the baton in the last few minutes. How they’re styled is one of Boyle and Garland’s little jokes; research after my screening answered my questions. The point is, this group looked it was having as much fun as the rest of us.</p>
