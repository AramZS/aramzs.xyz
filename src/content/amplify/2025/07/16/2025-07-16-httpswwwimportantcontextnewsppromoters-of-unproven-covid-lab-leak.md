<p><em>This piece has been updated from its original email version.</em></p>
<p>Three public health contrarians with ties to a fringe “biosafety” group have joined the National Institutes of Health, <em>Important Context </em>has learned.</p>
<p>Bryce Nickels, PhD, Edward Hammond, and Alex Washburne, PhD, are all vocal proponents of the narrative that the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19 was developed in and leaked from a laboratory. All have ties to a controversial group called Biosafety Now, which is dedicated to promoting the dubious origin story, and opposing so-called “gain-of-function” research—manipulation of viruses to understand their evolution, predict potential outbreaks, and even develop treatments—which they blame for causing the pandemic.</p>
<p>The group was co-founded by Nickels, a Rutgers University genetics professor, and his colleague, Rutgers microbiologist Richard Ebright, PhD. Hammond, who previously headed up his own group called the Sunshine Project dedicated to opposing biological warfare research through Freedom of Information Act requests, was once part of Biosafety Now’s <a href="https://x.com/biosafetynow/status/1630961836458639363?s=61">leadership team</a>. Washburne, a mathematical biologist, has <a href="https://biosafetynow.org/essays-by-alex-washburne/">written</a> several essays for the organization.</p>
<p>Biosafety Now has worked hand-in-hand with lab leak-supporting Republican leaders like Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY). Ebright <a href="https://biosafetynow.substack.com/p/richard-ebrights-testimony-on-the?utm_source=publication-search">testified</a> in support of the lab leak theory as a guest of Paul’s last June. That September, Nickels and BioSafety Now <a href="https://biosafetynow.substack.com/p/sign-the-petition-to-bring-the-risky">advocated</a> for Paul’s “Risky Research Review Act,” which would have established a review board to oversee research into potentially dangerous pathogens and products. Despite its prominence, the organization’s board of directors <a href="https://biosafetynow.org/team/">includes</a> no virologists—just Ebright, an artist, and a graduate student in applied physics.</p>
<p>The idea that COVID came from a lab has grown in popularity since <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/04/18/covid-lab-leak-theory-trump-replaces-pandemic-guidance-website-with-disputed-claims-alleged-coverup/">Donald Trump</a> began pushing the narrative back in 2020 as his reelection chances were dwindling amid the spiraling public health crisis. While originally popular mainly on the political Right, nearly <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/7-10-americans-think-covid-120000142.html">70 percent</a> of Americans today believe the story. The Trump White House has sought to solidify the lab leak as the official account of the pandemic’s origins, painting the president as a victim of unscrupulous public health officials who misled the public. In April, the White House replaced the covid.gov website with a page advocating the lab leak claim, and the following month, Trump signed an <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/05/05/nx-s1-5267612/trump-gain-of-function-research-funding">executive order</a> banning gain-of-function research.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, scientific evidence has <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abp8715">consistently</a> <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abp8337">pointed</a> <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2202871119">to</a> <a href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/msphere.00119-23">the</a> <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8373617/">pandemic</a> <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38631919/">having</a> <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(24)00901-2">natural origins</a>, with the SARS-CoV-2 virus spilling over to humans from animals. A <a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/27-06-2025-who-scientific-advisory-group-issues-report-on-origins-of-covid-19">report</a> released last month from the World Health Organization’s Scientific Advisory Group for the Origins of Novel Pathogen—a body of 27 independent, international, multidisciplinary experts—reaffirmed that assessment, finding no compelling evidence pointing to laboratory origins.</p>
<p>According to an official employee directory for the Department of Health and Human Services, lab leak enthusiasts <a href="https://directory.psc.gov/hhsdir/eeKey.asp?Key=25346">Nickels</a>, <a href="https://directory.psc.gov/hhsdir/eeKey.asp?Key=129895">Washburne</a>, and <a href="https://directory.psc.gov/hhsdir/eeKey.asp?Key=126864">Hammond</a> are all now working in the NIH’s Office of the Director (OD), Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, who hundreds of agency workers <a href="https://www.importantcontext.news/p/nih-workers-demand-changes-in-new">accused</a> last month, in a public “declaration,” of politicizing and undermining science. Their profiles list them as “non-government,” meaning they are not actually federal employees, just doing work for the agency. The three men are working in the OD’s Division of Program Coordination, Planning, and Strategic Initiatives, which oversees the NIH Common Fund, coordinating trans-NIH initiatives and research. While the DPCPSI does not have a direct role in overseeing biosafety, Hammond’s profile on X reads “Senior Science Policy Analyst for Biosafety at US NIH.”</p>
<p>These three lab leak proponents all have connections to Bhattacharya, who, along with now-Food and Drug Administration commissioner <a href="https://www.importantcontext.news/p/everything-you-need-to-know-about-cce?utm_source=publication-search">Dr. Marty Makary</a>, briefly served on the board of directors of BioSafety Now last year. The <a href="https://www.importantcontext.news/p/out-of-his-depth-sold-his-soul-clueless">embattled</a> NIH director has repeatedly endorsed the disfavored COVID origins story—including in last year’s <a href="https://www.importantcontext.news/p/trump-nih-pick-pushed-ivermectin?utm_source=publication-search">conspiracy-pushing film</a>, “COVID Collateral,” and at his first agency town hall in May, which saw <a href="https://www.importantcontext.news/p/i-believe-it-nih-director-pushes">a walkout</a> by several dozen staffers. As <em>Important Context</em> has previously <a href="https://www.importantcontext.news/p/i-believe-it-nih-director-pushes">reported</a>, Bhattacharya only began embracing the lab leak after the public reveal of an email exchange between Dr. Francis Collins, former head of the NIH, and Dr. Anthony Fauci, the former head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, in which the former called for a published rebuke of his Great Barrington Declaration.</p>
<p>Bhattacharya has worked closely with Nickels. They co-authored a lab leak-pushing <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/07/20/opinion/science-should-never-try-and-triumph-over-nature/">piece</a> titled “Science should never try to triumph over nature” for the right-wing <em>New York Post</em> last July. In September the pair <a href="https://sciencefromthefringe.substack.com/p/welcome-to-science-from-the-fringe?utm_source=profile&amp;utm_medium=reader2">launched</a> a Substack called “Science From the Fringe,” which has been co-published by BioSafety Now’s Substack on multiple occasions. They marketed their “Fringe” outlet as dedicated to “open, respectful dialogue on critical issues in science, health policy, biosafety, and bioethics.” Following the announcement of Bhattacharya’s nomination for the NIH director position, Nickels penned a <a href="https://biosafetynow.substack.com/p/biosafety-now-congratulates-board">glowing tribute</a> to the health economist for BioSafety Now’s Substack.</p>
<p>Washburne has also been a fan of Bhattacharya’s for some time. He published a <a href="https://alexwasburne.substack.com/p/the-grace-of-dr-jay">piece</a> titled “The Grace of Dr. Jay” for his own Substack in December prior to confirmation hearings. Washburne has praised the <a href="https://www.exposedbycmd.org/2021/12/22/how-the-koch-network-hijacked-the-war-on-covid/">Great Barrington Declaration</a>, a document the NIH director co-authored in 2020 advocating for a COVID herd immunity strategy based on mass infection of the healthy population. The declaration plan was called out as dangerous and unscientific by major public health organizations and the WHO director-general but was embraced by the business-aligned Right.</p>
<p>Washburne’s ascendence appears to be tied to a controversial pre-print he co-authored in 2022 which argued for a lab origin of SARS CoV-2. While the paper, which has yet to be properly published, has received <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2022-10-scientific-response-sars-cov-.html">significant</a> <a href="https://www.bacpop.org/blog/synthetic/">criticism</a> <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9937728/">from the scientific community</a>, it has been embraced by powerful forces on the Right. The Heritage Foundation, the far-right think tank behind Project 2025, has amplified his pre-print on multiple occasions. They cited it in their “<a href="https://www.heritage.org/health-care-reform/report/forging-post-pandemic-policy-agenda-road-map-covid-19-congressional">road map</a>” for a congressional COVID inquiry, published in January 2023—a month ahead of the first hearing of the GOP-led House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic (HSSCP), which featured Bhattacharya and Makary as experts for the Republicans—and again in their July 2024 <a href="https://www.heritage.org/china/report/holding-china-accountable-its-role-the-most-catastrophic-pandemic-our-time-covid-19">report</a> from their own commission on China and COVID.</p>
<p>The Heritage “road map” listed “suppression” of scientific dissent from Bhattacharya and his discredited Great Barrington Declaration co-authors alongside “veiling” of COVID origins as key weaknesses in the US pandemic response. In its final <a href="https://oversight.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024.12.04-SSCP-FINAL-REPORT-ANS.pdf">report</a>, published in December 2024, HSSCP called the lab leak “likely” and claimed Fauci sought to cover it up. While claims of “silencing” and “censorship” have been central to the lab leak narrative and herd immunity pushers, Washburne, Nickels, Hammond and Bhattacharya co-signed BioSafety Now’s Substack <a href="https://biosafetynow.substack.com/t/letters">open letters</a> unsuccessfully calling for retractions of scientific papers supporting the natural origins of COVID—one in <a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/biosafetynow/p/covid-origins-proximal-origins-retraction?r=ev8g&amp;utm_medium=ios">2023</a> and <a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/biosafetynow/p/covid-origins-proximal-origins-retraction-daf?r=ev8g&amp;utm_medium=ios">three</a> <a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/biosafetynow/p/covid-origins-worobey-et-al-2022?r=ev8g&amp;utm_medium=ios">more</a> <a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/biosafetynow/p/covid-origins-liu-et-al-2020-retraction?r=ev8g&amp;utm_medium=ios">in 2024</a>.</p>
<p>Last August, Washburne and Nickels participated in a panel discussion on COVID origins at a pandemic policy conference that Bhattacharya organized at Stanford University. The panel was <a href="https://www.importantcontext.news/p/stanford-university-to-welcome-fringe?utm_source=publication-search">moderated</a> by a reporter from the pro-Trump, conspiracy-peddling <em>Epoch Times</em>.</p>
<p>The event was widely <a href="https://www.importantcontext.news/p/embarrassing-and-disappointing-stanford">criticized</a> for its heavy representation of fringe and anti-vaccine voices. At the time, there was some speculation among public health observers that the conference might be a proving ground for contrarians looking to get in on Trump’s second term. To wit, the <a href="https://healthpolicy.fsi.stanford.edu/events/pandemic-policy-planning-future-assessing-past">speaker list</a> included a number of individuals now working in the administration. Along with Bhattacharya, Nickels, and Washburne, there were Makary and <a href="https://www.importantcontext.news/p/vinay-prasad-named-fda-vaccine-chief?utm_source=publication-search">Dr. Vinay Prasad</a>, now head of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research.</p>
<p>Experts <em>Important Context</em> spoke with expressed alarm at the new NIH workers, explaining that they lacked the requisite experience for their roles and were ideologically extreme.</p>
<p>Virologist and AJI scientific advisor Angela Rasmussen, PhD, for example, noted that only Washburne—a recent PhD—had done virology research, but nothing with live viruses or related to biosafety.</p>
<p>“By putting researchers in situations where inadequate or poorly conceived biosafety policies are being enforced by regulators who are insufficiently experienced with this type of research, risk assessments will be inaccurate and risks will be insufficiently mitigated,” Rasmussen explained. “These policy advisors were chosen for their hostility toward virology and vaccine research, not their expertise or commitment to biosafety.”</p>
<p>“This squad of hobbyists and zealots actually increases the likelihood of a lab leak resulting from NIH-funded research,” she added.</p>
<p>Immunologist Gigi Gronvall, PhD, a Senior Associate at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security and visiting faculty at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, had similar concerns, having interacted with Nickels and having known Hammond for over two decades. She noted that she was especially surprised by the latter working at NIH, explaining he “doesn’t have the professional background one would expect for this role, even aside his opinions.”</p>
<p>“Bryce and Ed are zealots—very anti- virology research, they see the world in black and white, they do not understand biosafety, having never been responsible for practicing it or teaching it (despite naming their group Biosafety Now), and they see all virology research as risky,” she said. “This is very dangerous because in their roles at NIH, I think they could do even more damage than is already being done by the [executive orders] and lack of funding. We have serious viral threats that won’t solve themselves by putting our collective heads in the sand, but these people aren’t going to help up prepare for them or understand what we are dealing with.”</p>
<p>Nickels has <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/lab-leak-proponents-rutgers-accused-defaming-and-intimidating-covid-19-origin">earned a reputation</a> for online combativeness. He has a history of attacking researchers whose work supports natural origins for COVID and was even the subject of a <a href="https://www.science.org/do/10.1126/science.znoov39/full/_2024.03.13_formalcomplainttorutgers-1734550932823.pdf">formal complaint</a> at Rutgers, which alleged that he and Ebright had violated the school’s free expression policies by posting “provably false” and defamatory remarks online about a dozen scientists, potentially putting their safety at risk.</p>
<p>One of Nickels’ targets has been Fauci. He has called for the former public health official to be prosecuted for “<a href="https://x.com/bryce_nickels/status/1853917398057001009?s=61">perjury</a>” and lamented that President Biden pardoned him amid growing right-wing attacks. He also appeared in the <a href="https://www.the-gallop.com/from-fauci-to-fiction-doc-promises-covid-origins-delivers-hiv-lies/">conspiracy-fueled</a> film “Thank You, Dr. Fauci,” a Tucker Carlson Network exclusive, which suggested that COVID, HIV, Ebola, and Lyme disease were all the result of gain-of-function research and lab leaks. Nickels <a href="https://x.com/bryce_nickels/status/1860775009943237107?s=61">boosted</a> the film, alleging that there was a media and government conspiracy to suppress the truth about the pandemic.</p>
<p>Hammond was similarly outraged by the Fauci pardon, <a href="https://x.com/pricklyresearch/status/1881362221365920244?s=61">writing</a>, “There have been many disgraceful pardons but the worst ones I remember relate to financial crimes. As terrible as those can be, they don't rise to the level of Fauci's potential culpability in relation to gain of function research that caused the pandemic.”</p>
<p>Like Nickels, Hammond also has a reputation for pugilistic encounters with virologists. Shortly after AJI launched, he sent multiple emails to members of our board of directors suggesting our group had been ethically compromised due to the involvement of Dr. Peter Daszak—whose former group, EcoHealth Alliance, has been the subject of lab leak conspiracy theories as the alleged funder of the pandemic-causing gain-of-function research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology—and several of our scientific advisors, including Rasmussen, who he said was “nothing but a mouth (and a dirty one at that).”</p>
<p>He also left several comments on our BlueSky posts. His account has since been deleted.</p>
