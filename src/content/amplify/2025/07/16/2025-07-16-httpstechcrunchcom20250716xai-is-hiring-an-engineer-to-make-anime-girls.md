title: xAI is hiring an engineer to make anime girls
---
<p>Elon Musk’s xAI just released its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/15/of-course-groks-ai-companions-want-to-have-sex-and-burn-down-schools/">AI companions</a>, which include the goth waifu Ani and the homicidal red panda Bad Rudy. If you want to get in on that, you’re in luck: The company is hiring for the role of “<a href="https://x.com/i/jobs/1945257330012250112">Fullstack Engineer – Waifus</a>,” or, creating AI-powered anime girls for people to fall in love with.</p>
<p>This job is, to quote the listing, part of xAI’s mission to “create AI systems that can accurately understand the universe and aid humanity in the pursuit of knowledge.”</p>
<p>Right now, that accurate understanding of the universe includes understanding how to create a submissive, pocket-size girlfriend that will capture users’ hearts and wallets.</p>
<p>xAI has dozens of roles open at the moment, so we can’t say that the company is putting all of its eggs in the waifu basket. But we can probably expect Ani to get some friends in the future.</p>
