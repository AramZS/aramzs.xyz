<p>Democrats currently control 12 of Texas’s 38 congressional districts. A 13th district anchored by downtown Houston is currently vacant but was controlled by Democrats until <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/05/texas-democrat-sylvester-turner-dies-00213068">the death of Rep. Sylvester Turner last March</a>.</p>
<p>Putting more Republican voters in Democratic districts would make those races more competitive, but it also removes those voters from their current Republican districts, diluting the GOP advantage. Those shifts could create the potential for Democrats to win more seats in Texas than they otherwise might.</p>
<p>“They are playing a little bit of roulette with these maps,” said Rep. Julie Johnson (D-Texas). “In a wave election like what we have a potential opportunity for in ‘26, I think it makes these Republicans very vulnerable.”</p>
<p>Trump’s allusion to “other states” likely includes Ohio, which is required by law to draw new congressional maps this year and could give Republicans up to three more seats. It is unclear which other states he sees as opportunities for midterm pickups.</p>
<p>Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) said while members of Congress have “no voice” in creating new district maps, it might be of interest to conduct a new census before new lines were drawn. The Constitution requires a decennial census that is the basis for congressional apportionment. It typically takes years to both plan and execute a census.</p>
<p>“The numbers are kind of different than they were in 2020,” he said.</p>
