<p>Ed Davey called out the BBC for ‘not exposing’ Nigel Farage during his appearances on the broadcaster.</p>
<p>During an interview on BBC Breakfast, the Lib Dem leader said he was ‘really worried’ about what Farage could do to the UK, accusing him of ‘no solutions.’</p>
<p>Davey called for Farage to be ‘exposed’ for his bluster, and hit out at the broadcaster for failing to do this when he is interviewed by the broadcaster.</p>

<p>When Jon Kay objected to this suggestion, Davey didn’t back down and perfectly dismantled their treatment of Farage.</p>
<p>He said the broadcaster only covers the ‘tittle tattle’ around Reform instead of analysing their actual policies.</p>
<p>Davey finished by saying that on the whole, Farage gets an ‘easy ride’ whenever he appears on the BBC.</p>
<p>You can watch the full exchange below.</p>
<p>Recently, senior Lib Dem MP Max Wilkinson filed a complaint with OFCOM over the BBC’s coverage of Reform and Farage.</p>
<p>In a report to the broadcasting watchdog, Wilkinson argued Reform are now receiving disproportionate coverage from the Beeb. Despite only having five MPs, critics argue that the right-leaning organisation is given more air-time than any other party.</p>
<p>In particular, the MP complained about the BBC airing GB News footage of Farage on a boat trip in the Channel to watch migrant boats. Wilkinson accused the BBC of giving “undue prominence” and “disproportionate coverage” to Reform.</p>
