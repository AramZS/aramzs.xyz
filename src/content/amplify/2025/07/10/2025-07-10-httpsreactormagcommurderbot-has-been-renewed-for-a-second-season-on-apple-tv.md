<p>Please pause your <a href="https://reactormag.com/the-murderbot-series-is-kinda-two-shows-in-one/">binge watch of <em>Sanctuary Moon</em></a> for one second: We have exciting news! <em>Murderbot</em>, Apple TV+’s adaptation of Martha Wells’ beloved series, has been renewed for a second season!</p>
<p>“We’re so grateful for the response that <em>Murderbot</em> has received, and delighted that we’re getting to go back to Martha Wells’ world to work with Alexander [Skarsgård], Apple, CBS Studios and the rest of the team,” creators, <a href="https://reactormag.com/murderbot-showrunners-chris-paul-weitz-on-how-david-lynch-evoked-their-take-on-sanctuary-moon/">directors and executive producers Chris and Paul Weitz</a> said in a statement.</p>
<p>“Chris, Paul, Alexander and the entire <em>Murderbot</em> team have delivered a brilliantly original, addictive, witty and vibrant adaptation that has captured the imagination of audiences everywhere,” added Matt Cherniss, head of programming, Apple TV+. “We can’t wait to unveil what’s next for Murderbot and, of course, <em>Sanctuary Moon</em> in season two.”</p>
<p>The first season of the show, which has its season finale premiering tomorrow, on July 11, follows Wells’ first novella, <em>All Systems Red</em>. Alexander Skarsgård plays the titular Muderbot and the series also stars Noma Dumezweni (<em>Presumed Innocent</em>), David Dastmalchian (<em>Late Night with The Devil</em>), Sabrina Wu (<em>Joy Ride</em>), <a href="https://reactormag.com/murderbots-ratthi-dr-bharadwaj-actors-talk-preservation-teams-dance-moves/">Akshaye Khanna (<em>Critical Incident</em>), Tamara Podemski (<em>Outer Range</em>)</a>, and Tattiawna Jones (<em>The Handmaid’s Tale</em>).</p>
<p>We don’t have details what season two will cover, but odds are good that it will involve Martha Wells’ second book in the series, <em>Artificial Condition. </em>And if you need more Murderbot before then, Wells has got you! Reactor will be posting <a href="https://reactormag.com/read-a-new-murderbot-story-for-free-right-after-the-season-finale/">a new Murderbot novelette (for free!)</a> after tomorrow’s season finale.</p>
