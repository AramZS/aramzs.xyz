  Vinyl has long been the big story in physical media, but CDs are cheaper,
  quicker to manufacture, and poised for a comeback.

<p>At Begyle Brewing on Sunday, June 8, the Chicago Independent Radio Project hosted its third CD Blowout Sale. CHIRP founder and general manager Shawn Campbell says the sale’s debut in May 2022 was a way for CHIRP to get back into hosting public gatherings after the arrival of COVID. It had to be outdoors, and it had to be a lighter lift than the big annual CHIRP Record Fair &amp; Other Delights, which took at least six months to plan (and which <a href="https://chicagoreader.com/music/gossip-wolf/sunshy-comes-next-chirp-record-fair/">ended its 20-year run in November</a>). CHIRP has a <em>lot</em> of CDs, and the CD Blowout Sale was also a way to do something useful with them.</p>
<p>The station has collected CD donations since its inception, and every Record Fair featured CHIRP tables overflowing with cheap CDs. CHIRP hosted the first Blowout Sale at Burning Bush Brewery, down the block from its headquarters, and because it was free to browse, attendees came and went as they pleased. Despite the casual vibe, Campbell could see that people still liked CDs. But nothing prepared her for the response to this year’s CD Blowout Sale.</p>
<p>“There was a line waiting for us to open,” Campbell says. “We did it from two till six. For the first three hours, it was packed, and then the last hour, it opened up a little bit. But I feel like it was the last hour where we had people who had been shopping all day who were coming to us with stacks of, like, 70 CDs.”</p>
<p>Prepackaged boxes of ten CDs cost $1, and the most expensive discs were $3. All proceeds went to CHIRP, which raised about $5,000. “Clearly,” Campbell says, “people are hungry for CDs.”</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>“It’s certainly not back to the 1990s style of CD consumption. But the younger kids are buying lots and lots of CDs these days.”</p>Colin Blanton, Reckless Records</blockquote></figure>
<p>I never stopped buying CDs, both because of my job and because of my approach to collecting: If it can play music and the price is right, I’ll pick it up. I prefer any physical format to streaming, which often feels like dunking my head in a slop bucket. Lately, what’s drawn me to CDs has been the cost. After I became a father last year, my budget for music shrank, but my appetite for it didn’t. CDs are consistently cheaper than vinyl. In October, when Superior Viaduct announced preorders for the 2024 <a href="https://chicagoreader.com/music/concert-preview/cindy-lee-empty-bottle/">Cindy Lee album</a> <em>Diamond Jubilee</em>, I picked up the $24 double CD, which cost less than half as much as the triple LP.</p>
<p>I know I’m not the only one buying new CDs. In <a href="https://www.billboard.com/pro/taylor-swift-blackpink-selling-cds-vinyl-price-spikes/">April 2023, <em>Billboard</em></a> noted a 2.5 percent increase in CD sales in the first ten weeks of the year, compared to the same period in 2022. That uptick resulted in 6.9 million CD sales over those ten weeks, competitive with vinyl but still a drop in the bucket compared to the hundreds of millions of CDs sold annually in the late 90s. The format will likely never return to those pre-Napster heights, when CDs made up more than 90 percent of music sales, but consumer habits have started to change.</p>
<p>“I would say, maybe a decade ago CDs were a bit more niche, as far as something that collectors would go after—there’s definitely a specific breed of CD collector out there,” says Colin Blanton, who processes used CDs for Reckless Records in Wicker Park. “I think desirability has changed over time. On a more, like, mainstream scale, it’s certainly not back to the 1990s style of CD consumption. But the younger kids are buying lots and lots of CDs these days.”</p>

<p><sup>Kevin King sees releasing on CD as a way to exercise artistic autonomy.</sup></p>
<p>Young people are also releasing music on CD. In February, jazz trio the Kevin King Regime self-released their debut album, <em>Call to Action!</em>, on CD and as a Bandcamp download. Bandleader and saxophonist Kevin King sees CDs as a way of claiming more agency over his musical career. “I think it’s really cool that we have the choice to say, ‘Hey, we’re not gonna put this on streaming services. We’re not gonna put this on vinyl,’” he says. “It’s really cool to have that choice as young artists and really promote our views through every aspect of the music—not just the playing, not just the creation of it, but in the distribution of it as well.”</p>
<p>Anecdotes aren’t data, of course, but in recent years I’ve noticed more emerging local artists and labels selling CDs. Dance label <a href="https://chicagoreader.com/music/gossip-wolf/dorothy-carlos-high-spirits-yearning/">Yearning debuted in 2023</a> with the various-artists compilation <em>Yearning for Beauty</em>, issued on CD-R in an edition of 60. The label has since released three more CD-Rs, all of which have also sold out. In February, arty experimental dance duo Easygoingtech issued their self-titled debut on CD and sold out their first run of 100 CDs <a href="https://www.instagram.com/easyg0ingtech/p/DFrUxIsxXv0/?img_index=1">within 24 hours</a>. These numbers won’t move the needle nationally, but they’re evidence that people who care about supporting the underground Chicago scene see CDs as a meaningful way to do so.</p>
<p>Pelican guitarist Laurent Schroeder-Lebec never got hooked on purely digital music, whether downloaded or streamed, and he never stopped collecting CDs, cassettes, and vinyl. Five years ago, he noticed a shift in how music culture engaged with physical media. “COVID upended a lot of things for a lot of people in regards to all three of the leading musical formats,” he says. With shows on hold, music fans showed love for their favorite acts by buying merch.</p>
<p><strong><strong>Pelican, Coalesce, Porcelain</strong><br/>

<figure><p class="rw-outer-content"><span>Some content could not be imported from the original document.</span> <a href="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3945547930/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=333333/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/">View content ↗ </a></p></figure>
<p><sup>Pelican have noticed more fans showing off CD copies of their new album on social media.</sup></p>
<p>Vinyl still accounted for a lot of sales—41.3 million units in 2022, <a href="https://www.riaa.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2022-Year-End-Music-Industry-Revenue-Report.pdf">according to the Recording Industry Association of America</a>, compared to 33.4 million CDs. That strained the country’s vinyl-pressing plants, so that musicians sometimes waited a year for their new record to get pressed. Fans could preorder an LP that would take months to arrive, or they could buy a cassette or CD they’d get in days. CDs began to look a little more attractive. Though vinyl’s share of physical-media sales has been increasing for years (in 2022 it passed CDs for the first time since 1987), data collected since then suggests that the growth of the gap is slowing.</p>
<p>Pelican never stopped putting out albums on CD. When Run for Cover <a href="https://chicagoreader.com/music/chicago-record-report/dawid-nefertari-bandini-bussy-kween-pelican-cosmos-winter/">released <em>Flickering Resonance</em> in May</a>, Schroeder-Lebec noticed something different about the way Pelican fans celebrated its arrival. “It’s unusual for me to see Instagram stories of people being like, ‘Finally got the new Pelican!’ and it’s a copy of the CD,” he says. “[Before now,] nobody would’ve done that. It would’ve been, like, ‘Finally got the record on my favorite color.’ CDs are just, like, the format.” Run for Cover has leaned in too, selling 30-CD wallets with the label’s logo, some of them preloaded with five of the label’s releases. <a href="https://runforcoverrecords.com/products/cd-case-starter-pack-new-from-rfc?_pos=9&amp;_sid=fddc656bd&amp;_ss=r">One option</a> includes <em>Flickering Resonance</em> and <a href="https://chicagoreader.com/music/concert-preview/advance-base-color-club/"><em>Horrible Occurrences</em></a> by Chicago indie-pop project <a href="https://chicagoreader.com/music/gossip-wolf/advance-base-bridgeport-sessions-ramova-tv-buddha/">Advance Base</a>.</p>
<p>Many of the people I spoke with about CDs see the value in every format. “It matters a lot to me to have a physical incarnation of music,” says Maxwell Allison, aka <a href="https://chicagoreader.com/music/mukqs-documents-pandemic-living-on-my-most-personal-album-to-date/">experimental producer Mukqs</a>. “I’ve got 900 vinyl records in our home. I’ve got a similar amount of CDs and tapes. CDs are such a nice middle ground—the Goldilocks of physical media. A tape, I love its compact nature. I love being able to line up a ton of tapes on the wall and select them and pop them into the deck. With a vinyl record, you have a flat square, and it takes up a lot of space, but it gives you the perfect large-scale opportunity to look at the art and admire the physical product. With the CD, it’s right in between those things. It doesn’t take up too much space, but it still has enough surface area to make substantial art.”</p>
<figure><p class="rw-outer-content"><span>Some content could not be imported from the original document.</span> <a href="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3918582994/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=333333/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/">View content ↗ </a></p></figure>
<p>The CD is now a vintage format. More than 22 years have passed since Apple launched the iTunes Music Store, a key moment in the music industry’s slow embrace of its digital future and the CD’s cultural decline. Signs of the format’s ubiquity—CD drives in computers, CD decks in cars, the Sony Discman—disappeared piecemeal over the ensuing decades. (You could buy a new Chevy Express van with a CD player <a href="https://gmauthority.com/blog/2021/07/2022-chevy-express-and-gmc-savana-to-drop-cd-player-option/">as recently as 2021</a>.) CDs themselves have never been scarce, but when the market for CD players collapsed, it got hard to find anything but cheap crap or inaccessible audiophile equipment. “Where’s the consumer-priced, nice CD player?” asks Alex York, who owns Torn Light Records with Dan Buckley. “That’s the problem.”</p>
<p>York says Torn Light sells about 500 CDs a week on average. “I’m selling CDs to mostly, majority, people in their 20s,” York says. “College kids, especially with groceries and rent being the way they are, they still want to go out and buy something for themselves. They can’t afford the $38 double LP of an Elliott Smith record—that’s my example, because that’s the CD I sell the most to college kids. . . . You only have 30 bucks to spend. Grab two albums, you know?”</p>
<p>Torn Light also releases music on vinyl and CD. In April, the shop’s label pressed 300 CD copies of <em>The Other World</em> by experimental musician Michael Vallera (Cleared, Luggage). York knows how CDs work, because he’s the logistics and product coordinator for Clandestine Label Services. (The founders of New York label Northern Spy founded Clandestine in 2010, and York and Dan Buckley have since bought in as co-owners.) This puts him in a good position to guide labels through the process of manufacturing CDs.</p>
<p>“We just got back from a work trip where we met up with some of the manufacturers on the east coast,” York says. “We met up with label managers from 4AD, Warp—legendary underground indie labels. One of their biggest takeaways from our big meeting was, ‘Don’t underestimate the CD.’”</p>
<p>The meeting also gave York a chance to ask 4AD about stock for the shop. “I was like, ‘It would be nice if I could have every Cocteau Twins album [that’s] out on CD,’” York says. “They’re like, ‘We can’t keep them in print. We’ll make a couple thousand, and then they’re gone in a couple weeks.’ It’s like the 90s again. It’s good for the record labels and the bands. CDs cost nothing to manufacture. Now there’s eco-friendly ways to make them; they’re using recycled plastics.”</p>
<p>York is a real believer in CDs—they draw him in at other record stores. “I don’t even look at records,” he says. “There’s too many already. I could look at the wall and go, ‘Oh, some [first-pressing] acid folk from 1970 from the UK,’ and it’s $1,700. I’ll never buy that, but I do want to hear it. I’ll gladly go buy a CD copy for $13.”</p>
