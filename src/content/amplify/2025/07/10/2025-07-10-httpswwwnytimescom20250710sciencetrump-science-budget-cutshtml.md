<p>President Trump’s budget plan guts federal science funding for the next fiscal year, according to an overview published by an external group. Particularly at risk is the category of basic research — the blue-sky variety meant to push back the frontiers of human knowledge and sow practical spinoffs and breakthroughs in such everyday fields as health care and artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>The group says it would fall by more than one-third.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.aaas.org/news/fy-2026-rd-appropriations-dashboard">new analysis</a>, made public Wednesday by the American Association for the Advancement of Science, a general scientific society based in Washington, D.C., added up cuts to the budgets of hundreds of federal agencies and programs that do scientific research or provide grants to universities and research bodies. It then compared the funding appropriated for the current fiscal year with the administration’s proposals for fiscal year 2026.</p>
<p>For basic science research, the association reported that the overall budget would fall to $30 billion from $45 billion, a drop of roughly 34 percent. For science funding overall — which includes money for basic, applied and developmental work, as well as for facilities for research and development — the analysis found that the federal budget would fall to $154 billion from $198 billion, a drop of 22 percent.</p>
<p>The new analysis shows that the Trump administration’s budget plan, if adopted, “would essentially end America’s longstanding role as the world leader in science and innovation,” said Toby Smith, senior vice president for government relations and public policy at the Association of American Universities.</p>
<p>His group, Mr. Smith added, is working with Congress to develop “a funding plan for strategic investment that would help to sustain continued American scientific leadership rather than destroying it.”</p>
<p>Mary Woolley, president of Research America, a nonprofit group that promotes science, said the new analysis showed that the budget plan “is threatening not only science but the American public. If approved by Congress, it will make the public less safe, poorer and sicker.”</p>
<p>Victoria LaCivita, a spokeswoman for the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, did not reply to a request for comment on the new analysis.</p>
<p>In early May, the White House unveiled a budget blueprint that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/05/02/us/trump-budget-2026#science-backers-say-proposed-science-cuts-pose-dire-risks">listed proposed cuts</a> to a handful of science agencies. For instance, it sought a reduction in the budget of the National Science Foundation, which sponsors much basic research, to $3.9 billion from $8.8 billion, a drop of 55.8 percent.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.aaas.org/person/alessandra-zimmermann">Alessandra Zimmermann</a>, a budget analyst at the science association, said in an interview that the comprehensive analysis drew on several hundred proposed budgets from federal science agencies and programs, as well as figures supplied by the White House Office of Management and Budget. In May, the budget office made public <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/information-resources/budget/the-presidents-fy-2026-discretionary-budget-request/">the rough sketch</a> of the administration’s overall proposal for next year but included only a small number of science agencies and figures.</p>
<p>Ms. Zimmermann added that the association’s new compilations would be updated as new budget data from federal agencies and programs became available. However, she said, the group’s estimates of cuts to federal basic research are “not going to be undone by a minor number change.”</p>
<p>The science group has long recorded the ups and downs of the federal government’s annual spending on science. Taking inflation into account, Ms. Zimmermann said the administration’s proposed cut of $44 billion would, if approved, make the $154 billion figure the smallest amount that the federal government has spent on science in this century.</p>
<p>Federal funding allocated for basic research is often seen as a measure for the likelihood of breakthroughs in esoteric fields like artificial intelligence and quantum computing, areas the Trump administration <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/President-Trumps-Fiscal-Year-2026-Discretionary-Funding-Request-Overview.pdf">has prioritized</a>. According to the White House budget office, the administration has maintained funding in these areas “to ensure the United States remains on the cutting edge of these critical technologies’ development and responsible use.”</p>
<p>Each year, the president submits a budget request to Congress in advance of the annual appropriations process. Only Congress has the power to fund federal programs. That budget request thus carries no legal weight, but it does offer an opportunity for an administration to signal its priorities.</p>
<p>In May, science appeared to be high on the list for significant funding cuts, while large increases were proposed for the Pentagon and Homeland Security. Until the science association updated its reports on the proposed presidential budget for fiscal year 2026, however, the public had no clear indication of the overall size of the federal cuts.</p>
<p>The proposed drop in federal funding for science research, if approved by Congress, could let China match or take the lead in global science investments, Ms. Zimmermann said.</p>
<p>In April, the science group <a href="https://www.aaas.org/news/us-rd-and-innovation-global-context-2025-data-update">published figures</a> showing that China had greatly increased support for its scientific enterprise in the past two decades. As of 2023 — the most recent year available for comparisons — China’s investment was close to equaling that of the United States.</p>
<p>Experts say it could take years of data gathering to know if China is pulling into the lead.</p>
