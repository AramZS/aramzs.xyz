<p>Cannes Lions is introducing new global integrity standards following <a href="https://www.adweek.com/creativity/the-cannes-lions-2025-controversies-casting-a-shadow-over-big-awards/">a wave of scrutiny over manipulated case studies and unverifiable claims</a> that cast a shadow over the 2025 festival.</p>
<p>The new framework—announced on Thursday and set to take effect for all 2026 submissions—aims to “provide a renewed model of accountability, rigor, and trust for creative excellence,” according to Cannes Lions CEO Simon Cook.</p>
<p>“Creativity is only valuable if it’s credible,” Cook said in a statement. “And credibility must be earned, not assumed.”</p>
<p>The standards include a dual-layer fact-checking system using AI and human review, mandatory senior sign-offs on entries from both agency and client, clear rules around synthetic media, and a new Integrity Council to oversee escalated cases.</p>
<p>Agencies found to have submitted deliberately misleading work may face a ban of up to three years.</p>
<p>The move follows a string of high-profile scandals at this year’s festival that led to withdrawn Lions, executive departures, and client backlash.</p>
<p>It began when DM9’s Grand Prix-winning campaign for Whirlpool Consul was found to include <a href="https://www.adweek.com/agencies/cnn-brasil-filed-formal-complaint-over-dm9s-cannes-winning-campaign/">AI-manipulated footage from a CNN Brasil broadcast</a>. The agency apologized, and <a href="https://www.adweek.com/agencies/dm9s-icaro-doria-departs-following-cannes-lions-controversy/">co-president and chief creative officer Icaro Doria stepped down</a>. Cannes Lions later <a href="https://www.adweek.com/agencies/cannes-lions-revokes-dm9s-grand-prix-will-introduce-ai-safeguards/">revoked the Grand Prix and two additional awards</a>, calling the submission a “breach of factual representation.”</p>
<p>Soon after, <a href="https://www.adweek.com/agencies/lepub-investigation-cannes-lion-win-followers-store/">LePub São Paulo came under fire</a> for its Bronze Lion–winning campaign for New Balance and São Paulo FC, which reportedly featured unverifiable sales data and lacked client approval. New Balance said it was unaware of the submission and had not signed off on the case.</p>
<p>Since then, campaigns from Gut Amsterdam, Talented India, and FCB India have also drawn scrutiny for allegedly misrepresenting results or overstating agency contributions.</p>
<p>In response, Cannes Lions said it would introduce enhanced safeguards to preserve the awards’ credibility—many of which have now been formally codified in the new integrity standards.</p>
<p>The 2026 standards are built around five pillars:</p>
<ol> <li><strong>Ownership and Authorship</strong>: Submissions must be approved by both the business leader of the entrant agency and a senior marketer from the brand.</li> <li><strong>Veracity of Claims</strong>: A dual-layer fact-checking system using human reviewers and AI will interrogate campaign claims. Juries will also access independent data and measurement experts.</li> <li><strong>Consequences for Misrepresentation</strong>: Cannes can revoke awards at any point. Agencies found to have submitted false work could be banned for up to three years.</li> <li><strong>Independent Oversight</strong>: A new Integrity Council of legal and ethics experts will oversee disputed entries.</li> <li><strong>Transparency</strong>: Cannes will publish an annual Integrity Audit summarizing concerns and outlining changes made.</li> </ol>
<p>Cannes Lions also plans to publish an AI Integrity Handbook, based on frameworks from the OECD and UNESCO, to clarify expectations around synthetic media use in awards submissions.</p>
<p>Cook framed the changes as essential to keeping pace with a rapidly evolving creative industry. “These timely changes mark the beginning of a new era for us all—not just for Cannes Lions, but for the future state of global creative marketing,” he said.</p>
