  I didn’t sign up for the Trump Mobile cellphone plan. I still haven’t received
  my gold plated Trump phone. But the company just charged my credit card again.

<p>Last month I put down $100 to pre-order the Trump Organization’s forthcoming mobile phone, the T1. Or, I tried to. As I <a href="https://www.404media.co/trump-mobile-phone-preorder-fail/"><u>wrote at the time</u></a>, the website went to an error page, charged my credit card the wrong amount of $64.70, and sent a confirmation email saying I would receive another confirmation email when my order had been shipped, but I hadn’t provided a shipping address.</p>
<p>I was surprised then to see another two charges on my card from Trump Mobile on Thursday, for $100 and $64.70 respectively. I did not expect or authorize these charges and will be trying to get my money back, if they go through (they’re currently pending). I don’t know when I will get my phone. I also don’t know how to make the charges to my credit card stop because other parts of the (since updated) website also return errors and the customer service number I called on the website couldn’t help either.</p>
<p>At first, the Trump Mobile phone pre-order process was bumbling. The company is now charging my card again and I have no idea why.</p>
