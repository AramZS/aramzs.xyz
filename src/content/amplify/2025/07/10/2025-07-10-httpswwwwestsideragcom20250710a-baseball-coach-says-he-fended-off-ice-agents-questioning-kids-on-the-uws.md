<p>After coaching baseball on the west side of Manhattan for more than 20 years, Youman Wilder says he had a first-of-a-kind experience at the end of last month.</p>
<p>Wilder was leading a group of 11 middle school and high school kids through a batting cage practice near 72nd Street in Riverside Park, when he had an unexpected run-in with United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, according to the baseball coach.</p>
<p>“I go over quickly and the agents are asking the kids inappropriate things like where they are from, their country of origin, so I say, ‘whoa, whoa,’ and I tell the officers that their questions are inappropriate, and that I’m going to tell my kids not to answer them,” Wilder told the Rag.</p>
<p>On July 3, WSR sent an email to the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency to confirm if agents had been in Riverside Park on that day. On July 7, we received a call from a spokesperson from the agency who wasn’t able to confirm anything on the record at the time, but said they would send an email with an official statement by Thursday.</p>
<p>The Rag has not received that email as of midday Thursday, and we have sent multiple follow-up calls and emails. We will update this story, if we do hear back on the record from the federal agency.</p>
<p>However, on July 3, Upper West Side Assemblymember Linda Rosenthal included a section in her newsletter titled — “ICE Sighting on the Upper West Side.”</p>
<p>“I recently learned that ICE agents approached a group of kids attending baseball practice near the batting cages near West 71st Street in Riverside Park,” Rosenthal wrote, as first reported by ILovetheUpperWestSide. “The only thing that stood between those kids in Riverside Park and a Florida detention center buried deep in the Everglades was a brave coach who knew the law.”</p>
<p>There have been examples of <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/04/us/ice-impersonators-on-the-rise-arrests-made-as-authorities-issue-national-warning">people impersonating ICE officers</a> and the Rag has not been able to independently confirm as of Thursday if ICE agents were in Riverside Park at the end of last month.</p>
<p>We did get in touch with that “brave coach,” though.</p>
<p>Here is our phone interview with Wilder, <a href="https://pix11.com/news/harlem-baseball-hitting-academy-teaching-more-than-sports/">who has run the Harlem Baseball Hitting Academy</a> since 2003, about his account of what happened within the Upper West Side section of Riverside Park on June 26. We also asked Wilder if he could put us in touch with any of the parents of the children who were in Riverside Park on that day, but he told us the families said they were not comfortable speaking to a reporter about the issue, even anonymously.</p>
<p><strong>WSR:</strong> Would you start with a retelling of the events from your perspective?</p>
<p><strong>Wilder:</strong> We were about to finish up practice and my kids always tell me I’m old and can’t shoot a basketball, so I went over to the nearby court to shoot around. When I’m over there, I see people looking like federal agents in a different area, but I wasn’t paying much attention. Next thing I know, I look back at the batting cage and I see them talking to my kids.</p>
<p><strong>WSR:</strong> What happened next?</p>
<p><strong>Wilder:</strong> I go over quickly and the agents are asking the kids inappropriate things like where they are from, their country of origin, so I say, ‘whoa, whoa,’ and I tell the officers that their questions are inappropriate, and that I’m going to tell my kids not to answer them.</p>
<p><strong>WSR:</strong> How did the officers respond to that?</p>
<p><strong>Wilder:</strong> The officers started talking to me about obstruction of justice, and I repeated that the kids don’t have to speak to them, and as the person in charge of them right now, I’m going to tell them not to speak to you. Then they started to talk about cuffing me, and that if the kids were here legally, what do they have to lose by answering. I told them that they still have their <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fifth_amendment">fifth</a> and <a href="https://www.uscourts.gov/about-federal-courts/educational-resources/about-educational-outreach/activity-resources/what-does-fourth-amendment-mean#:~:text=The%20Constitution%2C%20through%20the%20Fourth,deemed%20unreasonable%20under%20the%20law.">fourth</a> amendment rights, and that they don’t have to speak to you or help with any investigation.</p>
<p><strong>WSR:</strong> And just to be clear. Why did you think they were ICE agents?</p>
<p><strong>Wilder:</strong> They said they were ICE and were wearing everything. They had ICE on their chest. They had their guns. They had their tasers.</p>
<p><strong>WSR:</strong> And can you tell me a little bit more about the kids?</p>
<p><strong>Wilder:</strong> 11 of them. All American-born in high school or junior high, but families from Africa, South America, and Mexico.</p>
<p><strong>WSR:</strong> What were you thinking in the moment, both related to agents going up to kids in Riverside Park, and also about telling you that they would put you in cuffs for obstructing?</p>
<p><strong>Wilder: </strong>It’s all about civics. If you don’t know your rights, they will trample on them. Knowing the law and understanding that they had no right to ask anything of these kids, who are American citizens, and don’t have anything to prove to them. The officers were saying we don’t know if they are American citizens, but I said, it doesn’t matter if they are American citizens or not, they still have constitutional rights, you still violate their 4th, 5th, or <a href="https://www.senate.gov/about/origins-foundations/senate-and-constitution/14th-amendment.htm">14th amendment rights.</a></p>
<p><strong>WSR:</strong> Did any other adults passing by get involved or take a photo or video of the interaction?</p>
<p><strong>Wilder:</strong> That was another thing that was crazy. There were people watching and the agents were telling them to move back, that they would be arrested for interfering, and not to take pictures. The worst thing is that the six or seven people who were watching, followed their orders!</p>
<p><strong>WSR:</strong> Did you have any moment of hesitation in terms of pushing back on the agents?</p>
<p><strong>Wilder:</strong> No, there was no moment of hesitation. Law school {Wilder says he has a law degree from Grand Canyon University] teaches you what to do in those moments. I knew that they could arrest me, but I knew that they couldn’t keep me. My whole thing is that I’m African American, and most of my kids are Latino and Black, so it was all about how do I get these kids home. I never raised my voice. I just talked about the law. And I was just focused on how can I get these kids to where they need to go, when they are in my care.</p>
<p><strong>WSR:</strong> And the agents eventually left?</p>
<p><strong>Wilder:</strong> Yes, they eventually left.</p>
<p><strong>WSR:</strong> Have you and the kids been back to that area of Riverside Park?</p>
<p><strong>Wilder:</strong> No, the kids have not been back yet. The families don’t want them returning to the Upper West Side area of the park. We’ve been meeting farther uptown now.</p>
