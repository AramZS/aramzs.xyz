<p>Ex-CEO of X, Linda Yaccarino, seems to have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/09/linda-yaccarino-steps-down-as-ceo-of-elon-musks-x/">left the company</a> on good terms. That is to say, Elon Musk has not disparaged her yet, and we know that he is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/05/why-are-elon-musk-and-donald-trump-fighting/">not known to mince words</a> about his adversaries. But now, we have the teeniest, tiniest morsel of evidence that — maybe, perhaps, possibly, if we squint our eyes really, really tight — something else could be going on.</p>
<p>Yes, reader. They took away Linda Yaccarino’s blue check!</p>
<p>Before she stepped down, Yaccarino had a blue check next to her display name, accompanied by an X logo, signifying that she is affiliated with the company that brought us <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/elon-musk-grok-chatbot-antisemitic-posts-1235381165/">Mecha Hitler</a>. Now, both badges are gone.</p>
<p>We can assume that Yaccarino was not paying for X Premium. After all, she was CEO. Do you think Ted Sarandos pays for Netflix? Or that Mark Cuban is buying Dallas Mavericks tickets on StubHub?</p>

<p>Anyone can buy a blue check, and sometimes, X will even give checkmarks to notable accounts to show that they are legit. (Here’s a pitch: blue checks, but they’re <em>only</em> given to notable accounts so that it’s harder to impersonate public figures? Nah, too boring.) But Linda’s account remains bare.</p>
<p>It makes sense that they removed her affiliation with X, since she no longer works there — but the blue check, too?</p>
<p>Corporate transitions can be awkward. I know this firsthand. Yahoo sold TechCrunch in the middle of the company-wide March Madness tournament. What would happen if I won? Would I still get my coveted prize of a Yahoo Sports sweatshirt? This was not answered in any of the transition documents that were prepared for us, which oddly focused more on things like signing up for health insurance.</p>

<p>But I got my hard-earned Yahoo Sports sweatshirt, and Linda deserves her blue check. She just left a role where she was responsible for managing situations like Elon Musk <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/29/elon-musk-says-go-fuck-yourself-to-advertisers-leaving-x/">saying “go f— yourself”</a> to advertisers on stage at a massive, livestreamed event. Just let her have this one.</p>
