<p>As Ken Paxton tries to unseat Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) in one of the most closely watched primaries in the country, state Sen. Angela Paxton said Thursday she filed for divorce “on biblical grounds.”</p>
<p>The wife of Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton (R) filed for divorce Thursday, a move likely to reverberate in his campaign to unseat Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), one of the most closely watched Senate primaries in the country.</p>
<p>Paxton’s wife, state Sen. Angela Paxton, <a href="https://x.com/AngelaPaxtonTX/status/1943366217479393512">wrote Thursday on X</a> she filed for divorce “on biblical grounds” after 38 years of marriage. She cited unspecified “recent discoveries,” though she said in her divorce filing Ken Paxton had committed adultery and they had not lived together for over a year, <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/07/10/angela-paxton-divorce-texas-attorney-general-ken/">according to the Texas Tribune</a>.</p>
