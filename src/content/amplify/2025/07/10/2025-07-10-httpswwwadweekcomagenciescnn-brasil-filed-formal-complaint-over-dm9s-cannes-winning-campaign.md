<p>CNN Brasil issued a formal complaint against ad agency DM9 and its client Whirlpool after it was revealed that segment from one of its broadcasts manipulated using AI appeared in a Cannes Lions Grand Prix-winning case study video.</p>
<p>According to a CNN International spokesperson, CNN Brasil took issue with the clip but “will take no further action” after DM9 publicly apologized for the incident on Wednesday. DM9, based São Paulo, is part of Omnicom-owned creative network DDB Worldwide.</p>
<p>The “Efficient Way to Pay,” for Whirlpool-owned Consul Appliances, won <a href="https://www.adweek.com/agencies/ddb-worldwide-crowned-cannes-lions-network-of-the-year-for-2025/">the Creative Data Grand Prix</a> at the 2025 Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity. Since the win, the work has come under mounting scrutiny from industry insiders, whistleblowers, and festival organizers for its alleged use of AI to manipulate footage from CNN Brasil.</p>
<p>On Friday, June 20, Cannes Lions launched a formal investigation into the entry. It has not revoked the Grand Prix award at the time of publication.</p>
<p>Cannes Lions did not reply to a request to comment in time for publication.</p>
<p>Upon learning of video, CNN Brasil contacted both DM9 and Whirlpool outlining that a clip used in the case study had been manipulated using AI and featured a journalist who left the network in December 2022. According to a CNN International spokesperson, the issue was raised specifically by CNN Brasil, which operates independently under license from CNN International.</p>
<p>In a LinkedIn post titled “Nota de Esclarecimento” (which translates to “Statement of Clarification” in English), DM9 acknowledged “a series of errors” in the production and submission of the case video.</p>
<p>In a statement shared with ADWEEK by DDB, co-president and chief creative officer Icaro Doria assumed full responsibility and emphasized that the client, Consul, had “no involvement whatsoever in the errors.”</p>
<p>“Success is not just the result of talent and creativity, but also of how we work and engage with others, grounded in a solid commitment to ethics and integrity,” wrote Pipo Calazans, co-president of DM9.</p>
<p>The agency said it is implementing new safeguards, including reinforcing internal processes and forming an AI Ethics Committee comprising external and independent members to oversee its responsible use.</p>
<p>The DM9 case study isn’t the first time a Cannes Lions-winning campaign has unraveled under scrutiny.</p>
<p>In 2010, Cannes <a href="https://www.adweek.com/agencyspy/ogilvy-mexico-disqualified-from-press-grand-prix-almapbbdo-wins-instead/#:~:text=Whoops%2C%20looks%20like%20Ogilvy%20Mexico,Scrabble%20campaign%20was%20previously%20entered.">disqualified a Grand Prix-winning campaign from Ogilvy Mexico for Scrabble</a> just 45 minutes before the ceremony, after it was revealed the work had been previously entered in 2008—a violation of the competition’s rules.</p>
<p>In 2016, Grey Group Singapore <a href="https://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/grey-grudgingly-returns-bronze-lion-it-won-cannes-questionable-i-sea-app-172397/">returned a Bronze Lion for its “I Sea” app</a> after critics revealed that the app—which claimed to help users spot refugees in distress via live satellite feeds—did not actually work. It was pulled from the App Store, and Grey’s charity partner, MOAS (Migrant Offshore Aid Station), publicly distanced itself from the campaign.</p>
<p>Both incidents placed pressure on Cannes Lions to strengthen its vetting process and raised questions about the incentives agencies face to overstate—or fabricate—innovation and impact in pursuit of awards. The DM9 case adds urgency to these concerns, especially as AI introduces new ways to manipulate work.</p>
<p>“Efficient Way to Pay” allowed low-income Brazilian families to purchase new, energy-efficient refrigerators using money saved on future utility bills. The campaign’s case study video showcased testimonials, energy data, and broader economic impacts—elements that helped win over jurors in the Creative Data category.</p>
<p>But shortly after the win, people began circulating the video in industry WhatsApp groups. Sources alleged it contained manipulated content, including a TED Talk by North Carolina State Senator DeAndrea Salvador and a CNN Brasil news segment. Those claims were further investigated by media outlets and Cannes Lions organizers.</p>
<p>Despite the controversy, DM9 left Cannes with 21 Lions, including five Golds and seven Silvers. The wins helped parent network <a href="https://www.adweek.com/agencies/ddb-worldwide-crowned-cannes-lions-network-of-the-year-for-2025/">DDB Worldwide reclaim the title of Network of the Year</a>, an honor it last won in 2023.</p>
