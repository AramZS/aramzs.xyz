  Other people might note his alien-ness and quickly forget it, but I couldn’t
  unsee it. And because I couldn’t unsee his, I couldn’t unsee mine.

title: My Problem With Superman
---
<div><div><p>I found myself curious about Superman’s origins as a literary creation, the forerunner material from which he sprang. I read Philip Wylie’s “Gladiator” and Lester Dent’s “Doc Savage.” I read Olaf Stapledon’s “Odd John” and Edgar Rice Burroughs’s John Carter books, of whom the early Superman was an obvious inversion. John Carter travels to Mars, where the lower gravity grants him incredible powers, including the ability to leap tall buildings in a single bound. Superman, similarly, travels to Earth, where the yellow rays of the sun give him almost every power imaginable. Like John Carter, Superman is not just a physical prodigy; he’s also a moral one. That’s what sets him apart from, and above, the people he’s going to care for — or rule.</p><p>Ultimately, I began to obsess over one specific kind of Superman.</p><p>There is a subgenre of Superman stories, pastiches of Superman that exist outside the official franchise. He has more clones, more duplicates, more sendups than anyone — what the villain Bizarro (himself an imperfect copy of Superman) called his “perfect imperfect duplicates.” These stories break Superman out of his oneiric purgatory. They make him and his terrifying powers consequential, exploring rather than strangling the troubling contradictions Superman introduces.</p><p>The master of this genre is the legendary comic writer Alan Moore. He penned what are widely considered the greatest Superman stories — “For the Man Who Has Everything” and “Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?” — stories whose refusal to gloss over Superman’s losses gave the character an almost heartbreaking poignancy. But Alan Moore also wrote the two most influential perfect imperfect duplicate Superman stories — the much lauded “Watchmen” and the lesser-known “Miracleman.”</p><p>There is no better or darker Superman story in my book than “Miracleman,” in which the British government creates superheroes and controls them via a Matrix-like hallucination (another unchanging climate), where the supervillains are a former Nazi scientist and a super-psycho so genocidal he makes Thanos look like Jimmy Olsen. When our superheroes fight, they destroy London and kill hundreds of thousands. Our hero, Miracleman, “wins” the battle but faster than you can say “Kimota!” he takes over the planet, imposing on humanity a benign utopian dictatorship where many of civilization’s ills are banished and all can gain super bodies and normal, base line humanity is slowly driven extinct.</p><p>The end.</p><p>“Miracleman” is the reason we have stories like “The Boys” that feature the star-spangled sociopathic hero Homelander; it is the book that comes close to being the final word on the myth of the Man of Tomorrow. It was in stories like these, which follow the apocalyptic logic underpinning an all-powerful hero to its exterminating conclusion, that Superman finally spoke true for me. If, as the historian Julian C. Chambliss observes, “comic books and superheroes offer a distinct means to understand U.S. culture,” then the subgenre of perfect imperfect Superman duplicates offers a means to wrestle with the nature of U.S. hegemonic power, a power that these stories suggest might be less about liberty and justice than about mass death and its almost immediate forgetting. It was in these Superman clones that I found the Superman I’d long looked for, the one I could believe.</p></div></div>
