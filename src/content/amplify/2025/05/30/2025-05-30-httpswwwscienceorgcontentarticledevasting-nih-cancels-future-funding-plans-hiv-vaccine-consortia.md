  The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) has canceled
  future funding for two major HIV vaccine research consortia, which may hinder
  progress in developing effective vaccines. Experts are concerned this decision
  will disrupt ongoing projects and reduce overall funding for HIV vaccine
  research. Researchers stress that the work from these consortia has been
  crucial for advancements in vaccine development, not just for HIV but for
  other diseases as well.

<h2>Researchers decry agency’s decision just as new leads reinvigorate search for long-sought vaccine</h2>

<p>In a move that could bring future research on HIV vaccines to a near halt, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) notified researchers today that it will not renew funding next year for two major consortia in the beleaguered field, <em>Science </em>has learned. NIAID also recently stopped funding three research groups that evaluate experimental vaccines in monkeys.</p>
<p>The notification, which was communicated verbally by NIAID program officers, “couldn't have happened at a worse time, because the recent clinical trial results [for candidate HIV vaccines] are very promising,” says Dennis Burton of Scripps Research, who heads one of the two Consortia for HIV/AIDS Vaccine Development (CHAVD).</p>
<p>Although researchers in the field acknowledge a vaccine for the AIDS-causing virus remains far off, the new leads have brought a fresh sense of optimism, and many scientists say they demand vigorous follow up. “This sets us back at a pivotal moment,” says Mitchell Warren, executive director of AVAC, a nonprofit that advocates for HIV prevention. The consortia “really have been pioneers in vaccine discovery,” says Warren, who is not involved in their work.</p>
<p>The consortia, initially formed in 2005, have more than a dozen institutional partners between them. They have moved what are widely considered the most cutting-edge, experimental HIV vaccines into clinical trials. In 2019, NIAID awarded 7-year grants worth $129 million each to two consortia leaders: Scripps Research and Duke University. Today’s notification means that they will not have a chance to renew the funding when those grants end in June 2026.</p>
<p>Burton said he was told NIAID was directed to do this, but it's unclear whether the decision to stop funding the consortia was made by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) or the National Institutes of Health (NIH), which oversees NIAID. When asked specifically about this, HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon did not answer the question but instead emphasized that the department will continue to fund “critical” HIV/AIDS work. “We must end this wasteful and inefficient model of health programming in favor of strategic, coordinated approaches,” Nixon wrote.</p>
<p>Barton Haynes, the head of the CHAVD at Duke, says he had previously been told that NIAID’s advisory council last year approved a plan to fund similar consortia, at more than $30 million annually for 5 years, and the agency would send out a request for proposals. But today NIAID told Haynes and Burton that was not going to happen. An email sent by NIH’s acting director of extramural research, which <em>Science </em>verified, said “NIH leadership” did not support this moving forward and that it quashed the plan because “NIH expects to be shifting its focus towards using currently available approaches to eliminate HIV/AIDS.”</p>
<p>The decision has left CHAVD researchers uncertain about how to proceed with just 1 year of funding left. “There's been a massive investment over the years in this, and it's really starting to pay off, and now, boom, it’s just stopped,” Burton says. “Projects will now be terminated or splintered and there won't be cohesion. We rely on multiple different teams working together to advance quickly, and that's likely to be lost now.”</p>
<p>“It’s devastating, and we’re going to have to find new partners,” Haynes says.</p>
<p>Burton also worries that NIAID’s pullback could extend to HIV vaccine research beyond the consortia. “It would seem from the [email] that they're going to reduce HIV vaccine funding greatly overall,” he says. “This will become a fragmented field, if indeed it continues at all.” Both Burton and Haynes also stress that the investments in their consortia have led to findings aiding the development of vaccines for other conditions, including COVID-19 and respiratory syncytial virus disease.</p>
<p>Researchers for 40 years have sought to develop an HIV vaccine that could provide years of protection against infection and, before there were good HIV antivirals, the ravages of AIDS. Current treatments can now powerfully control the virus and stave off disease –and can prevent uninfected people from catching the virus if used prophylactically–but they require daily pills or relatively frequent injections. And despite progress in HIV prevention, 1.3 million people became infected by the virus last year</p>
<p>An analysis done by AVAC showed that in 2022, NIH was the largest single funder of HIV vaccine research, providing 70% of $740 million spent globally on the effort that year. The agency’s prominent role means the end of CHAVD will be a big blow to the field, says immunologist John Moore, a veteran HIV vaccine researcher who is not part of the consortia. “It's very difficult to compensate for the volume of NIH dollars,” says Moore, who believes “The agenda at HHS is to eliminate vaccine science, so this is one opportunity for them to do so.”</p>
<p>Each of the CHAVD consortia have set their sights on designing vaccines that guide the immune system to develop what are called “broadly neutralizing antibodies” that work against a wide range of HIV variants. “It's taken a long time, and I think that's frustrated the field and certainly has frustrated us, but the good news is now that [both consortia] are making progress,” Haynes says. “It’s still very difficult, and we’re committed to finishing the job,” perhaps by finding other funders to fill the gap left by the lack of NIAID support.</p>
<p>NIAID separately has notified three of its Simian Vaccine Evaluation Units that it will no longer issue contracts for them to use monkeys to test vaccines that come out of these consortia and other NIH-funded grants. “This will definitely slow things down,” says Mark Lewis, an immunologist and virologist who is CEO of Bioqual Inc., one of these three groups. “They're throwing nuclear bombs in the scientific community. It's going to be totally shocking, and it will take decades to rebuild.”</p>
