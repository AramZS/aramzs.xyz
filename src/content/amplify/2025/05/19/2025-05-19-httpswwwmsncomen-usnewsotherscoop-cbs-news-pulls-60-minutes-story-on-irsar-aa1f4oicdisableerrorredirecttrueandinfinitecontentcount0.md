(Photo via Wikimedia Commons)</figcaption></figure><p>Paramount Global's CBS News pulled a "60 Minutes" segment on job losses at the Internal Revenue Service hours before it was scheduled to air on Sunday, <em>The Desk</em> has learned.</p><p>The segment was listed in program guides for 60 Minutes, and was set to focus on layoffs that have impacted more than 7,000 probationary IRS workers since the start of the year — cuts that were effectuated through executive action by President Donald Trump and facilitated by senior advisor Elon Musk and members of his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) team.</p><p>The segment was one of several listed in program guides for 60 Minutes on Sunday, which also included stories on Chinese covert agents and a tech mogul who founded a startup company focused on new forms of warfare. CBS ultimately replaced the IRS story with a feature profile on Cajun music.</p><p>In a note, a Paramount spokesperson said the segment on the IRS was pulled after producers working on the story learned that the IRS had reversed their firings of probationary workers. The IRS plans to call many of them back to the office by the end of the week.</p><p>"Our team will continue to report on these new details and will broadcast the story in the future," a spokesperson for Paramount said in a statement.</p><p>The story comes amid heightened tension between newsroom leaders and Paramount executives. Paramount, the owner of CBS, is in the process of merging with Skydance Media; an element of the transaction involves the transfer of broadcast licenses for nearly two dozen CBS-owned local TV stations, which must be approved by the Federal Communications Commisson (FCC).</p><p>That approval has been held up by the FCC under its new Chairman, Brendan Carr, after President Donald Trump sued Paramount and CBS News over an interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris that aired in the weeks leading up to the presidential election last year. Trump has accused CBS News of engaging in news distortion and election interference because 60 Minutes aired a shorter version of an answer given by Harris in response to a question about the ongoing conflict in Israel. A longer version of the answer aired hours early on the political affairs program "Face the Nation," which also airs on CBS.</p><p>The lawsuit has been deemed frivolous by media and legal analysts, and Paramount initially vowed to fight it. But, in recent weeks, Paramount and its controlling shareholder, Shari Redstone, have indicated a willingness to settle with Trump if it greases the wheels for its transaction with Skydance to be approved.</p><p>According to reports, Redstone has encouraged Paramount and CBS News to reduce their critical journalism of the Trump administration while the transaction remains pending. Redstone stands to financially benefit from the merger if it is approved.</p><p>Last month, long-time 60 Minutes executive producer Bill Owens <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/22/business/media/cbs-60-minutes-trump-bill-owens.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">resigned from the network</a>, saying the news magazine program had lost its editorial independence. The following weekend, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley noted the resignation, saying no one at 60 Minutes was happy about the situation.</p><p>"It was hard on him, and it was hard on us," Pelley said. "But he did it for us, and you."</p><p>On Monday, CBS News and Stations President Wendy McMahon announced her resignation, saying her departure was the byproduct of "challenging" times.</p><p>"It’s become clear that the company and I do not agree on the path forward. It’s time for me to move on and for this organization to move forward with new leadership," McMahon, who oversaw the editorial and business initiatives of CBS-owned local TV stations, wrote in an all-staff memo to employees.</p><p>Later in the day, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/19/paramount-cbs-news-ceo-wendy-mcmahon.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">CNBC reported</a> that McMahon's departure was encouraged by Paramount co-CEO George Cheeks, who met with McMahon over the weekend and asked for her to leave the company. CNBC said Redstone had expressed disapproval of McMahon's leadership and business approach to CBS News.</p>
