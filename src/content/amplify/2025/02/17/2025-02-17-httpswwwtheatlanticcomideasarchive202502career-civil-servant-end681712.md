  Donald Trump and Elon Musk are undermining government expertise through a
  campaign called DOGE, which falsely claims to promote efficiency. This effort
  targets civil servants and discredits experts, while prioritizing personal
  power over informed decision-making. Ultimately, their actions threaten the
  functioning of modern society, which relies on knowledgeable professionals.

title: The Death of Government Expertise

<html><body><div>Why Trump and Musk are on a firing spree</div><figure><img alt="Photo of Elon Musk shrugging his shoulders with an orange tint" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/8RMRSiDi28238wqD9BS4uPoXn08=/0x0:2000x1125/960x540/media/img/mt/2025/02/DOGE2/original.jpg"/><figcaption> (Illustration by The Atlantic. Source: Jim Watson / AFP / Getty.)</figcaption></figure><p>One of the greatest tricks that Donald Trump and Elon Musk ever pulled is to convince millions of people that DOGE, the self-styled Department of Government Efficiency, is about government efficiency.</p><p>DOGE isn’t really a department; it’s not an agency; it has no statutory authority; and it has little to do with saving money, streamlining the bureaucracy, or eliminating waste. It is a name that Trump is allowing a favored donor and ally to use in a reckless campaign against various targets in the federal government. The whole enterprise is an attack against civil servants and the very notion of apolitical expertise.</p><p>Trump allies make noises about expert failures—and yes, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/03/experts-failure-covid-19-pandemic/677816/">experts sometimes do fail</a>. In particular, MAGA world continues to demonize what its constituents believe was the medical establishment’s attempt to curtail civil rights during the coronavirus pandemic. (Those are arguable charges; Trump himself presided over a wave of <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/2020/03/29/president-trump-extends-coronavirus-shutdown-until-april-30/">shutdowns</a> in 2020.) None of these complaints explains why DOGE teams have been unleashed in places such as the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Federal Aviation Administration, and the National Reconnaissance Office, which is responsible for American spy satellites. Worse, Musk’s team accidentally <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/elon-musks-doge-website-worries-intelligence-officials-by-posting-classified-information/">posted</a> sensitive information from NRO in what one intelligence official called a “significant breach” of security.</p><p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1891/02/an-object-lesson-in-civil-service-reform/519717/">Theodore Roosevelt: An object lesson in civil-service reform</a></p><p>DOGE also blundered into dismissing hundreds of people from the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/Politics/live-updates/trump-2nd-term-tariffs-trade-war-118643360/hundreds-laid-off-at-us-nuclear-weapons-agency-sources-118828591">National Nuclear Safety Administration</a>, the agency within the Energy Department that is responsible for the stewardship of the nation’s nuclear-weapons stockpile. It’s one thing to be angry about having to wear a mask at Costco; it’s another to engage in the apparent indiscriminate firing of more than 300 people who keep watch over nuclear materials. (The agency <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/14/climate/nuclear-nnsa-firings-trump/index.html">backtracked</a> on Friday and rescinded some of those terminations.)</p><p>Populists are generally wary of experts, especially those who work for the government, but Musk is no man of the people: He is the richest human being in the world, and he runs major companies that rely both on government-provided expertise and significant government <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-hy-musk-subsidies-20150531-story.html">subsidies</a>. As my colleague Anne Applebaum <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/02/doge-civil-servant-purge/681671/">wrote</a>, “Musk has made no attempt to professionally audit or even understand many of the programs being cut”—a willful indifference that gives away the game.</p><p>Musk’s assault on expertise is coming from the same wellspring that has been driving much of the public’s irrational hostility toward experts for years. I have been <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2024/03/when-experts-fail/677867/">studying</a> “the death of expertise” for more than a decade, and I have <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://bookshop.org/a/12476/9780197763834">written extensively</a> about the phenomenon in which uninformed laypeople come to believe that they are smarter and more capable in almost any subject than experts. The death of expertise is really about the rise of two social ills: narcissism and resentment.</p><p>Self-absorption is common these days, but Musk embodies a particular brand of narcissism found among certain kinds of techno-plutocrats who assume that their wealth is evidence of competence in almost any field. After all, if you’ve made a zillion dollars inventing an app, how hard can anything else be? And although it is a truism at this point to observe that Trump is narcissistic, one thing that binds Trump and Musk and many others is their sense that their talent and inherent greatness have been dismissed by experts. Much like ordinary citizens who have “done their own research” and yet are furious that doctors won’t listen to them, Trump and Musk seem constantly angry that their wealth and power can gain them anything except respect.</p><p>You can see this resentment almost every time President Trump (and Co-President Musk) speak. No one is allowed to know more about anything than Trump. When pressed, Trump will defensively <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://x.com/RadioFreeTom/status/1889855210128023673">say things</a> such as “I’ve read a lot on it,” an implausible claim from a man who is <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://theweek.com/articles/915606/trumps-lethal-aversion-reading">famously reluctant</a> to read. Musk, for his part, commands a personal fortune so large that it dwarfs the GDP of many small countries, and he brags about having a top U.S. security clearance—but he <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/26/technology/elon-musk-video-games-diablo-path-of-exile.html">bristles</a> at any doubts about whether he is, in fact, the most accomplished player of the video game <em>Diablo IV</em>.</p><p>For Trump and his allies, this kind of resentment is tightly threaded into  practical and self-interested concerns: Apolitical experts in a democracy are a strong <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/02/civil-service-trump/681572/">line of defense</a> against politically motivated chicanery. Meanwhile, Musk and others believe that money should translate directly into power, and that their wealth should confer intellectual legitimacy. Such people chafe at the reality that getting their way still sometimes requires arguing with experts, and that opposing those experts requires knowledge. Their solution is not to listen or learn but to try to replace those troublesome pencil necks with pliable servants.</p><p>I’ve experienced this phenomenon firsthand: More than a year ago, Musk’s occasional sidekick David Sacks was so offended by an online disagreement with me about the Russia-Ukraine war that he <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://x.com/DavidSacks/status/1740639660374724786">publicly</a> made a large donation to the GoFundMe page of a part-time professor in Canada whose views more closely aligned with his own. He did this in my name, as if that would help him gain the upper hand in an argument that required facts and expertise.</p><p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/11/making-government-efficient-again/680672/">Robert P. Beschel Jr.: Making government efficient again</a></p><p>Another dynamic at play is that Trump, Musk, and many others treat “experts” and “elites” as functionally indistinguishable. This is a dishonest claim, but it is useful in mobilizing public sentiment against experts in the name of a mindless egalitarianism. It is also part of the overall ruse: The DOGE assault has nothing to do with merit or equality. Indeed, Musk’s attack on federal agencies, with one group of privileged and educated people trying to displace another, is the most intra-elite squabble Washington has seen in years.</p><p>A similar resentment may also drive the young volunteers who are waving Musk’s name in front of career government servants. Washington has always been full of disappointed strivers who feel they’ve been kept out of the game by snotty social and intellectual gatekeepers—and, as a former young striver in the capital, I can affirm that there’s some truth in that. Now they’re in charge and more than ready to become obnoxious new elitists themselves. (“Do I need to call Elon?” one young DOGE-nik reportedly <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/musk-trump-doge-threats-nerd-army-1235267839/">snapped</a> when a federal official had the temerity to deny him access to sensitive information.)</p><p>In the early 20th century, the Spanish writer José Ortega y Gasset <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://bookshop.org/a/12476/9780393310955">warned</a> that such resentment would eventually become the enemy of talent and ability. “The mass crushes beneath it everything that is different,” he wrote in 1930, “everything that is excellent, individual, qualified and select. Anybody who is not like everybody, who does not think like everybody, runs the risk of being eliminated.” Trump and Musk not only feel this same impulse; they have harnessed it for their personal use.</p><p>Eventually, such attacks run out of steam when the costs begin to accumulate. No matter how many times Stalin told his scientists to plant wheat <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://ethos.lps.library.cmu.edu/article/id/560/">in the snow</a> so that it could evolve to grow in the winter, the wheat (which had no political allegiances) died. Today, vaccine refusal might seem like a brave stand against white-jacketed overlords—until your children are stricken with <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/14/health/measles-texas-outbreak/index.html">measles</a> or whooping cough.</p><p>Modern societies, as Americans are soon to learn, cannot function without experts in every field, especially the many thousands who work in public service. The first step in containing the damage is to see Trump’s and Musk’s goals for DOGE clearly: It is a project rooted in resentful arrogance, and its true objective is not better government, but destruction.</p></body></html>
