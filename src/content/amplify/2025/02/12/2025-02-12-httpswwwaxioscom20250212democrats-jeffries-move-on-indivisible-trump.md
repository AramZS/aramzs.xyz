  House Democrats are frustrated with liberal groups like MoveOn and Indivisible
  for encouraging constituents to call their offices. They feel these groups are
  pushing for a more aggressive stance against Republicans, even though
  Democrats are in the minority. In response, Indivisible argues that people are
  anxious and want more action from their lawmakers.

<p>A closed-door meeting for House Democrats this week included a gripe-fest directed at liberal grassroots organizations, sources tell Axios.</p>
<p><strong>Why it matters: </strong>Members of the Steering and Policy Committee — with House Minority Leader <a data-vars-click-url="https://www.axios.com/2025/02/07/democrats-mike-johnson-goverment-shutdown-jeffries" data-vars-content-id="b83a4330-a7a7-4e64-ad8f-add42ad26acb" data-vars-event-category="story" data-vars-headline='Scoop: Dems "pissed" at liberal groups MoveOn, Indivisible' data-vars-item="in_content_link" data-vars-link-text="Hakeem Jeffries" data-vars-sub-category="story" href="https://www.axios.com/2025/02/07/democrats-mike-johnson-goverment-shutdown-jeffries">Hakeem Jeffries</a> (D-N.Y.) in the room — on Monday complained activist groups like MoveOn and Indivisible have facilitated <a data-vars-click-url="https://www.axios.com/2025/02/06/democrats-congress-trump-musk-doge-calls" data-vars-content-id="b83a4330-a7a7-4e64-ad8f-add42ad26acb" data-vars-event-category="story" data-vars-headline='Scoop: Dems "pissed" at liberal groups MoveOn, Indivisible' data-vars-item="in_content_link" data-vars-link-text="thousands of phone calls to members' offices." data-vars-sub-category="story" href="https://www.axios.com/2025/02/06/democrats-congress-trump-musk-doge-calls">thousands of phone calls to members' offices.</a></p>
<ul><li>"People are pissed," a senior House Democrat who was at the meeting said of lawmakers' reaction to the calls.</li><li>The Democrat said Jeffries himself is "very frustrated" at the groups, who are trying to stir up a more confrontational opposition to Trump.</li><li>Jeffries' office did not immediately reply to a request for comment.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Zoom in</strong>: "There were a lot of people who were like, 'We've got to stop the groups from doing this.' ... People are concerned that they're saying we're not doing enough, but we're not in the majority," said one member.</p>
<ul><li><strong>Some Democrats see the callers </strong>as barking up the wrong tree given their limited power as the minority party in Congress: "It's been a constant theme of us saying, 'Please call the Republicans,'" said Rep. Don Beyer (D-Va.).</li><li><strong>"I reject and resent</strong> the implication that congressional Democrats are simply standing by passively," said Rep. Ritchie Torres (D-N.Y.).</li></ul>
<p><strong>The other side:</strong> "People are angry, scared, and they want to see more from their lawmakers right now than floor speeches about Elon Musk," Indivisible co-founder Leah Greenberg told Axios.</p>
<ul><li><strong>"Indivisible is urging people</strong> who are scared to call their member of Congress, whether they have a Democrat or Republican, and make specific procedural asks," Greenberg said.</li><li><strong>"Our supporters</strong> are asking Democrats to demand specific red lines are met before they offer their vote to House Republicans on the budget, when Republicans inevitably fail to pass a bill on their own."</li><li><strong>MoveOn</strong> officials declined to comment.</li></ul>
