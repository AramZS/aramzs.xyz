  The article humorously discusses how ICE agents can dress in a way that makes
  them look less official and more like regular people. It suggests that by not
  wearing a uniform, agents can avoid raising suspicion when they carry out
  their duties. The piece also critiques the lack of accountability and
  professionalism in the way ICE agents may present themselves.

Can I really do this job while wearing either an Army uniform that I have assembled myself in a confusing, over-the-top way or the same T-shirt I just wore to my failed custody hearing?</i></p><p>Sure! Here’s what to wear to let everyone who interacts with you know that you are an agent of ICE!</p><p>Do we have a uniform? No.</p><p>Uniforms show that you are part of something and that there is someone to call if anyone interacting with you has a complaint. A uniform indicates that you are not a rogue criminal seizing someone’s mom and hurling her into an unmarked van without reading her her rights: You’re an <i>officer of the law</i> doing that.</p><p>Who are they going to call about some guy in an ill-fitting T-shirt and long shorts? Why, behind that face covering, he could be the billionaire Mark Zuckerberg! Better treat him as though he is worth billions and accountable to no one, just in case!</p><p>If you’re wearing a uniform, people will be disappointed when you fail to show them an arrest warrant before<b> </b>entering their place of work. If you’re not wearing a uniform of any kind, they won’t know whether to be disappointed until it’s too late!</p><p>If you decide to wear some sort of uniform anyway (Army Surplus? January 6 Surplus? Your choice!), you can still send the message that you intend to be accountable to no one by wearing a face covering.</p><p>A face mask can say so many things: “I’m trying to do my part to protect those around me,” or  the exact opposite. A balaclava can say, “I’m skiing!” or, “I’m about to commit a jewelry heist,” depending on how you accessorize it.</p><p>The point is, we want you to feel free to express yourself! ICE believes in freedom of expression, except for graduate students who want to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/03/mahmoud-khalil-arrest-palestinian/682044/">lead protests</a> or <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/05/foreign-students-trump/682955/">write op-eds</a>. Your clothing should tell a story about you! Just not who you are or that you are acting in any kind of official capacity. Wear a pink button-down, a shirt, a jacket, and some sort of backwards hat. Wear something that looks like what Ben Affleck would wear if he were really going through it and was visiting the Dunkin’ drive-through on foot. Wear something that, if you showed up at a costume party in this outfit, would make people say, “A soldier, but wrong somehow, like he’s in a video game,” or, “Did I see you at <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/09/a-history-of-violence/538659/">Charlottesville</a>?”</p><p>If the person you are shoving into a van has any inkling that you are an officer of the law, you are doing it wrong. You should look like someone who is going to Home Depot because you forgot something (what you forgot was an arrest warrant for your next stop).</p><p>As Coco Chanel said, whenever you assemble an outfit, before you leave the house, look in the mirror, and take one thing off! Specifically, your badge identifying you as an officer of the law. <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20240220-the-truth-about-coco-chanel-and-the-nazis">Coco</a> collaborated with the Nazis.</p><p>Remember, the right ensemble and accessories can say: <i>I’m accountable to the people of the United States, and we are still operating under rule of law</i>. So before you get dressed each morning, think about the message you want your outfit to send. It shouldn’t be that.</p></body></html>
