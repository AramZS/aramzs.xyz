<p>A German court ruled on Tuesday that OpenAI violated copyright on nine popular songs in a lawsuit that marked another attempt to prevent the free use of artists' content online.</p>
<p>The Munich Regional Court found that the US company had used copyright-protected song lyrics to train its ChatGPT language generator.</p>
<p>Music rights group GEMA sued the artificial intelligence company specifically over the use of nine well-known songs, including "Atemlos," best known from Helene Fischer's hugely successful interpretation "Atemlos durch die Nacht," and Herbert Grönemeyer's "Männer."</p>
<p>The court concluded that the song lyrics, used to train ChatGPT, had been stored in OpenAI's systems. The AI firm had argued in vain that the system only learns from, but does not store, such material.</p>
<p>However, the court said it was implausible that ChatGPT would reproduce the song lyrics in such a recognizable form if this were the case.</p>
<p>It also concluded that OpenAI is responsible for ChatGPT's output, not the users, as the company argued.</p>
<p>Presiding Judge Elke Schwager summarized the case with a simple example, saying that if you want to build something and need components, "then you purchase them and do not use the property of others."</p>
<p>The court ordered OpenAI to refrain from storing the lyrics and outputting them in its models, to pay damages, and to disclose information about the use of the songs and the income generated from them.</p>
<p>GEMA's chief legal officer, Kai Welp, expressed satisfaction with the result. "What the defendant is doing is no different from what other services on the internet do, and they have to obtain a licence from rights holders before they use their work," he said.</p>
<p>He said the ruling will send a signal to the whole of Europe.</p>
<p>Silke von Lewinski from the Max Planck Institute for Innovation and Competition in Munich also sees implications of the ruling far beyond song lyrics for the use of all works of art by generative AI. She believes that a definitive GEMA victory in the case would shift the balance of power between the creative industries and technology companies.</p>
<p>"Before a text can be used for generative AI, the rights holders would have to give their consent and would have the opportunity to be remunerated," she said.</p>
<p>However, the ruling is not yet final and is likely to be appealed, with OpenAI already considering further steps.</p>
<p>It said it disagreed with the ruling and emphasized that the court's decision only affects a limited set of song lyrics and has no impact on users.</p>
