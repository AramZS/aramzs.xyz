<p>For five months, particularly in the weeks leading up to the November 4 New York City mayoral election, sitting lawmakers in the U.S. Congress have been making overtly racist and hateful comments targeting now Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani. And mainstream U.S. media outlets, with rare exception, have completely ignored it.</p>
<p>Limiting the scope to just the past month, which includes the final weeks of the campaign, election night, and its subsequent converge, Republicans in Congress have unleashed the following attacks on Mamdani:</p>
<ul><li><p>Rep. Randy Fine (R-Fla.): ​“We need to take a hard look at how [people like Mamdani] became citizens, and if there is any fraud or any violation of the rules we need to denaturalize and deport… I know that there’s a lot of us that are very, very concerned about the enemy within — people who have come to this country to become citizens, to destroy it.” (<a href="https://nypost.com/2025/10/25/us-news/house-republicans-push-to-denaturalize-mamdani-over-citizenship-form/">10/25/25</a>)</p></li><li><p>Rep. Fine: ​“The barbarians are no longer at the gate, they’re inside. … And Mamdani, having just moved here eight years ago, is a great example of that.” [note: Mamdani moved to the United States in 1998]. (<a href="https://www.politifact.com/article/2025/nov/07/Zohran-Mamdani-citizenship-denaturalize-Fine-Ogles/">10/27/25)</a></p></li><li><p>Rep. Brandon Gill (R-Tex.), in reference to Mamdani releasing a campaign ad in Arabic: ​“Just a couple decades after 9/11, the leading candidate for NYC mayor is campaigning in Arabic. The humiliation is the point.” (<a href="https://x.com/RepBrandonGill/status/1984818428239020256">11/1/25</a>)</p></li><li><p>Rep. Fine: ​“Zohran Mamdani must be deported immediately. The only thing I want to see him running for is his gate at JFK for his deportation flight back to Uganda.” (<a href="https://x.com/repfine/status/1985462516705567156?s=46">11/3/24</a>)</p></li><li><p>Rep. Fine: ​“Legal immigrants who hate America elected a Communist Muslim Jihadist. New York City has fallen. America is next if we don’t stop it.” (<a href="https://x.com/RepFine/status/1985899881639088504">11/4/25</a>)</p></li><li><p>Rep. Andy Ogles (R-Tenn.) on election day, posted alongside a video of the 9/11 attacks: ​“WAKE UP NEW YORK! (<a href="https://x.com/RepOgles/status/1985533972604956697">11/3/25</a>)</p></li><li><p>Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) sent an email on <a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2025/nov/07/nancy-mace/mamdani-mayor-new-york-shariah-law/">11/6/25</a> with the subject head ​“Stop Muslim radicals.” After referring to Mamani’s win, it said, ​“Republicans must treat the rise of Islamic radicalism as another 9/11,” The email said, ​“New Yorkers — the same people directly impacted by 9/11 — voted to elect a man who’s bringing SHARIA LAW to America.”</p></li><li><p>Rep. Fine: ​“New York City has fallen to Muslim terror. America is next if we don’t wake up.” (<a href="https://x.com/RepFine/status/1987955418321063962?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1987955418321063962%7Ctwgr%5E8cb24191767450c51370aef816707646568092a2%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fmeidasnews.com%2Fnews%2Fmaga-rep-randy-fine-says-new-york-city-has-fallen-to-muslim-terror">11/10/25</a>)</p></li></ul>
<p>And this is just the past month in the run up to the election, election day and its aftermath (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/26/zohran-mamdani-republicans-push-investigate-citizenship">see here for a list</a> of other extremely racist comments over the past five months).</p>
<p>So how many times have CNN, NBC News, CBS News, ABC News, <em>The New York Times</em>, <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> or <em>The Washington Post</em> run articles or aired segments in this past month focusing on these racist attacks from Congressional Republicans? Zero. The answer is zero.</p>
<p>Some of the above outlets did cover an incident where Mamdani’s main challenger, Andrew Cuomo, laughed at a radio host who suggested Mamdani would celebrate another 9/11-style attack (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6nNd3pxLx0">ABC News</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/23/nyregion/cuomo-mamdani-sept-11.html"><em>New York Times</em></a>). But none of these write-ups mentioned, nor did any of these outlets write separate articles detailing, the racist attacks from Republicans in Congress. <em>The Washington Post</em>, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/11/05/mamdani-mayor-muslim-newyork/">in a broader article</a> about Mamdani being the first Muslim mayor of New York City, did include a passing mention of Rep. Brandon Gill’s ​“humiliation” tweet, but did not make Congressional Republican attacks on Mamdani the focus of the article. A <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/11/05/mamdani-win-internet-reaction/">November 5</a> article in <em>The Washington Post</em> by internet culture reporter Tatum Hunter made reference ​​to a post on X by Rep. Randy Fine but edited out the overt racism. Hunter began her reporting:</p>
<blockquote>As the country absorbed Zohran Mamdani’s mayoral win Tuesday night, some high-profile social media users rushed to mourn what they characterized as the destruction of America. ​“New York City has fallen,” Rep. Randy Fine (R-Florida) said in a post on X. ​“America is next if we don’t stop it.”</blockquote>
<p>Left out was the first part of Rep. Fine’s tweet where he wrote, ​“Legal immigrants who hate America elected a Communist Muslim Jihadist,” which seems like important context when discussing the nature of said ​“internet culture.” The post, of course, wasn’t framed as part of a pattern of racism and incitement, but was instead positioned as just another ​“online reaction” in a vapid trend piece on how Mamdani’s win became a ​“lightning rod for internet discourse.”</p>
<p>This is consistent with mainstream media ignoring Congressional Republicans’ overtly racist attacks on their colleagues Reps. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) and Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) last year. As I <a href="https://therealnews.com/us-media-ignores-yet-another-unhinged-racist-attack-from-gop-because-the-target-is-muslim">detailed last July</a>, in response to a post on X from Omar that echoed the International Criminal Court’s designation of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1157286">as a war criminal</a>, Fine <a href="https://x.com/RepFine/status/1942743268338389102">posted on X</a>, ​“I’m sure it is difficult to see us welcome the killer of so many of your fellow Muslim terrorists. The only shame is that you serve in Congress.” The previous month, Fine’s Republican colleague Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) told the PBD Podcast that she was ​“fine with putting [Omar] on a one way flight back to Somalia,” in response to Omar’s criticisms of Trump’s immigration crackdowns. She later doubled down on X, saying, ​“Omar clearly has more loyalty to the corrupt hellhole she came from than to the country she was elected to serve.”</p>
<p>These racist attacks were similarly not covered at the time by <em>The New York Times</em>, <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>, <em>The Washington Post</em>, NBC, ABC, or CBS network news, or on-air coverage at CNN.</p>
<p><em>The New York Times</em> did dedicate one article to anti-Muslim attacks on Mamdani which focused on Congressional Republcians during the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/26/nyregion/mamdani-muslim-attacks.html">primary</a> in June. And <em>The Washington Post </em>published similar coverage highlighting islamophobic attacks from Republicans against Mamdani <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/12/nyregion/zohran-mamdani-muslim-mayor.html?searchResultPosition=1">that same mont</a>h. Yet neither outlet has done so since.</p>
<p>This racist targeting of Mamdani, like the targeting of Tlaib and Omar, isn’t coming from random, deranged nobodies. It is a non-stop and coordinated pattern of incitement from powerful people in Congress. It is paired with very serious attempts to deport the subjects of their vitriol (specifically <a href="https://ogles.house.gov/media/press-releases/ogles-leads-charge-denaturalize-and-deport-zohran-mamdani">Mamdani</a> and <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/09/17/mace-omar-deportation-threats-charlie-kirk-censure">Omar</a>, both of whom are naturalized citizens). And it exists within a context of actual attacks on Democratic lawmakers, most recently from accused murderer Vance Boelter, who assassinated Democrats in a shooting spree in Minnesota this past June. A hit list found on Boelter included Ilhan Omar.</p>
<p>To make it even worse, the member of Congress leading the racist attacks on Mamdani, Rep. Randy Fine, was interviewed on CNN four times (<a href="https://www.mediaite.com/media/tv/house-republican-admits-on-cnn-hes-so-intense-it-scares-people-as-he-argues-against-islam-spreading-in-us/">10/20/25,</a> <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/06/politics/video/randy-fine-tucker-carlson-cornish-digvid">11/06/25</a>, <a href="https://transcripts.cnn.com/show/cnc/date/2025-11-10/segment/10">11/10/25,</a> <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/10/politics/video/government-reopening-healthcare-aca-tucker-carlson-republican-congressman-randy-fine-tsi">11/10/25</a>) during the month-long survey period, routinely presented as a good-faith expert on ​“antisemitism” and not asked a single question about his racist attacks on Mamdani. He was opaquely <a href="https://www.mediaite.com/media/tv/house-republican-admits-on-cnn-hes-so-intense-it-scares-people-as-he-argues-against-islam-spreading-in-us/">asked about attacks on Muslims in general</a> by CNN’s Brianna Keilar (<a href="https://www.mediaite.com/media/tv/house-republican-admits-on-cnn-hes-so-intense-it-scares-people-as-he-argues-against-islam-spreading-in-us/">10/20/25</a>), but was permitted to continue his hateful ranting without any meaningful pushback.</p>
<p>Clear-as-day, openly racist hatred of Muslims is ignored, factored in, or briefly mentioned in dopey “internet culture” trend pieces about how Mamdani’s win was a “lightning rod for internet discourse.”</p>
<p>Contrast the relative media silence over the racist attacks on Mamdani with the over-the-top media outrage over Rashida Tlaib’s comments in November 2023 that she believed Palestine should be free ​“from the River to the Sea.” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/09/us/politics/river-to-the-sea-israel-gaza-palestinians.html"><em>The New York Times</em></a>, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/11/01/house-censure-rashida-tlaib-fails/"><em>The Washington Post</em></a>, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/11/05/michigan-democrats-bash-tlaib-palestine-comments-00125429"><em>Politico</em></a>, <a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/11/06/rashida-tlaib-river-sea-democrats">Axios</a>, <a href="https://x.com/DanaBashCNN/status/1721960596470415542">CNN</a>, <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/yasmin-vossoughian/watch/rep-rashida-tlaib-faces-criticism-from-lawmakers-over-pro-palestinian-remarks-197164613908">MSNBC</a>, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/rep-rashida-tlaib-faces-criticism-democrats-palestinian-remarks-rcna123735">NBC News</a>, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rashida-tlaib-censure-vote-rich-mccormick-marjorie-taylor-greene/">CBS News</a>, and <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/538/squads-views-israel-bolster-primary-opposition-2024/story?id=104911329">ABC News</a> all ran breathless coverage of a phrase that is only offensive if one deliberately misunderstands its meaning. Meanwhile, clear-as-day, openly racist hatred of Muslims is ignored, factored in, or briefly mentioned in dopey ​“internet culture” trend pieces about how Mamdani’s win was a ​“lightning rod for internet discourse.” It’s treated as barely worth mentioning, much less a moral emergency.</p>
<p>Why? Because it suits the geopolitical interests of the United States and its allies. Racial hatred towards Muslims is not only acceptable, but worth only scattering media mention and the occasional, vague handwringing. Those engaged in this hateful incitement are brought on cable news and simply never asked about it. It’s treated as not urgent, not serious, and not something worthy of sustained coverage. Instead it’s treated as routine, not a big deal, and just something the targets of this incitement are expected to accept and take on the chin while Republicans in Congress invite violence and racial hatred against them.</p>
