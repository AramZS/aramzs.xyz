<p>WASHINGTON, D.C. (WJLA) — Flight operations resumed at <a href="https://wjla.com/topic/Reagan%20National%20Airport">Reagan National Airport</a> after a "security" threat forced a ground stop on Tuesday, according to airport officials and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).</p>
<p>Officials said the threat was made against an incoming United Airlines flight 512, which had 89 passengers and six crew members on board.</p>
<p>The airline confirmed the flight was traveling from Houston and landed at DCA around 11:30 a.m. The flight stopped on a runway away from the terminal.</p>
<p>This is the statement the FAA put out after the ground stop:</p>
<blockquote><em><strong>"The FAA is aware of a reported security issue on an aircraft at Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA). Passengers have been removed, and the aircraft is away from the terminal while authorities investigate."</strong></em></blockquote>

<p>Video from inside the airport shows police and first responders on the tarmac.</p>
<p>Officials said the airport runaway was closed as passengers safely offloaded and were bused to the terminal. Several flights had to be diverted to nearby airports during the closure.</p>
<p>The runways reopened at 12:50 p.m.</p>
<p>An air traffic control recording, the controller can be heard instructing the United pilot that they are moving the plane away from the airport due to an “unconfirmed bomb report” for the flight.</p>
<p>The FBI confirmed in a statement that agents were alerted to a bomb threat.</p>
<blockquote>"The FBI Washington Field Office's National Capital Response Squad responded to reports of a bomb threat at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport today. No hazards were found. The FBI continues to work with our law enforcement partners on this investigation."</blockquote>
<p>Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy also commented on the situation, <a href="https://x.com/SecDuffy/status/1985775219299270977">writing in an X post</a>:</p>
<p>"Earlier today a United flight from Houston to Washington D.C. received a bomb threat. The flight landed safely at DCA, passengers were evacuated, and law enforcement conducted a full search of the aircraft. The @FAANews has received the all clear and operations have resumed. I want to thank our brave men and women in law enforcement for their quick response."</p>
<p>Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority police are investigating.</p>
