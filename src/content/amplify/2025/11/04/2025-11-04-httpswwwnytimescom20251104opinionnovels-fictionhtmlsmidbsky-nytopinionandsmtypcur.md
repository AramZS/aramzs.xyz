<p><strong>To the Editor:</strong></p>
<p>Re “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/20/opinion/case-for-literary-fiction.html">The Dogged, Irrational Persistence of Literary Fiction</a>,” by Gerald Howard (Opinion guest essay, nytimes.com, Oct. 20):</p>
<p>Defending the continuing vitality of the literary novel, Mr. Howard points to how works of Herman Melville, William Faulkner, Jack Kerouac and others languished in obscurity before being embraced by critics and the general reading public. However, there were many literary novels — by Leo Tolstoy, Émile Zola, Ernest Hemingway and Thomas Mann, to name a few — that were in fact widely read and successful at the time of their publication.</p>
<p>Some novelists who are currently obscure might one day be recognized and canonized, but the only contemporaries that Mr. Howard can point to as upholding the great tradition of the literary novel are Colson Whitehead, Sally Rooney and Percival Everett. Questions of quality aside, they do not occupy the same position at the center of culture that, not long ago, fiction writers such as Toni Morrison, Philip Roth and John Updike did.</p>

<p><strong>To the Editor:</strong></p>
<p>I am an avid reader of novels, and I read Gerald Howard’s essay with great interest. I was perplexed, however, to read his statement about the novel: “It does not feed us or clothe us or, unless you get very lucky, enrich us.” I find reading novels one of the most enriching things I do in my life.</p>
<p>I have been a member of a four-woman book group for a number of years, and each month we have in-depth discussions of all sorts of American novels. Our most recent discussion, about “Bridge of Sighs,” by Richard Russo, involved exploring the character development, themes, literary style and conflicts illuminated in the novel that are part and parcel of every life. I think novels are one of the great teaching tools about life.</p>
<p>I am about to start “Audition,” by Katie Kitamura, and can hardly wait to see what I will derive from that read that will cause me to ponder and think and reflect.</p>

<p><strong>To the Editor:</strong></p>
<p>As a hobbyist author of two published yet unacclaimed novels, I appreciated Gerald Howard’s essay. I have no illusions about my own works being discovered and praised posthumously, as with Faulkner and Melville.</p>
<p>And yet I continue to write feverishly and always with the anticipation that countless hours of effort and sacrifice — often stretching into years — will only leave me in even deeper financial straits. My tireless creativity comes not from anticipated recognition but, channeling Michelangelo, from seeing “the angel in the marble” and carving until setting him free.</p>

<p><strong>To the Editor:</strong></p>
<p>Re “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/25/climate/exxon-california-lawsuit-free-speech.html">Exxon Sues California Over Laws to Disclose Emissions and Risks</a>” (news article, Oct. 27):</p>
<p>The news that Exxon Mobil has challenged California’s pathbreaking laws on climate disclosure is expected but disappointing. The challenge is part of a <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/columbialawreview.org/content/greenwashing-and-the-first-amendment/__;!!BDUfV1Et5lrpZQ!WsVb4_c5cu4mxhdWN6T3_zj_HlJf7ov_ntupXb_CAtkd-bauA_2xtqnSytFsNCz7L26BhrhghJVn6N4Q8MHPlP4C_-k$">movement</a> enlisting the First Amendment as a protective shield for business corporations against regulations that compel the reporting of important information to shareholders and the public.</p>
<p>California has joined the European Union as a global <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/thehill.com/opinion/energy-environment/4238182-in-california-and-europe-a-new-dawn-for-corporate-climate-disclosure/__;!!BDUfV1Et5lrpZQ!WsVb4_c5cu4mxhdWN6T3_zj_HlJf7ov_ntupXb_CAtkd-bauA_2xtqnSytFsNCz7L26BhrhghJVn6N4Q8MHPuZV6Ivs$">leader</a> in corporate environment disclosure laws. If Exxon wins its lawsuit, the company will be allowed to <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.scientificamerican.com/article/exxon-knew-about-climate-change-almost-40-years-ago/__;!!BDUfV1Et5lrpZQ!WsVb4_c5cu4mxhdWN6T3_zj_HlJf7ov_ntupXb_CAtkd-bauA_2xtqnSytFsNCz7L26BhrhghJVn6N4Q8MHP3TI3JIs$">continue</a> to pursue its climate-destructive policies and practices in the shadows.</p>
<p>We hope the federal courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court, will see through this attempt to misuse the First Amendment to obstruct corporate transparency.</p>

<p>Re “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/31/us/politics/supreme-court-kagan-jackson-liberal-justices.html">Liberal Justices Are Split Over Trump-Era Strategy</a>” (front page, Nov. 2):</p>
<p>Time will tell whether Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson’s combative approach or Justice Elena Kagan’s more conciliatory approach is most effective in thwarting the Trump administration’s capture of the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>Should both approaches fail, history’s harsh judgment must not be directed toward either of those two female associate justices but instead toward the man who has overseen the court’s decline and potential fall: Chief Justice John Roberts.</p>
