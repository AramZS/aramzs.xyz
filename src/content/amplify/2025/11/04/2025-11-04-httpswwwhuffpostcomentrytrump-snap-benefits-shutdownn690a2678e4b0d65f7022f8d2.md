title: Trump Says He’ll Defy Court Order And Won’t Give Out SNAP Benefits
---
<p>President <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/news/topic/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a> said Tuesday that federal food benefits won’t be distributed until after <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/news/topic/democratic-party">Democrats</a> agree to reopen the government.</p>
<p>In a <a data-vars-item-name="Truth Social post" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-target-content-id="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115492285081397189" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-unit-name="690a2678e4b0d65f7022f8d2" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115492285081397189">Truth Social post</a>, Trump said Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits “will be given only when the Radical Left Democrats open up government, which they can easily do, and not before!”</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which administers SNAP, had said Monday it would abide by a court order to pay at least partial benefits.</p>
<p>The White House and USDA did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s requests for comment.</p>
