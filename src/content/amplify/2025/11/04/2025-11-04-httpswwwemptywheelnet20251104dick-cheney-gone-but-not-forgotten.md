title: 'Dick Cheney, Gone But Not Forgotten'

<p>I had been wondering if Dick Cheney were unwell given Liz Cheney’s silence.</p>
<p>He <a data-wpel-link="external" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/04/us/politics/dick-cheney-dead.html">died yesterday</a>.</p>
<p>Amid the chaos of the Trump Administration, implementing all of Cheney’s dreams of unitary executive on Chicago’s residents and Latin American fishermen, his death didn’t even make it above the fold of the NYT.</p>
<p>This blog has written probably 500 stories on Dick Cheney — about torture, about illegal surveillance, about drone strikes, about outing Valerie Plame.</p>
<p>But the most recent are telling for his legacy:</p>

<p>We never did recover from the things Dick Cheney did to the United States. And now the precedents he established have empowered a madman.</p>
