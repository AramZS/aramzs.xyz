title: What is AWS RTB Fabric? - AWS RTB Fabric
---
<p>RTB Fabric is an AWS service that provides secure, low-latency infrastructure for connecting real-time bidding (RTB) applications. Rather than hosting applications directly, RTB Fabric acts as the connecting fabric that enables your applications to communicate efficiently over private networks instead of the public internet. You maintain complete control over your applications, data, and bidding decisions, while RTB Fabric provides the underlying infrastructure for secure, reliable connectivity. RTB Fabric is available in multiple AWS Regions. For a complete list of supported Regions, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rtb-fabric.html">RTB Fabric endpoints and quotas</a> in the <em>AWS General Reference</em>.</p>
<figure></figure><h2><figure></figure></h2>
<p>RTB Fabric enables bidirectional communication between RTB applications through a request-response model. The service creates secure pathways that allow one application to send OpenRTB requests to another application and receive responses, all while maintaining low latency and high throughput.</p>
<p>The following diagram shows the high-level architecture of RTB Fabric:</p>
<figure><img alt="RTB Fabric high-level architecture showing customer applications connecting through gateways and links" src="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/rtb-fabric/latest/userguide/images/rtb-fabric-high-level-architecture.png"/><figcaption>RTB Fabric high-level architecture showing customer applications connecting through gateways and links</figcaption></figure>
<figure></figure><p>This architecture demonstrates how RTB Fabric acts as connecting infrastructure between your applications. Requester applications connect to RTB Fabric requester gateways, which forward requests through links to RTB Fabric responder gateways. The responder gateways then forward requests to responder applications, which process them and return responses through the same pathway.</p>
<h3>RTB Fabric components</h3>
<p>RTB Fabric provides the following infrastructure components to connect your applications:</p>
<ul><li> <p><b>Requester RTB application</b> – A customer-owned and customer-operated RTB application that initiates bid requests to other RTB applications. Examples include supply-side platforms (SSPs), ad servers, and publishers. Requester applications run in customer-controlled environments and connect to RTB Fabric through AWS managed requester gateways colocated with the customer's VPC.</p> </li><li> <p><b>External requester RTB application</b> – An RTB application that runs outside AWS and does not use VPCs, but sends bid requests to RTB Fabric.</p> </li><li> <p><b>Requester gateway</b> – An AWS managed network endpoint that operates colocated with the customer's VPC to facilitate secure communication from requester applications to RTB Fabric infrastructure. Requester gateways serve as connection points that route outbound bid requests and receive responses but do not host, store, or process the customer's application logic or business data.</p> </li><li> <p><b>Link</b> – An AWS managed connection component within RTB Fabric infrastructure that enables secure, bidirectional communication between requester and responder gateways. Links are created by requester gateways and must be accepted by the AWS account that owns the responder gateway before becoming active.</p> <figure></figure> </li><li> <p><b>Responder gateway</b> – An AWS managed network endpoint that operates colocated with the customer's VPC to facilitate secure communication from RTB Fabric infrastructure to responder applications. Responder gateways serve as connection points that route inbound bid requests and return responses but do not host, store, or process the customer's application logic or business data.</p> </li><li> <p><b>Responder RTB application</b> – A customer-owned and customer-operated RTB application that receives and processes bid requests from requester applications. Examples include demand-side platforms (DSPs). Responder applications run in customer-controlled environments and connect to RTB Fabric through AWS managed responder gateways colocated with the customer's VPC.</p> </li><li> <p><b>External responder RTB application</b> – An RTB application that runs outside AWS and does not use VPCs, but receives bid requests from RTB Fabric.</p> </li><li> <p><b>Logs</b> – Optional requester and responder logs generated by links that can be delivered to external AWS services such as Amazon CloudWatch Logs or Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). Both requester and responder sides can independently configure log delivery through sampling rates for error logs and filter logs. Log delivery requires setup of log delivery sources, destinations, and appropriate AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) permissions. Logs are not stored within the RTB Fabric infrastructure.</p> </li></ul>
<figure></figure><p>Modules are configurable components that process RTB traffic flowing through your links to implement rate limiting, filtering, error handling, and other traffic management capabilities. RTB Fabric provides built-in modules for rate limiting, OpenRTB filtering, and error masking that are available at no additional charge. You can configure modules using the RTB Fabric API. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rtb-fabric/latest/userguide/modules.html">Modules</a>.</p>
<h2>Common use cases<figure></figure></h2>
<p>RTB Fabric supports three connectivity patterns. The following are three common example use cases:</p>
<ul><li> <p><b>Internal to internal</b> – Both requester and responder applications are RTB Fabric customers with single applications on each end of the link. Requester applications send requests to RTB Fabric requester gateways, which forward them through links to RTB Fabric responder gateways. Responder gateways forward requests to responder applications, which process them and return responses through the same pathway. A typical example is an SSP connecting to a DSP that both use RTB Fabric.</p> </li><li> <p><b>External to internal</b> – Requester applications are external to RTB Fabric (not RTB Fabric customers) and may represent multiple applications that can be located on or outside AWS. External requester applications send requests to RTB Fabric requester gateways, which forward them through links to RTB Fabric responder gateways. Responder gateways forward requests to responder applications, which process them and send responses back through the same pathway. A typical example is an SSP that is not on AWS connecting to a DSP that uses RTB Fabric.</p> </li><li> <p><b>Internal to external</b> – Requester applications send requests to RTB Fabric requester gateways, which forward them through links to external RTB Fabric responder gateways. External responder gateways forward requests to a single responder application that is external to RTB Fabric (not an RTB Fabric customer) and can be located on or outside AWS. The external application processes requests and returns responses through the same pathway. A typical example is an SSP that uses RTB Fabric to connect to a DSP that is not on AWS.</p> </li></ul>
<h2><figure></figure></h2>
<p>You can work with RTB Fabric in the following ways:</p>
<ul><li> <p><b>AWS Management Console</b> – The console is a browser-based interface that you can use to create and manage RTB Fabric gateways and links. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the RTB Fabric console at <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/rtbfabric">https://console.aws.amazon.com/rtbfabric<figure></figure></a>.</p> </li><li> <p><b>AWS CloudFormation</b> – Provides templates to create and manage RTB Fabric resources as code. You can use AWS CloudFormation to automate the deployment and configuration of gateways and links. For more information, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/">AWS CloudFormation User Guide</a>.</p> </li><li> <p><b>AWS Command Line Interface</b> – Provides commands for a broad set of AWS services, including RTB Fabric. It's supported on Windows, macOS, and Linux. For more information about getting started with the AWS CLI, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/">AWS Command Line Interface User Guide</a>.</p> </li><li> <p><b>AWS SDKs</b> – Provide language-specific APIs and take care of many of the connection details, such as calculating signatures, handling request retries, and error handling. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkref/latest/guide/overview.html">AWS SDKs and Tools Reference Guide</a>.</p> </li><li> <p><b>HTTPS API</b> – Provides programmatic access to RTB Fabric and AWS. The HTTPS API lets you issue HTTPS requests directly to the service. When you use the HTTPS API, you must include code to digitally sign requests using your credentials.
