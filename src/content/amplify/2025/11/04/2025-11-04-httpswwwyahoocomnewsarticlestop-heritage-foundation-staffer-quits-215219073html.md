<p>Neo-Nazi livestreamer Nick Fuentes is tearing the Heritage Foundation apart.</p>
<p>Ryan Neuhaus, the Heritage Foundation president Kevin Roberts’s chief of staff, has walked away from the conservative think tank. Neuhaus’s departure comes during an internal maelstrom sparked by Roberts’s <a data-rapid_p="17" data-ylk="slk:defense of Tucker Carlson;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/heritage-foundation-staff-revolt-over-211106525.html">defense of Tucker Carlson</a> and the ex–Fox News host’s decision to interview Fuentes, a known white supremacist and Hitler fan.</p>
<p>“Ryan was not fired. He offered his resignation, which was accepted,” a Heritage spokesperson confirmed to <a data-rapid_p="18" data-ylk="slk:The Hill;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://thehill.com/homenews/media/5586731-heritage-foundation-tucker-carlson-nick-fuentes-controversy/">The Hill</a> Monday. “Ryan is a good man, we appreciate his service, and we have no doubt he will serve the movement in another capacity.”</p>
<p>Carlson extended his national platform to Fuentes last week, offering the fringe influencer a chance to swim in the MAGA mainstream. The interview has since <a data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="1" data-ylk="slk:come under fire from several corners of the Republican Party;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/31/us/politics/tucker-carlson-nick-fuentes.html">come under fire from several corners of the Republican Party</a>, highlighting that the former primetime TV host threw the antisemite a string of softball questions while failing to challenge Fuentes’s radical and violent beliefs.</p>
<p>Neuhaus’s critical error was in resharing a number of social media posts backing his boss’s defense of Carlson, including one that appeared to attack his Heritage Foundation co-workers by arguing that those “virtue signaling” over the Fuentes interview should “resign if so outraged” and that it would be an “addition by subtraction for the institution.”</p>
<p>Roberts released a <a data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="1" data-ylk="slk:video on X;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://x.com/KevinRobertsTX/status/1983958755613262324">video on X</a> Thursday in support of Carlson and Fuentes, noting that while he disagreed with Fuentes’s beliefs, he did not believe that “canceling” the Christian nationalist Holocaust-denier was an appropriate reaction to the interview.</p>
<p>A handful of Heritage staffers, including Jason Bedrick, Jay Greene, and John Peluso, have since retweeted criticism of Roberts’s message. Conservatives outside of the institution also condemned Roberts’s perspective, including Texas Senator Ted Cruz, prompting a follow-up statement by Roberts in which he clarified that he did not condone Fuentes’s antisemitic views.</p>
<p>“Our task is to confront and challenge those poisonous ideas at every turn to prevent them from taking America to a very dark place. Join us—not to cancel—but to guide, challenge, and strengthen the conversation, and be confident as I am that our best ideas at the heart of western civilization will prevail,” Roberts <a data-rapid_p="21" data-ylk="slk:wrote;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://x.com/KevinRobertsTX/status/1984335805192532265">wrote</a> in a social media post.</p>

<p><strong>Ryan Neuhaus</strong>, the former chief of staff to Heritage Foundation President <strong>Kevin Roberts </strong>who was reassigned last Friday after Roberts released a controversial video statement defending<strong> Tucker Carlson,</strong> resigned from the organization on Monday.</p>
<p>In an email announcing Neuhaus’s reassignment last week, one day after the release of Roberts’s statement, Roberts wrote, “Ryan remains a vital part of our team and is joining the Simon Center as a Senior Advisor to work on critical issues.”</p>
<p>“Ryan’s energy and acumen will be a great benefit to our efforts to preserve the intellectual and moral underpinnings of our nation’s Founding. I know he will flourish in this new role,” he added.</p>
<p>But on Monday, The Hill’s <strong>Emily Brooks</strong> reported that Neuhaus had stepped down.</p>
<p>“Ryan was not fired. He offered his resignation, which was accepted,” a Heritage spokesperson told Brooks. “Ryan is a good man, we appreciate his service, and we have no doubt he will serve the movement in another capacity.”</p>
<p>From Brooks’s <a data-rapid_p="13" data-ylk="slk:report;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://thehill.com/homenews/media/5586731-heritage-foundation-tucker-carlson-nick-fuentes-controversy/">report</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Neuhaus had angered Heritage staff and other conservative movement allies after he had reposted a number of messages of support for Roberts and his defense of Carlson on social media, including one particularly controversial statement that Heritage employees who were “virtual signaling” in wake of the remarks should “resign if so outraged,” and that it “would be addition by subtraction for the institution.”</p></blockquote>
<p>After Carlson hosted infamous white nationalist <strong>Nick Fuentes</strong> for a friendly interview last week, Roberts <a data-rapid_p="14" data-ylk="slk:issued a statement;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/heritage-foundation-defends-tucker-carlson-035038726.html">issued a statement</a> denouncing Carlson’s critics in harsh terms.</p>
<p>“We will always defend truth, we will always defend America, and we will always defend our friends against the slander of bad actors who serve someone else’s agenda. That includes Tucker Carlson, who remains – and as I have said before, always will be – a close friend of the Heritage Foundation. The venomous coalition attacking him are sowing division. Their attempt to cancel him will fail,” he declared.</p>
<p>Roberts was criticized by a wide range of conservatives, including <a data-rapid_p="15" data-ylk="slk:many on his own payroll;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/nazis-bad-heritage-foundation-staffers-143402354.html">many on his own payroll</a>, over his comments.</p>
