title: Meet the Aunties for Zohran

<p>New York City's 2025 mayoral race has captivated the nation, not only because an unlikely candidate is leading in the polls—the 33-year-old South Asian Muslim democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani—but because of the multicultural, multigenerational coalition backing his campaign. On the night of the Democratic primary results, as white Gen Z transplants from Ohio stood shoulder-to-shoulder with hijab-wearing South Asian women in their sixties, it was clear something extraordinary was happening in American politics.</p>
<p>When Mamdani claimed victory that June evening, he began with gratitude for one very specific group. “This is the victory of the Bangladeshi auntie who knocked on door after door until her feet throbbed and her knuckles ached," he said.</p>
<p>It was a grand moment for a community that makes up just <a data-node-id="2.1" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="0.7% of New York City's " data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.pewresearch.org/race-and-ethnicity/fact-sheet/asian-americans-bangladeshis-in-the-u-s/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" href="https://www.pewresearch.org/race-and-ethnicity/fact-sheet/asian-americans-bangladeshis-in-the-u-s/"><u data-node-id="2.1.0">0.7% of New York City's </u></a>population but punched far above its weight in political organizing—and it was especially significant for the women within it, who are rarely recognized for their political power.</p>

<p>"These women are militant," says 56-year-old Kazi Fauzia, director of organizing at <a data-node-id="5.1" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="DRUM Beats" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.drumbeatsnyc.org/who-we-are" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" href="https://www.drumbeatsnyc.org/who-we-are"><u data-node-id="5.1.0">DRUM Beats</u></a>, which represents New York City's working-class South Asian and Indo-Caribbean populations. "They know how to knock on doors, phone bank, and talk every day with people in the community. We've struggled for a long time to bring our people to the polls, and this is the result of [their efforts]."</p>
<p>Kazi moved to the United States in 2008 as an undocumented immigrant and immediately experienced firsthand the challenges experienced every day by women, immigrants, and working-class New Yorkers. She joined DRUM Beats as a community organizer and helped mobilize hundreds of Bangladeshi, Pakistani, and Indo-Caribbean immigrant women throughout the years. Those women represent a significant yet underrated political force in New York.</p>
<p>First-generation immigrant women of color—mothers, grandmothers, aunties—powered Mamdani's historic campaign from mosque basements to bodega storefronts. Jennifer Mathura is a single mother who immigrated from Trinidad 15 years ago and is a chapter leader at DRUM Beats in Southern Queens, where large communities of South Asian and Indo-Caribbean immigrants live. She believes that women are crucial for finding out the needs of the community. “We set up our table and talk to the members of the community that are walking by and learn about their issues."</p>

<p>When Mamdani specifically thanked Bangladeshi women in his victory speech, Kazi understood the deeper meaning: "Yes, Zohran specifically named Bangladeshi women, but I think he meant all of the immigrant women who spent hours canvassing for him." <a data-node-id="9.1" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="About 36% of the city's " data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://popfactfinder.planning.nyc.gov/explorer/cities/New%20York%20City?acsTopics=%2Csoc-placeOfBirth&amp;source=acs-current" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" href="https://popfactfinder.planning.nyc.gov/explorer/cities/New%20York%20City?acsTopics=%2Csoc-placeOfBirth&amp;source=acs-current"><u data-node-id="9.1.0">About 36% of the city's </u></a>population is foreign-born, making it one of the most diverse cities in America. Representing Bangladeshi, Caribbean, Pakistani, Haitian, Egyptian, and Spanish-speaking communities, women organized across WhatsApp groups and kitchen tables, mobilizing voters in a dozen languages and interpreting at polling sites. They weren't just making samosas and empanadas for campaign events—they were architecting the campaign itself.</p>
<p>Alicé Nascimento, policy director at <a data-node-id="10.1" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="New York Communities for Change (NYCC)" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.nycommunities.org/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" href="https://www.nycommunities.org/"><u data-node-id="10.1.0">New York Communities for Change (NYCC)</u></a>, puts the women's impact in stark terms: “Without these women, Zohran wouldn't be anywhere near this close to the general election. They built his campaign from nothing. Their work was the difference between polling below 1% just a few months before and winning the primary."</p>
<p>The numbers tell the story of their organizing prowess. More <a data-node-id="11.1" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="than 300 DRUM Beats volunteers, speaking nearly a dozen languages, knocked on at least 10,000 doors in the campaign's early weeks" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/19/zohran-mamdani-muslim-south-asian-new-york-mayoral-race" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/19/zohran-mamdani-muslim-south-asian-new-york-mayoral-race"><u data-node-id="11.1.0">than 300 DRUM Beats volunteers, speaking nearly a dozen languages, knocked on at least 10,000 doors in the campaign's early weeks</u></a>. The beauty of their organizing, Kazi explains, is that it transcended language barriers: "Even when some DRUM Beats volunteers didn't speak English and some Democratic Socialist members didn't speak ethnic languages, they worked together, communicated, knocked on hundreds of doors a day, and returned with smiles."</p>

<p>Women have long been the backbone of immigrant justice work in New York, and nowhere is that clearer than in the organizations that backed Mamdani. Shortly after he announced his mayoral run, a <a data-node-id="13.1" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="coalition of community organizations" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.nycommunities.org/2025mayoralendorsement" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" href="https://www.nycommunities.org/2025mayoralendorsement"><u data-node-id="13.1.0">coalition of community organizations</u></a> representing more than 50,000 working-class New Yorkers from Black and immigrant communities endorsed him. This nod of approval came after a multilingual interview process conducted by more than 100 working-class leaders of color across four boroughs. It was led by DRUM Beats, which counts more than 75% of its membership and leadership as women and girls; NYCC, where women lead mobilizations on housing and labor issues; and <a data-node-id="13.3" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="CAAAV" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://caaav.org/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" href="https://caaav.org/"><u data-node-id="13.3.0">CAAAV</u></a>, founded by Asian women in 1986, which has always placed working-class immigrant women at the forefront of housing struggles.</p>
<p>Julie Xu, CAAAV's Chinatown Tenants Union lead organizer who coordinated volunteers for Mamdani's campaign, emphasizes why this coalition mattered. “It was really important in establishing his credibility as a candidate. Our organizations have decades of relationship and power-building, and we were willing to do the backbreaking work to make it happen."</p>
<p>The historical context is crucial. Immigrant women have always been the quiet architects of change in New York City. In the early 20th century, Jewish and Italian garment workers—many of them teenage girls—led strikes that reshaped labor laws. Chinese immigrant women in Chinatown organized tenant associations that forced the city to confront slum conditions. Puerto Rican and Dominican mothers in the Bronx built tenant unions during the 1970s housing crisis. Caribbean women transformed the city's care economy. Beginning in the mid-20th century, thousands of Jamaican and other Caribbean women found work as home health aides and domestic workers. Their advocacy ultimately shaped the nation's first <a data-node-id="15.1" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Domestic Workers' Bill of Rights in 2010." data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.domesticworkersunitednyc.org/history" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" href="https://www.domesticworkersunitednyc.org/history"><u data-node-id="15.1.0">Domestic Workers' Bill of Rights in 2010.</u></a></p>

<p>South Asian immigrants are newer to this political landscape. The Asian Exclusion Act of 1924 effectively closed immigration until the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965. Bangladeshi, Indian, and Pakistani communities took root in Queens and Brooklyn only in recent decades, yet they quickly learned the organizing traditions established by previous generations of immigrant women.</p>
<p>"Usually, more women show up at DRUM Beats organizing meetings because men are busy working and earning money. Women have a more innate sense of what communities need to survive," shares Samira Jabina, another DRUM Beats chapter leader. Samira immigrated from Pakistan the weekend before September 11, 2001. Witnessing the deep Islamophobia and harsh working conditions her husband faced as a gas station worker and undocumented immigrant compelled her to become a community organizer, and she joined DRUM Beats as a volunteer in 2006.</p>

<p>This gendered division of labor within immigrant communities is an unrecognized political asset. When men often work multiple jobs or long hours, women become the bridge between household needs and community organizing. They're the ones navigating school systems, healthcare bureaucracy, and housing issues—giving them intimate knowledge of policy failures and potential solutions.</p>
<p>"The intervention of immigrant women in the housing movement has been to reshape our understanding of home. Home isn't just your apartment unit. If your neighborhood isn't safe, you're not safe in your home. If ICE is in the city, you're not safe until they're gone. That politicization comes from generations of women," explains CAAAV's communications manager Irene Hsu.</p>
<p>Mamdani's campaign's power lies in addressing everyday realities across working-class lines, often made up of immigrants. Polls consistently showed affordability as voters' top concern, and <a data-node-id="22.1" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Mamdani has promised concrete solutions—a rent freeze, stronger tenant rights enforcement, 200,000 affordable housing units over the next decade, affordable childcare, groceries, and free buses." data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.zohranfornyc.com/platform" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" href="https://www.zohranfornyc.com/platform"><u data-node-id="22.1.0">Mamdani has promised concrete solutions—a rent freeze, stronger tenant rights enforcement, 200,000 affordable housing units over the next decade, affordable childcare, groceries, and free buses.</u></a></p>
<p>"We organize some of the poorest people in New York, and it's really hard for them to stay here even though they're the ones taking care of our children, cleaning apartments, doing the work that often goes unnoticed," explains Winsome Pendergrass, a NYCC organizer in her 70s who works with predominantly Black and Latino communities and immigrated to New York from Jamaica in the early 2000s.</p>
<p>Like many immigrants of her generation, she was initially skeptical of Mamdani. But his platform convinced her that he was what New York City needed to address critical issues like the housing crisis, childcare needs, transportation, and general financial hardship in a city that's becoming increasingly unaffordable for the working class.</p>
<p>"It's something that childcare providers and parents have been saying for years—universal childcare, making sure people can stay in this city. Why is the richest country in the world, the richest city in the world, not investing in childcare? Not even fixing our middle schools? At my granddaughter's middle school in our Brooklyn neighborhood, there weren't enough chairs. Kids were leaning in corners or sitting in broken chairs no one repaired," explains Pendergrass.</p>
<p>These women's economic experiences reflect broader patterns. Foreign-born workers in New York City made up nearly <a data-node-id="26.1" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="49% of the self-employed population in 2023" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.osc.ny.gov/files/reports/osdc/pdf/immigrants-labor-force-one-pager.pdf" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" href="https://www.osc.ny.gov/files/reports/osdc/pdf/immigrants-labor-force-one-pager.pdf"><u data-node-id="26.1.0">49% of the self-employed population in 2023</u></a>, often out of necessity rather than choice. Many work in what economists call "essential" jobs—domestic work, food service, healthcare support, and childcare—that keep the city functioning but offer little economic security.</p>

<p>Julie Xu, Chinatown Tenants Union lead organizer at CAAAV, says Mamdani's understanding of issues that women across the city face every day helped convince women organizers in CAAAV's Chinatown sectors to back him. “We have a tenant rights leader, Miss Chen, a garment worker in Chinatown for 20 years. Low-cost childcare was what allowed her to work 10–12 hours daily. That reality shaped the campaign—making sure people could actually live while they worked."</p>
<p>Nascimento describes why Mamdani's message cut through to immigrant women who have been organizing and advocating for their communities for decades. “The reason people felt seen is because he listens, because he's been around, and because he comes from a movement space that centers the needs of working people—the taxi worker, the home care worker. That's what he prioritizes."</p>
<p>But this trust wasn't built overnight. Shahana Masum, a Bangladeshi community advocate, explains, "I've known Zohran since before he became an assemblymember representing Queens in 2020. He always listened to concerns and valued everyone's opinions, especially women. On election day, when the votes came in, Jews, Christians, Muslims—we were all screaming 'Allahu Akbar.' That's how we celebrated together."</p>

<p>The Bangladeshi community's political mobilization is particularly noteworthy given its smaller numbers and the fact that many members are recent arrivals. As Kazi noted with characteristic humor, "I asked Zohran playfully why he named aunties when he calls me <em data-node-id="32.1">sister</em>. But all jokes aside, it's a representation of all the women who wholeheartedly believed in his platform long before even our men did."</p>
<p>After 9/11, Bangladeshi and Pakistani women in Queens mobilized against Islamophobic surveillance, opening their living rooms for know-your-rights training when mosques were under government watch. Wives of Bangladeshi taxi drivers, managing household survival amid crushing taxi medallion debt, stood beside their husbands in union struggles that reshaped city labor politics.</p>
<p>In 2021, when the New York Taxi Workers Alliance launched a 15-day hunger strike against the crushing medallion debt that had driven some immigrant drivers to suicide, Assemblymember Mamdani joined them. For the wives and mothers of drivers—women who had been holding families together amid financial ruin—his solidarity was transformative. The strike secured $450 million in debt relief, but for these women, Mamdani’s willingness to fast alongside immigrant drivers proved he understood that their struggles were interconnected, and that he was prepared to share in their suffering to fight for concrete solutions.</p>
<p>Mamdani's rise proves that grassroots organizing led by working-class immigrant women can redefine political power in New York. These aunties—often overlooked and underestimated—built a candidate from the ground up, mobilizing a multiracial coalition that understood identity through shared struggle rather than ethnicity alone.</p>
<p>The son of Indian-born parents from Uganda who became a U.S. citizen in 2018, Mamdani may be the face of the campaign, but his appeal extended far beyond his South Asian identity. What resonated across neighborhoods was a shared working-class experience: the daily pressures of keeping roofs over heads, keeping children fed, and navigating debt, wages, and housing instability. After three rounds of ranked-choice calculations, he captured 56% of the primary vote, moving from relative obscurity to potential mayor, and if all goes well tomorrow, he'll soon be installed in Gracie Mansion. But the organizers have no intention of quitting once the race is run.</p>
<p>"Once he's in City Hall, if he goes back on his promises, I will hold him accountable. His smile and good looks won't save him then," explains Kazi.</p>
