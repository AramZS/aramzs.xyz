(Demetrius Freeman/The Washington Post)</figcaption></figure><p>A large portion of pro-Democrat ads in the 2025 general election in New Jersey and Virginia mentioned Trump, according to data from AdImpact. Democrats spent nearly $18 million on general election ads there mentioning Trump, investing $34.4 million on ads that did not. By comparison, Republicans spent $1.3 million on ads in those states mentioning Trump and $37.7 million on ads that did not.</p><p class="rw-outer-content"><span>Some content could not be imported from the original document.</span> <a href="https://washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/11/04/election-virginia-new-jersey-trump-democrats/">View content ↗ </a></p><p>The Democratic gubernatorial nominee in Virginia, Abigail Spanberger, has argued that the cost of living for voters in her home state is too high, pointing in part to the president’s trade agenda, U.S. DOGE Service<i> </i>cuts and the ongoing government shutdown. New Jersey Democratic gubernatorial nominee Mikie Sherrill <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/10/26/new-jersey-governor-ciattarelli-sherrill/">rarely misses an opportunity</a> to tie her opponent to the president. In California, Democrats have focused heavily on Trump, hoping to capitalize on blue state anger with the president to pass a new congressional map.</p><figure><p class="rw-outer-content"><span>Some content could not be imported from the original document.</span> <a href="https://washingtonpost.com/video/local/history-on-the-ballot-what-to-know-about-vas-election/2025/11/02/2d81cce7-a218-4463-9a2f-ec530e82d610_video.html">View content ↗ </a></p><figcaption>Virginia will hold its election Tuesday for governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general and all 100 seats in the House of Delegates. (Video: Joy Sung, Gregory S. Schneider/The Washington Post)</figcaption></figure><p>Democrats have spent nearly a decade campaigning against Trump in a range of elections. If they are successful Tuesday in races where they ran heavily against the president, it could fuel efforts to reprise the strategies in the midterms next year. If not, the outcomes might prompt calls in the party to focus their energy on other matters.</p><p class="rw-outer-content"><span>Some content could not be imported from the original document.</span> <a href="https://washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/11/04/election-virginia-new-jersey-trump-democrats/">View content ↗ </a></p><p>The election will also test Republicans’ ability to overcome Trump’s low approval ratings and appeal to his loyal political base. New Jersey GOP<b> </b>gubernatorial nominee Jack Ciattarelli, for example, has aligned himself with Trump but downplayed the president’s role in the contest.</p><p class="rw-outer-content"><span>Some content could not be imported from the original document.</span> <a href="https://washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/11/04/election-virginia-new-jersey-trump-democrats/">View content ↗ </a></p><p>There are also questions about whether Trump’s supporters — which included an expanded coalition in 2024 after <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/11/06/trump-coalition-republicans-realignment/">he made inroads</a> with Latino voters, first-time voters and others — will show up for Republicans when he is not on the ballot. Trump himself has <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/11/01/trump-election-republicans-virgina-new-jersey/">not been especially active</a> in this year’s campaigns.</p><h3>Will Mikie Sherrill hang on in New Jersey, or will Republicans spring an upset?</h3><p>The open race for governor of New Jersey has narrowed in recent weeks, with polls showing Sherrill leading Ciattarelli by single digits. Democrats have long hoped for a clean sweep of this year’s governor’s races. They hold a clear advantage in Virginia, but New Jersey is not a sure bet.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/QEDRKT2734OCOWVTX7OKHIZX5Q.jpg"/><figcaption>New Jersey Democratic gubernatorial candidate Mikie Sherrill greets supporters at her rally during a campaign event with former president Barack Obama on Saturday in Newark. (Angelina Katsanis/AP)</figcaption></figure><p>Though New Jersey is blue-leaning, Ciattarelli has returned as a competitive candidate in the gubernatorial race. He outperformed pre-election polls and fell three points short of winning the race against incumbent Gov. Phil Murphy (D) four years ago.</p><p class="rw-outer-content"><span>Some content could not be imported from the original document.</span> <a href="https://washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/11/04/election-virginia-new-jersey-trump-democrats/">View content ↗ </a></p><p>This time around, Democrats are feeling the squeeze from voters who have soured on Murphy and the Democratic-controlled state legislature — particularly over their handling of cost-of-living issues. In addition, their gubernatorial candidate in the open race, Sherrill, has been scrutinized for being too buttoned up on the campaign trail.</p><p class="rw-outer-content"><span>Some content could not be imported from the original document.</span> <a href="https://washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/11/04/election-virginia-new-jersey-trump-democrats/">View content ↗ </a></p><p class="rw-outer-content"><span>Some content could not be imported from the original document.</span> <a href="https://washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/11/04/election-virginia-new-jersey-trump-democrats/">View content ↗ </a></p><p>Ciattarelli, a businessman and former state lawmaker, is a former Trump critic turned supporter who is running with the president’s endorsement. Sherrill, a Navy veteran who in 2018 flipped a House district held by Republicans for decades, is attempting to convince voters that she would be a change agent as governor, making an ambitious pledge to put a freeze on electric utility rates and stand up to Trump.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/H2ZJ3JDES7QBIIESNTRPPEM3EA.jpg"/><figcaption>Republican gubernatorial nominee Jack Ciattarelli, center, takes a selfie with supporters on Saturday in Westfield, New Jersey. (Andres Kudacki/Getty Images)</figcaption></figure><p>In the final stretch of the contest, both candidates have focused on the cost of living, deploying television ads highlighting their efforts to combat high costs in the Garden State. Sherrill <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DQMwxC8DLk-/">pledged</a> in a final ad of the campaign to drive costs down. And Ciattarelli similarly vowed to tackle unaffordability, saying, “housing, tax and electricity bills are crushing the middle class.”</p><p class="rw-outer-content"><span>Some content could not be imported from the original document.</span> <a href="https://washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/11/04/election-virginia-new-jersey-trump-democrats/">View content ↗ </a></p><p>Republicans are hoping Ciattarelli can capitalize on the inroads Trump made in the blue state in 2024. No state besides New York shifted more toward Trump than New Jersey. He lost by about six percentage points, compared to his roughly 16-point defeat in 2020. However, Trump’s endorsement doesn’t clearly spell good news for Ciattarelli’s gubernatorial prospects, given that the president’s approval rating is now underwater in New Jersey.</p><p class="rw-outer-content"><span>Some content could not be imported from the original document.</span> <a href="https://washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/11/04/election-virginia-new-jersey-trump-democrats/">View content ↗ </a></p><h3>How much of a problem will Jay Jones pose for Virginia Democrats? Will Republicans capitalize?</h3><p>The other high-profile contest Republicans are hopeful about is the race for attorney general in Virginia.</p><p>Republicans in the state <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/10/03/jones-texts-virginia-attorney-general/">have seized on the recent revelation</a> that the Democratic nominee for attorney general, Jay Jones, sent text messages to a lawmaker in 2022 describing a hypothetical scenario of shooting the Republican speaker of the Virginia House and discussing urinating on the future graves of other political opponents. Jones has since apologized, but Republicans — including Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, the nominee for governor — have released ads seeking to tie Democratic campaigns to Jones’s controversy.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/E6PO4IFAUENO2BSYHSHG4YH4KA.JPG"/><figcaption>Jay Jones (D), a candidate for Virginia attorney general, greets voters at Hungary Creek Middle School in Glen Allen on June 17. (Parker Michels-Boyce/For The Washington Post)</figcaption></figure><p>Democrats <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/10/08/jay-jones-texts-democrats-violence-republicans/">have largely stood behind Jones</a>, even as they condemned his texts — worrying some in the party who want to draw a firm line against political violence and violent rhetoric, and prompting accusations of hypocrisy from Republicans.</p><p>The incumbent, state Attorney General Jason Miyares (R), has Trump’s endorsement. Miyares has been sharply critical of Jones.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2SUY5JL5EO32ZDOD55EV756LPU.jpg"/><figcaption>Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares speaks at a CPAC Latino Rally for Virginia on Oct. 25 in Sterling.

Cuomo and Republican Curtis Sliwa, Mamdani, 34, has <a href="https://img.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/06/26/zohran-mamdani-social-media-memes/?itid=ms_1">embraced</a> social media to build a movement around his candidacy, zeroing in on affordability as a core message. He has championed ideas such as free public transportation, city-run grocery stores and universal child care, while also pursuing higher taxes on wealthier residents.</p><p>If he wins, party establishment figures who were <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/democratic-national-committee-zohran-mamdani-endorsement-nyc-mayor-rcna237025">slow</a> to endorse Mamdani’s candidacy are likely to face more questions about his governance. And his dynamic with Trump, who has suggested Mamdani would face “problems with Washington like no Mayor in the history of our once-great city,” while Mamdani has called himself “Donald Trump’s worst nightmare,” will also be under the spotlight. Trump <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/11/03/mamdani-trump-mayor-newyork/" target="_blank">endorsed Cuomo</a> on Monday.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WO57BHLDMKY3W2NULDMMEO2OZI.jpg"/><figcaption>New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani (D) speaks during a campaign event on Saturday in New York City. (Stephanie Keith/Getty Images)</figcaption></figure><p>In a Democratic Party desperate to elevate new and compelling voices, Mamdani’s rise has been a refreshing development for some who see him as a strong communicator. But it’s been cause for concern for others, who <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/10/28/mamdani-newyork-socialist-democrats/">worry</a> that GOP attempts to cast Democrats as extremists will be more effective with a prominent democratic socialist elected to lead the country’s most populous city. Some have also been troubled by Mamdani’s comments about Israel. Mamdani, who <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/10/18/new-york-city-mamdani-cuomo-mayors-election/">would become</a> the first Muslim mayor of a city that has <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/10/25/mamdani-israel-newyork-jews/">the largest Jewish and Muslim populations in the country</a>, has said he does not believe Israel should exist as a Jewish state.</p><p class="rw-outer-content"><span>Some content could not be imported from the original document.</span> <a href="https://washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/11/04/election-virginia-new-jersey-trump-democrats/">View content ↗ </a></p><figure><p class="rw-outer-content"><span>Some content could not be imported from the original document.</span> <a href="https://washingtonpost.com/video/politics/new-york-citys-mayoral-race-enters-the-homestretch/2025/11/03/48d7dd78-94f4-4366-83b3-4ee58cc8ba6e_video.html">View content ↗ </a></p><figcaption>What Zohran Mamdani, Andrew Cuomo, and Curtis Sliwa said on the final day of the NYC mayoral race.

Gavin Newsom (D) is pushing that could serve as Democrats’ first concrete counterpunch against Republican efforts in several states to redraw congressional district maps in their favor. Polls show it is favored to succeed. If it does, the state can bypass its independent redistricting commission and adopt a new map that could add up to five Democratic U.S. House seats.</p><p>The battle over redistricting in California has attracted massive spending and big-name surrogates, with Newsom’s committee bringing in former president Barack Obama and other nationally known Democrats to star in ads supporting Prop 50 and framing the campaign as a way to fight Trump directly.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RDVWYPIF2KBZWY2BADJ3EN6QNE.JPG"/><figcaption>California Gov.

But Prop 50’s advocates, including Newsom, have sounded confident notes. For Newsom, a win would also be a welcome accomplishment ahead of a 2028 presidential campaign many Democrats expect him to launch.</p></body></html>
