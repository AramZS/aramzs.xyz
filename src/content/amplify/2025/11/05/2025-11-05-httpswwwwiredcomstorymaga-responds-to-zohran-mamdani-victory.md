<p>MAGA influencers, Republican lawmakers, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_DCrfVp3uU">conspiracy theorists</a> all responded to <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-big-interview-podcast-zohran-mamdani/">Zohran Mamdani’s</a> mayoral victory in New York by pushing far-right anti-immigrant and Islamophobic rhetoric, and claiming the city had fallen.</p>
<p>Mamdani, who campaigned on progressive issues and identifies as a democratic socialist, will be the youngest New York mayor in over a century. He will also be the city’s first Muslim and South Asian mayor. With over 90 percent of the two million votes counted on Wednesday morning, Mamdani held an almost 9 point lead over former governor Andrew Cuomo, with Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa trailing far behind at just 7 percent of the vote.</p>
<p>“The conventional wisdom would tell you that I am far from the perfect candidate,” Mamdani said during his victory speech on Tuesday night. “I am young, despite my best efforts to grow older. I am Muslim. I am a democratic socialist. And most damning of all, I refuse to apologize for any of this.”</p>
<p>It is Mamdani’s embrace of New York’s immigrants and his own Muslim upbringing that most of the MAGAsphere fixated on, calling him everything from a “a third world communist” to a “Marxist” and “a jihadi.”</p>
<p>“A third world communist won in New York because New York is a third world city now,” right-wing podcaster Matt Walsh wrote on X. “This is mass migration working exactly as intended. It isn’t anymore complicated than that.”</p>
<p>White House deputy chief of staff for policy Stephen Miller, the architect of the Trump administration’s immigration policy, meanwhile <a data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://x.com/StephenM/status/1985907043929145605"}' data-offer-url="https://x.com/StephenM/status/1985907043929145605" href="https://x.com/StephenM/status/1985907043929145605">posted a screenshot</a> from a 2023 report on <a href="http://nyc.gov">nyc.gov</a> website that showed around 50 percent of New York households contain at least one immigrant, without adding a comment.</p>
<p>Others suggested that New York’s election result would be a harbinger of things to come across the rest of the US. “Democrats in New York City have chosen a true extremist and Marxist, and the consequences will be felt across our entire nation,” speaker of the House Mike Johnson <a data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://x.com/MikeJohnson/status/1985900698102272091"}' data-offer-url="https://x.com/MikeJohnson/status/1985900698102272091" href="https://x.com/MikeJohnson/status/1985900698102272091">wrote on X</a>. “Zohran Mamdani’s election cements the Democrat Party's transformation to a radical, big-government socialist party."</p>
<p>Many others focused on Mamdani’s Muslim faith, pushing Islamophobic conspiracy theories about the future of New York. “America is about to become a very violent country, Mamdani will encourage Muslims to commit political assassinations to acquire power and silence critics,” conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer <a data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://x.com/LauraLoomer/status/1985931496406827375"}' data-offer-url="https://x.com/LauraLoomer/status/1985931496406827375" href="https://x.com/LauraLoomer/status/1985931496406827375">wrote</a> in one of her many posts about the election on X.</p>
<p>Loomer also slammed billionaire Bill Ackman, who <a data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://x.com/BillAckman/status/1985909487363113246"}' data-offer-url="https://x.com/BillAckman/status/1985909487363113246" href="https://x.com/BillAckman/status/1985909487363113246">congratulated Mamdani</a> on Tuesday night despite his intense campaign against him over the last few months. “Never congratulate a jihadi,” Loomer <a data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://x.com/LauraLoomer/status/1985983952587538702"}' data-offer-url="https://x.com/LauraLoomer/status/1985983952587538702" href="https://x.com/LauraLoomer/status/1985983952587538702">wrote</a> in response to Ackman’s post. “Mamdani wants you dead because you are Jewish and American.”</p>
<p>Mamdani’s campaign promoted religious tolerance and highlighted the fact that he grew up in an interfaith household, where his father was Muslim and his mother was Hindu. Mamdani ran a campaign on making New York affordable for working class residents, promoting policies including free childcare, a network of city-owned grocery stores, and more to tackle the cost of living crisis. “I don't think that we should have billionaires because, frankly, it is so much money in a moment of such inequality,” Mamdani told NBC’s <a data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/zohran-mamdani-says-dont-think-billionaires-rcna215821"}' data-offer-url="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/zohran-mamdani-says-dont-think-billionaires-rcna215821" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/zohran-mamdani-says-dont-think-billionaires-rcna215821">Meet the Press</a> in July.</p>
<p>Some compared Mamdani to London’s mayor Sadiq Khan, who was also his city’s first Muslim mayor.</p>
<p>“New York, be afraid, be very afraid,” Dan Wootton, a pro-MAGA influencer based in the UK, <a data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://x.com/danwootton/status/1985899656484635049"}' data-offer-url="https://x.com/danwootton/status/1985899656484635049" href="https://x.com/danwootton/status/1985899656484635049">wrote</a> on X. “Zohran Mamdani will take you to a very dark place. Just like Sadiq Khan has done to London. The woke MSM are despicable in their celebrations tonight.”</p>
<p>Former Trump adviser Steve Bannon, <a data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://x.com/Bannons_WarRoom/status/1985913923682332702"}' data-offer-url="https://x.com/Bannons_WarRoom/status/1985913923682332702" href="https://x.com/Bannons_WarRoom/status/1985913923682332702">speaking on his War Room podcast</a> on Tuesday night, also compared Mamdani to Khan, and said the new mayor would make New York the “wokeist city on planet earth,” while describing the new mayor as everything from a “neo-Marxist” to a “jihadist.”</p>
<p>Bannon also suggested that the Department of Homeland Security “denaturalize” Mamdani and “ship him back to Uganda,” where he was born. Mamdani is a dual citizen of the US and Uganda.</p>
<p>Other influencers and politicians claimed disaster for New York. “Mamdani will usher in a crime wave the likes of which New York has not seen since the 1990s,” far-right influencer Jack Posobiec said on Fox News Tuesday evening, citing something TPUSA cofounder <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/arizona-teachers-death-threats-charlie-kirk/">Charlie Kirk</a> posted on X earlier this year.</p>
<p>Similarly, Florida representative Randy Fine <a data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://x.com/RepFine/status/1985899881639088504"}' data-offer-url="https://x.com/RepFine/status/1985899881639088504" href="https://x.com/RepFine/status/1985899881639088504">wrote on X</a> that “New York City has fallen,” adding: “America is next if we don’t stop it.” Nancy Mace took a break from posting about her <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/nancy-mace-berates-cops-airport-meltdown/">expletive-filled airport tirade</a> to issue a prophecy: “Bread lines about to be a real thing in New York. Congrats.”</p>
<p>In Texas, governor Greg Abbott echoed the sentiment. “Join me for a moment of silence for NYC,” Abbott <a data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://x.com/gregabbott_tx/status/1985898940248568033?s=46&amp;t=Vpl75i4OJVZ5OPVSiTqxHw"}' data-offer-url="https://x.com/gregabbott_tx/status/1985898940248568033?s=46&amp;t=Vpl75i4OJVZ5OPVSiTqxHw" href="https://x.com/gregabbott_tx/status/1985898940248568033?s=46&amp;t=Vpl75i4OJVZ5OPVSiTqxHw">wrote on X</a>. “Thoughts &amp; prayers.”</p>
<p>President Donald Trump, meanwhile, hasn’t yet responded to Mamdani’s victory in his home city. Mamdani directly addressed the president in his victory speech, and said “if anyone can show a nation betrayed by Donald Trump how to defeat him, it is the city that gave rise to him."</p>
<p>Almost simultaneously, Trump cryptically <a data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115495225031046506"}' data-offer-url="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115495225031046506" href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115495225031046506">posted on Truth Social</a>: “...AND SO IT BEGINS!.”</p>
