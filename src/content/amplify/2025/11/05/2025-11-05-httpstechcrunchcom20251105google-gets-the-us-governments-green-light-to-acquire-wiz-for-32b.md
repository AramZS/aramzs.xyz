title: Google gets the US government’s green light to acquire Wiz for $32B

<p>Google’s $32 billion acquisition of cloud security company Wiz has moved a step closer toward the finish line.</p>
<p>Wiz CEO Assaf Rappaport said at a Wall Street Journal event on Tuesday, as <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/googles-32-billion-deal-wiz-clears-doj-antitrust-review-wiz-ceo-tells-wsj-2025-11-05/">reported by Reuters</a>, that the acquisition had cleared its antitrust review by the U.S. Department of Justice. Rappaport added that while a milestone, the deal still has a way to go before it officially closes.</p>
<p>TechCrunch reached out to Wiz for more information regarding the timeline to close.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/22/wiz-walks-away-from-googles-23b-acquisition-offer-read-the-ceos-note-to-employees/">Google initially approached Wiz in 2024</a> with an offer to buy the startup for $23 billion. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/28/wiz-ceo-explains-why-he-turned-down-a-23-billion-deal/">Wiz walked away from that offer</a> and Rappaport said, at the time, that he felt the business could grow to be a lot bigger than that.</p>
<p>He was right. Google and Wiz <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/17/google-revives-talks-to-acquire-wiz-at-higher-valuation/">revived acquisition talks in the first few months of 2025</a>, and Google announced it was buying <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/18/google-is-buying-wiz-for-32b-to-beef-up-in-cloud-security/">Wiz for $32 billion</a> in March.</p>
<p>Bloomberg <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/googles-32-billion-deal-wiz-gets-antitrust-review-bloomberg-news-reports-2025-06-13/">initially reported</a> that the deal was under antitrust review in June. The deal is expected to close in early 2026, according to Reuters.</p>
