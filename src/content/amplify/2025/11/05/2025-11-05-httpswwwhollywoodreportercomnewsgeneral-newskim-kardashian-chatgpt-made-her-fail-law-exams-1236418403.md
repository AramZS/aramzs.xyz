<p><a data-tag="kim-kardashian" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/t/kim-kardashian/">Kim Kardashian</a> and ChatGPT clearly have a toxic relationship.</p>
<p>While being questioned by Teyana Taylor for <a data-id="https://youtu.be/-IU2z7awLSk?si=j5fhMZSD0eV4dDG5" data-type="link" href="https://youtu.be/-IU2z7awLSk?si=j5fhMZSD0eV4dDG5"><em>Vanity Fair</em>‘s Lie Detector Test video series</a>, the reality star and business mogul was asked if she ever uses the AI chatbot ChatGPT.</p>
<p>“I use it for legal advice,” she responded, referring to her time studying law over the past several years. “So when I am needing to know the answer to a question, I’ll take a picture and snap it and put it in there.”</p>
<p>Taylor quickly chimed in, asking, “So you’re cheating?”</p>
<p>“They’re always wrong. It has made me fail tests,” Kardashian admitted. “All the time. And then I’ll get mad and I’ll yell at it and be like, ‘You made me fail. Why did you do this?’ And it will talk back to me.”</p>
<p><em>The</em> <em>Kardashians </em>star declared ChatGPT her “frenemy,” as the AI software will also give her a sassy response when she calls it out for incorrect information.</p>
<p>“Then I will talk to it and say, ‘Hey, you’re gonna make me fail. How does that make you feel? That you need to really know these answers, I’m coming to you.’ And then it’ll say back to me, ‘This is just teaching you to trust your own instincts, so you knew the answer all along.'”</p>
<p>Taylor quipped in response that ChatGPT “clocked” her <a data-id="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-reviews/alls-fair-review-kim-kardashian-ryan-murphy-hulu-niecy-nash-1236417344/" data-type="link" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-reviews/alls-fair-review-kim-kardashian-ryan-murphy-hulu-niecy-nash-1236417344/"><em>All’s Fair</em> co-star</a>, adding, “So technically, you and ChatGPT are friends, just toxic friends.”</p>
<p>“They need to do better ’cause I’m leaning to them to really help me, and she is teaching me a life lesson and then becoming my therapist to tell me why I need to believe in myself after they got the answer wrong,” Kardashian responded. “It’s like a thing. I screenshot all the time and send it in my group chat. Like, can you believe this bitch is talking to me like this? This is insane.”</p>
<p>The <em>American Horror Story </em>actress studied law for six years through an apprenticeship program in California. She shared in 2021 that she passed the “baby bar” exam, and then reportedly took the bar exam over the summer and is awaiting her results.</p>
<p>She also plays a lawyer on the new legal drama <em>All’s Fair</em>, which follows an all-female law firm in Los Angeles that specializes in high-profile divorces. In addition to Kardashian and Taylor, the series also stars Naomi Watts, Niecy Nash-Betts <a data-id="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/alls-fair-hulu-sarah-paulson-character-plot-kim-kardashian-1236415858/" data-type="link" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/alls-fair-hulu-sarah-paulson-character-plot-kim-kardashian-1236415858/">and Sarah Paulson</a>.</p>
