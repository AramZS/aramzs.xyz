<p>Trump is the only senior Republican who hasn’t directly weighed in on a growing fracture among prominent conservatives over antisemitism that’s tearing apart their movement.</p>
<p>Since Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts defended Tucker Carlson’s friendly interview with white supremacist Nick Fuentes, the conservative think tank has faced <a href="https://nypost.com/2025/11/03/us-news/heritage-foundation-in-revolt-over-tucker-carlson-defense-after-controversial-nick-fuentes-interview-footsie-with-literal-nazis/">staff turmoil</a> and multiple resignations, <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/chris-demuth-resigns-from-the-heritage-foundation/">including by a former</a> American Enterprise Institute chief.</p>
<p>Both Senate Majority Leader John Thune and House Speaker Mike Johnson criticized Fuentes on Tuesday, with Johnson <a href="https://x.com/AudreyFahlberg/status/1985793521924649380">decrying</a> his rhetoric as “blatantly antisemitic, racist, and anti-American — anti-Christian, for that matter.”</p>
<p>Fuentes <a href="https://x.com/NickJFuentes/status/1985775962961961051">predicted</a> that his followers would prevail against the “same hysterical and out-of-touch ‘basket of deplorables’ condemnation from the Republican establishment” that originally greeted Trump (with whom Fuentes dined at Mar-a-Lago in 2022).</p>
<p>The White House didn’t return a request for comment on the intraparty blowback that Heritage and Carlson are experiencing.</p>
