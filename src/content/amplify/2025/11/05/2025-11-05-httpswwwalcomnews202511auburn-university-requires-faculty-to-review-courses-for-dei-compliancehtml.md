  Auburn University requires faculty to review courses to comply with anti-DEI
  law
---
<p>Auburn University faculty are being asked to assess their courses to ensure they’re not violating Alabama’s anti-DEI law weeks after a conservative blog pointed out classes that may violate law.</p>
<p>Days after compliance forms were sent, the provost’s office announced a web site detailing how to comply with state and federal DEI mandates and opened registration for faculty meetings to ask questions.</p>
<p>AL.com obtained a letter sent to college deans from Vini Nathan, provost and Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs.</p>
