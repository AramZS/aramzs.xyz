<p>Tinder is testing a new AI-powered feature that looks at the photos on your camera roll in an effort to find you better matches, according to an announcement from parent company Match Group. And while that might sounds like a rather invasive way to find a match, the dating app notes that it’s opt-in and will hopefully combat what it calls “swipe fatigue.”</p>
<p>The feature is called Chemistry and was announced by Match Group CEO Spencer Rascoff during an earnings call on Tuesday. The AI asks users interactive questions and seeks to find out what matters to a given user the most.</p>
<p>“Powered by AI, this interactive matching feature—a major part of Tinder’s upcoming 2026 product experience—gets to know users through fun, conversational prompts and, with permission, learns from their camera roll to better understand their interests and personality,” the company said in a prepared statement <a href="https://s203.q4cdn.com/993464185/files/doc_financials/2025/q3/MTCH-3Q-2025-Prepared-Remarks-vFinal.pdf">published online</a>.</p>
<p>Gizmodo hasn’t tested the feature yet, but the company is clearly stressing that it will only look through your camera roll if users give it permission to do just that. The Tinder app has gotten a refresh for Apple’s Liquid Glass on iOS and the company thinks that its new AI experiments will help improve the user experience.</p>
<p>“Using deep learning, Chemistry aims to reduce dating app fatigue by surfacing a few highly relevant profiles each day—driving more compatible matches and more engaging conversations,” a Tinder spokesperson told Gizmodo via email.</p>
<p>The AI feature is currently being tested in Australia and New Zealand. The company has plans to roll out the feature to additional countries “in the coming months,” but it’s not clear yet when that might include the U.S.</p>
<p>Aside from Chemistry, Tinder is also experimenting with other features, like a new Modes navigation, which was launched in September. Users can choose things like College Mode, which includes meeting new people with a friend in their college community or Double Date Mode, which lets you match with other pairs. Tinder reports that Double Date has been popular, particularly in Europe and with Gen Z more broadly.</p>
<p>The app is also reportedly being improved on the tech side of things, with Android startup times 38% faster and crash rates reduced by 32%, according to Match. The company also claims that app stability on iOS has improved considerably.</p>
