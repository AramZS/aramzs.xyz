  The results showed that Democrats don’t have to choose between attacking Trump
  and highlighting the economy. In fact, they are often inseparable.

title: Trump Humiliation Worsens as Fresh Info Reveals Scale of GOP Losses
---
<div><div><p>Zohran Mamdani’s stunning victory in the New York City mayoral race—in which he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/11/04/us/elections/results-new-york-city-mayor.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">broke 50 percent</a> against two serious opponents—also illustrates the point. Mamdani’s campaign was famously focused <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/198482/zohran-mamdani-success-rattle-national-democrats" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on affordability and costs</a>. But as <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/201158/trump-zohran-attack-backfired-economy" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">I’ve detailed</a>, he also went hard at Trump’s authoritarian abuses of power while running the most explicitly pro-immigrant and even pro-cosmopolitan campaign in memory, connecting the two with dramatic denunciations of ICE and confrontations over Trump’s lawless threats to deny federal funds deliberately to harm the city’s poor and working class.</p><p>Relative to the primary, Mamdani <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/05/nyregion/nyc-mayor-election-mamdani-takeaways.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">made big inroads</a> into working class black, Latino and immigrant communities. Yes, it’s hard to extrapolate national lessons from a New York race. But it’s clear that Mamdani’s twin attacks on economic and authoritarian power, his <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/201158/trump-zohran-attack-backfired-economy" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">fusion</a> of affordability, pro-immigrant, anti-Trump, and (yes) anti-fascist politics, have working-class appeal—particularly among the new, diverse, immigrant-heavy working class. Trump’s 2024 inroads into that demographic were accorded seismic significance, so national Democrats should find a lot to learn here as well.</p><p>As Ron Brownstein <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2025-11-05/election-results-nj-and-virginia-sent-a-warning-to-republicans?srnd=undefined&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">writes for Bloomberg</a>, this was also the story in California, where nonwhite working-class voters helped power victory on the Proposition 50 referendum allowing the state to redraw House maps. In all these races, Brownstein notes, Democrats started reversing their losses among Latinos as well; that plus these other gains suggest it was “premature” to see Trump’s inroads as a “durable realignment.”</p></div></div>
