<p>Or… why AdCP might finally end the middleman era of programmatic.</p>
<p>AdCP is an open-source protocol that lets advertisers and publishers negotiate, transact, and audit campaigns directly... yep! </p>
<p>No DSPs, no SSPs, no black boxes. </p>
<p>Just AI agents talking to each other, "transparently".</p>
<h3>Here’s How I See It</h3>
<p>I remember when “automation” in programmatic meant setting 47 line items to deliver 200% of budget overnight because someone fat-fingered a CPM.</p>
<p>Now we’re apparently replacing entire tech stacks with polite, conversational AI agents who say things like “Would you like to reach eco-conscious car buyers on CTV this week?”</p>
<p>Welcome to AdCP—the “Ad Context Protocol.” The industry’s first attempt at turning programmatic buying into a natural-language negotiation between AI agents. Think OpenRTB meets ChatGPT with receipts.</p>
<p>It’s built on Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol (MCP), the same foundation used to make AI models “talk” to each other. Except this time, the conversation is about CPMs, reach, and creative specs… not weather forecasts.</p>
<p>And yes, it’s open source. Which means the ad industry’s dirtiest secret—the one where everyone takes a hidden cut between buyer and seller—might finally have a paper trail.</p>
<h3>What’s Actually Changed</h3>
<ul> <li>Agentic ad buying is here. Instead of rigid auction bids, AI agents can interpret human-like instructions (“target new parents in Manchester on CTV and avoid gambling inventory”) and negotiate directly with publishers.</li> <li>Middlemen beware. No more layers of DSPs, SSPs, and mystery “optimisation fees.” Buyer and seller agents talk directly and log every transaction in real time.</li> <li>Everything’s auditable. Every decision, bid, and outcome is recorded in a transparent, machine-readable log. No more “trust us, it performed well.”</li> <li>Unified automation. Campaign discovery, activation, optimisation, and reporting all live in one place. No more Frankenstack of dashboards.</li> <li>Bias control built in. Data provenance and identity verification are native to the protocol, tackling brand safety, fraud, and bias before they hit your invoice.</li> </ul>
<h3>Why I Think You Should Care</h3>
<p>If you work in an agency, take a deep breath... this is the first real threat to your tech stack since programmatic began.</p>
<p>Because if AdCP works, everyone becomes their own DSP.</p>
<p>Agencies and advertisers could plan, activate, and optimise cross-platform campaigns through AI conversations instead of platform UIs. </p>
<p>Imagine saying “boost ROAS on Q4 CTV with sustainable brand placements” and watching your AI agent handle the rest—complete with transparent logs and real-time adjustments.</p>
<p>That’s not “automation.” That’s the deconstruction of programmatic’s rent-seeking economy.</p>
<p>DSPs and SSPs, who’ve built billion-dollar businesses on inefficiency, may suddenly find themselves… redundant.</p>
<p>And for brands? It’s the dream! Finally seeing where every pound actually goes, who took a cut, and how your AI decided it was worth it.</p>
<blockquote>For agencies, though, the question shifts from “Which DSP do we use?” to “How do we design, govern, and train our AI agents?”</blockquote>
<p>That’s a big leap. It turns AdOps into AIOps.</p>
<h3>Meanwhile in the Real World</h3>
<p>According to Videoweek, an entire industry coalition has already formed around AdCP—uniting SSPs, measurement firms, and data providers to make this real.</p>
<p>DMEXCO called it “the standard that lets AI run your media.” And they’re not joking.</p>
<p>The open documentation is live at <a data-test-link="" data-tracking-control-name="article-ssr-frontend-pulse_little-text-block" data-tracking-will-navigate="" href="https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=http%3A%2F%2Fadcontextprotocol%2Eorg&amp;urlhash=MwTK&amp;trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_little-text-block">adcontextprotocol.org</a>. And founding partners like MiQ, Aragil, and Anthropic are all in.</p>
<p>We’re talking about the beginning of a universal ad-language... an auditable, programmable structure for how campaigns are negotiated, run, and reported.</p>
<p>Think of it as OpenRTB 3.0… except this one actually tells you what happened.</p>
<blockquote>AdCP is the “Spotify moment” for programmatic.</blockquote>
<p>The middlemen got comfortable. The interface got smarter. Now, the buyers and sellers can talk directly... and they’ll wonder why they ever needed a playlist curator in the first place.</p>
