<p>Layoff announcements soared in October as companies recalibrated staffing levels during the artificial intelligence boom, a sign of potential trouble ahead for the labor market, according to outplacement firm Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas.</p>
<p>Job cuts for the month totaled 153,074, a 183% surge from September and 175% higher than the same month a year ago. It was the highest level for any October since 2003. This has been the worst year for announced layoffs since 2009.</p>
<p>“Like in 2003, a disruptive technology is changing the landscape,” said Andy Challenger, workplace expert and chief revenue officer at the firm. “At a time when job creation is at its lowest point in years, the optics of announcing layoffs in the fourth quarter are particularly unfavorable.”</p>
<p>The report provides a glimpse into the labor market at a time when the government <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/29/bls-wont-be-releasing-data-including-fridays-key-jobs-report-in-case-of-a-shutdown.html">has suspended data gathering and releases</a> during the shutdown in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>To be sure, the Challenger monthly numbers can be highly volatile, and an accelerated pace of layoffs has yet to show up in state-level weekly jobless claim filings that continue to come in despite the shutdown. Payrolls processing firm <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/05/private-payrolls-rose-42000-in-october-more-than-expected-and-countering-labor-market-fears-adp-says.html">ADP reported that October saw net job growth</a> of 42,000, reversing two consecutive months of losses in the private sector.</p>
<p>However, the report comes at a time when Federal Reserve officials have expressed concern about a softening labor market. The central bank has <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/29/fed-rate-decision-october-2025.html">lowered its benchmark interest rate twice</a> since September and is expected to approve another quarter percentage point reduction in December as policymakers look to get ahead of any more serious problems.</p>
<p>Challenger reports the highest level of layoffs coming from the technology sector amid a time of restructuring due to AI integration. Companies in the sector announced 33,281 cuts, nearly six times the level in September.</p>
<p>Consumer products also saw a sharp gain to 3,409, while nonprofits, an area hit hard by the shutdown, listed 27,651 cuts year to date, up 419% from the same point in 2024.</p>
<p>In total, companies have announced 1.1 million cuts this year, a 65% increase from a year ago and the highest level since the Covid pandemic year of 2020. October saw the highest total for any month in the fourth quarter since 2008.</p>
<p>“Some industries are correcting after the hiring boom of the pandemic, but this comes as AI adoption, softening consumer and corporate spending, and rising costs drive belt-tightening and hiring freezes. Those laid off now are finding it harder to quickly secure new roles, which could further loosen the labor market,” Challenger said.</p>
