<p>The number of voters casting ballots in the tense three-way race for mayor between Zohran Mamdani, Andrew Cuomo and Curtis Sliwa broke records, with more than 2 million check-ins, according to the city Board of Elections.</p>
<p>By comparison, 1.1 million ballots were cast in the entire 2021 election won by Eric Adams, and the last election to see such numbers was in 1969, when John Lindsay, running on a third-party line, won a second term against two rivals.</p>
<p>Polls closed at 9 p.m. The in-person votes and absentee ballots tallied so far account for 34% of the city’s roughly 5.3 million registered voters.</p>

<p>Mamdani secured more than 1 million votes, reflecting how his campaign helped spur a highly engaged electorate — one that the city has not seen in decades. And it’s changed the electorate from one that was once dominated by older, staunchly center Democrats to younger, <a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/2025/06/04/zohran-mamdani-volunteers-support-mayoral-race-progressive/">left-leaning voters</a>, many attracted by Mamdani’s grassroots campaign organization.</p>
<p>Backed by tens of millions of dollars in attack ads, including some painting Mamdani as a dangerous radical, rival Andrew Cuomo sought to rally a countermovement of voters, as did Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa.</p>
<p>The surge in turnout was largely propped by the 735,317 votes cast during nine days of <a href="https://x.com/BOENYC/status/1985127403690041390">early voting</a>, which ended Sunday. Though heavy rains last Thursday seemed to have impeded voters’ momentum, overall it did not stop certain groups of voters – such as Millennials or those who live in wealthier election districts – from turning out in large shares, according to an <a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/2025/11/02/early-voting-analysis-boomers-millennials-immigrants-generations/">analysis</a> by THE CITY.</p>
<p>The surge in votes is even more notable because the electorate has shrunk since New Yorkers last voted for a mayor: currently about 5.3 million registered voters reside in the city, down from 5.6 million four years ago.</p>
<p>Still, some 189,000 city residents registered to vote between February and November — with many of them joining the left-leaning Working Families Party, which ran Mamdani on its ballot line alongside his Democratic Party spot. Working Families Party registrations grew by at least 6% since February and by 28% since the last election. By contrast, the number of registered Democrats grew by 5%, but the party rolls have shrunk 7% since the last election.</p>
