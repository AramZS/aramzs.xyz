<p>Ruby Central, a non-profit organisation of the Ruby community, seized control of the GitHub repositories and some important gems of the RubyGems and Bundler package ecosystems without warning in mid-September. Long-time maintainers speak of a "hostile takeover" and some have resigned in protest.</p>
<p><a href="https://rubycentral.org/">Ruby Central</a> justifies its actions with the need to strengthen supply chain security in the Ruby ecosystem. Behind the scenes, however, funding issues and the influence of Shopify (a major Ruby sponsor) play a major role. The incident raises fundamental questions about the governance of open source projects: Who owns community code, and how much influence are funders allowed to have over open source infrastructure?</p>
<h3><strong>Ruby Central, RubyGems and Bundler – Who is who? </strong></h3>
<p>RubyGems (abbreviated to Gems) is the official package system for the Ruby programming language. Gems are published and installed via <a href="https://rubygems.org/">the central directory RubyGems.org</a>. Bundler, in turn, is a dependency management tool integrated into Ruby that ensures that all required gems are available in the correct versions in a project. RubyGems.org has always been run by Ruby Central, a non-profit organization that hosts the annual Ruby conferences (e.g. RubyConf and RailsConf) and takes care of important community infrastructure.</p>
<p>In the past, Ruby Central also funded developers working on RubyGems and Bundler, but did not formally have ownership of their source code. Rather, RubyGems and Bundler were maintained and further developed as open source projects by community maintainers over the years.</p>
<p>David Heinemeier Hansson (DHH) is a prominent figure in this context: as the creator of the web framework Ruby on Rails and co-founder of the company Basecamp, he enjoys cult status on the one hand, but on the other he is increasingly <a href="https://www.heise.de/news/Rails-Entwicklerinnen-und-Entwickler-forken-sich-von-Heinemeier-Hansson-weg-10671418.html?from-en=1">causing controversy with his controversial political statements</a>. In the Ruby community, there has recently been outrage over blog posts by Hansson in which he complained, for example, that London is "no longer full of native Brits" and showed sympathy for right-wing activist Tommy Robinson. Community members described such statements as "toxic" and called <a href="https://github.com/Plan-Vert/open-letter">for a new leadership structure for Rails or a fork</a>. Hansson's polarizing demeanor has led to his participation in community events – like the last RailsConf in Philadelphia – is controversially discussed.</p>
<p>Shopify, a Canadian e-commerce giant, is one of the biggest users of Ruby on Rails. The company employs numerous Rails developers and invests heavily in the Ruby ecosystem. Shopify CEO Tobias Lütke is also a supporter of DHH (Hansson even sits on Shopify's board of directors). In recent years, Shopify has been one of the main sponsors of Ruby Central and therefore has considerable influence – both financially and in terms of personnel (some Ruby Central board members are Shopify employees).</p>
<h3><strong>Funding crisis: DHH controversy leads to loss of sponsors </strong></h3>
<p>The roots of the current crisis lie partly in a funding shortfall. Ruby Central lost an important sponsor (USD 250,000 per year) in Sidekiq (a background job framework widely used in the Ruby world) at the beginning of 2025 after DHH was invited to speak at RailsConf 2025 (incidentally, it was the final RailsConf). Mike Perham from Sidekiq was annoyed that Ruby Central gave Hansson a stage despite his controversial views. This cancellation tore a big hole in the budget – Ruby Central was therefore practically financially dependent on Shopify.</p>
<p>Shopify, in turn, is said to have used the opportunity to impose conditions. According to individual, but unsubstantiated, reports from the community, Shopify formulated an ultimatum: Ruby Central was to gain complete control of RubyGems by a certain deadline – both via the code repositories on GitHub and via essential gems (namely the rubygems and bundler projects as well as the bundler and rubygems-update gems) – otherwise Shopify would discontinue its support. This demand was justified about supply chain security, but at the same time was clearly linked to continued financial support – <a href="https://dev.to/cseeman/what-just-happened-to-rubygems-31n9">a "clearly outlined ultimatum deal"</a>.</p>
<p>It is important to realise that such a demand from Shopify could be well-intentioned. There are not many companies that are as dependent on a functioning Ruby ecosystem as Shopify. But well-intentioned is not always well done.</p>
<p>Ruby Central came under massive pressure as a result. Internally, it was apparently clear that if Shopify's demands were ignored, the existence of the organisation would be at stake. Freedom Dumlao, a member of the Ruby Central board, later put it in a nutshell: if he had voted against the takeover, he would have effectively<a href="https://joel.drapper.me/p/rubygems-takeover/"> "started the process of shutting down Ruby Central"</a>. The majority of the board therefore decided – despite all reservations – in favour of following Shopify's conditions so as not to jeopardise the financial future and operation of RubyGems.org.</p>
<h3><strong>Takeover process: from zero communication to a complete reset</strong></h3>
<p>In the second week of September 2025, Ruby Central officials abruptly put the plan into action. Without prior notice or consultation with the previous maintainer teams, they made drastic changes within just a few days:</p>
<ul><li>9 September 2025: a RubyGems maintainer (Hiroshi SHIBATA, GitHub alias HSBT) arbitrarily renamed the GitHub organisation "RubyGems" to "Ruby Central", added Ruby Central director Marty Haught as the new owner and revoked the admin rights of all other maintainers. When perplexed community members lodged a protest, HSBT initially refused to reverse these changes – He claimed that he needed Marty's permission first.</li><li>September 15, 2025: After several days of unrest, <a href="https://pup-e.com/goodbye-rubygems.pdf">Marty Haught</a> told the RubyGems team that the previous permission changes were a "mistake" and "should never have happened". HSBT then restored some old permissions. However, Marty himself remained registered as the owner of the GitHub orga – although the maintainer team had never granted it this right. The community maintainers took advantage of the breathing space and immediately began drafting a formal governance guideline for RubyGems to avoid future disputes over competences. (This was modelled on the package manager Homebrew, which had already established such structures.)</li><li>18 September 2025: Without further explanation, Marty Haught took the step of removing all remaining admin members of the GitHub organisation in the RubyGems, Bundler and RubyGems.org teams. Virtually overnight, all long-time maintainers lost access to their projects. On the same day, Ruby Central also deactivated the authorisations of these people on the RubyGems hosting platform itself – Specifically, the bundler and rubygems-update gems on RubyGems.org were placed under the control of Ruby Central. With this move, the previous maintainers were completely disempowered and the RubyGems ecosystem was now in the hands of Ruby Central (or their staff).</li></ul>
<p>Ellen Dash, a RubyGems maintainer for over ten years, commented bluntly: "This was a hostile takeover". The "forcible removal of those who had nurtured RubyGems and Bundler for over a decade" could not be described in any other way. Dash resigned from her role at Ruby Central shortly afterward. She had made the events, beginning on September 9th, public <a href="https://pup-e.com/goodbye-rubygems.pdf">in a detailed PDF report</a> titled "Ruby Central's Attack on RubyGems".</p>
<p>Other maintainers and community members also reacted with shock. The sudden takeover had happened without any warning or community consultation. Several of those removed emphasized that Ruby Central had taken over projects that did not even belong to the organization –. The code of RubyGems, Bundler and the RubyGems.org web application is the common property of the community, not the property of Ruby Central.</p>
<p>Even people close to Ruby Central admitted that Marty Haught and the board knew that they had no right to these repositories. In a meeting on 17 September, Marty is even <a href="https://joel.drapper.me/p/rubygems-takeover/">said to</a> have suggested a fork of the codebases in question as an alternative and warned of the foreseeable consequences of a forced takeover. Nevertheless, the decision was made in favour of a crackdown.</p>
<h3><strong>Reactions from the community: resignations, criticism and a new project </strong></h3>
<p>The removal of the previous maintainers led to considerable resentment in the Ruby community. In addition to Ellen Dash, other people involved also gave up their collaboration with Ruby Central. André Arko – known as a longtime Bundler maintainer and founder of the Ruby Together initiative – was one of those affected who was not allowed to return on Shopify's instructions. <a href="https://gist.github.com/simi/349d881d16d3d86947945615a47c60ca">He described Ruby Central's approach</a> as "dictatorial" and a betrayal of the principles of open source collaboration. Arko and others made it clear that RubyGems (as open source code) and the RubyGems.org service are two separate things – The latter is operated by Ruby Central, but the code was developed free of charge by volunteers for years. "Just because Ruby Central has paid people to work on the service doesn't mean it suddenly owns the open source code – is not how open source works," <a href="https://dev.to/cseeman/what-just-happened-to-rubygems-31n9">one community post noted</a>. However, <a href="https://justin.searls.co/posts/why-im-not-rushing-to-take-sides-in-the-rubygems-fiasco/">there are reports that Arko</a> has also worked very opaquely in the past and used financial resources on its own authority.</p>
<p>Frustration spread among the maintainers, especially as they themselves were working on improvements to governance, which were abruptly interrupted by the incident. Shortly before the takeover, Martin Emde had submitted an RFC draft for a formal RubyGems governance model; after its removal, <a href="https://github.com/rubygems/rfcs/pull/61#issuecomment-3314607127">he sarcastically commented</a> that he would "adopt many of the proposed changes immediately" – if I still had write access to the repository".</p>
<p>Mike McQuaid, head of the Homebrew project, tried to mediate between Ruby Central and the maintainer teams, but to no avail. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mikemcquaid.com/post/3lz7klsyue22f">McQuaid publicly criticised</a> Ruby Central for "extraordinarily mismanaging" the situation and even "accidentally removing the most active member of the RubyGems org". The reference to nebulous supply chain security concerns was "unnecessary FUD".</p>
<p>An important point of criticism: the action suddenly left crucial parts of the Ruby infrastructure virtually without experienced support. RubyGems.org lost the majority of its volunteer operators and maintainers in one fell swoop. The incident response team was filled ad hoc with Shopify engineers and other volunteers. Although these were competent developers, they had little experience with the actual operation of RubyGems.org, <a href="https://joel.drapper.me/p/rubygems-takeover/">according to Joel Drapper</a> – the developer who uncovered the events. There could be no question of "business as usual". The further development of the tools is also effectively on hold for now as long as the original maintainers are locked out.</p>
<p>Concerns have also been raised in the community that Ruby Central may not ever intend to share control again. Drapper wrote in a fact check blog post that Ruby Central never intended to return Bundler and RubyGems to their maintainers. All but two of the original maintainers (HSBT and Colby Swandale, the latter a Ruby Central employee) had been removed, and two new "owners" had been appointed to GitHub in their place: Marty Haught as well as Ufuk Kayserilioglu, a Shopify manager and also Ruby Central board member.</p>
<p>André Arko and security engineer Samuel Giddins in particular were deliberately declared persona non grata. Drapper and others argue that Ruby Central could have achieved its goals (operational security) without this hostile takeover –, for example by creating their own fork of the RubyGems code or stricter controls during deployment without taking over the community repositories.</p>
<p>Another aspect fuelling the situation: shortly before the events, some maintainers (including Arko and Giddins) had founded a new open source project called "Spinel" – a cooperative that is working <a href="https://andre.arko.net/2025/08/25/rv-a-new-kind-of-ruby-management-tool/">on an alternative Ruby tool called rv</a>. This is intended to combine and modernize various existing tools (Ruby Version Manager, Bundler, RubyGems) in the long term. From the perspective of some people close to Ruby Central, this represented a conflict of interest: <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/rmfranca.bsky.social/post/3lz7alpobhc2x">Rails Core developer Rafael França</a> (employee at Shopify), for example, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/rmfranca.bsky.social/post/3lz7alpobhc2x">expressed</a> distrust of the maintainer plans – they had "publicly announced a competing tool" and he was "not sure I trust them not to sabotage RubyGems". Critics suspect that such fears for Shopify/Ruby Central have favoured the hard line. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/rmfranca.bsky.social/post/3lz7alpobhc2x">The maintainers concerned, on the other hand, emphasise</a> that rv is intended as a constructive community contribution and not a "sabotage" project. Nevertheless, this incident shows how shattered the relationship of trust between the Ruby Central board and parts of the community has become.</p>
<h3><strong>Ruby Central's position: security and formalised structures</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://rubycentral.org/news/strengthening-the-stewardship-of-rubygems-and-bundler/">Ruby Central published</a> an official statement entitled "Strengthening the Stewardship of RubyGems and Bundler" shortly after the takeover became public knowledge. In the statement and in an accompanying video address, CEO Shan Cureton emphasises Ruby Central's responsibility as the guardian of critical infrastructure. Due to increasing supply chain attacks in the software world, it was decided, in consultation with lawyers and following a security audit, to tighten the governance of the projects, restrict access rights and introduce formal operator and maintainer agreements.</p>
<p>For the time being, administrative access to RubyGems.org, RubyGems and Bundler will only be granted to paid Ruby Central employees until new guidelines for commit rights have been drawn up. This decision was made by the Board of Directors and is part of its fiduciary duty to ensure the security and stability of the ecosystem.</p>
<p>According to Ruby Central, the measures are temporary. It is working on a long-term solution that ensures transparent, community-centred governance. A model is proposed with a public core team, a committer team and a triage team to involve the community. Ruby Central wants to play a supporting role and continue to provide funding for further development. Cureton assured: "This is not a compartmentalisation of community contributions and is not permanent". Rather, the aim is to calmly conclude formal agreements with all parties involved in order to then continue the collaboration in an orderly manner.</p>
<p>She cited the fact that important sponsors and companies that rely on Ruby had expressed urgent security concerns to Ruby Central as the reason for the haste. It had not been possible to reach an agreement with the previous maintainer teams within a tight deadline. The board therefore had to act "with a heavy heart" in order not to jeopardise the continued existence of RubyGems.org.</p>
<p>However, many in the community consider these explanations to be euphemistic and inadequate. The official announcement appears anonymous and in typical PR style – No one from the Ruby Central team signs them personally. As expected, David Heinemeier Hansson defended the move: <a href="https://x.com/dhh/status/1969051000867610709">he praised</a> Ruby Central <a href="https://x.com/dhh/status/1969051000867610709">on X</a> for making the Ruby supply chain "technically and organizationally unassailable" and said that Ruby Central was effectively the maintainer, as the organization was paying the developers. However, these statements seem ironic, as Hansson <a href="https://x.com/dhh/status/1845197490829889605">had heavily criticized</a> the takeover of an open source project in a different context a year ago: In the case of a stolen WordPress plug-in, he wrote that it was "as if the operators of rubygems.org simply decided to expropriate the official Rails Gems and lock out the core team" – a "dangerous new territory for open source". Exactly such a scenario is now playing out in DHH's own ecosystem with its approval.</p>
<p>A board member of Ruby Central, Ufuk Kayserilioglu (Shopify), <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ufuk.dev/post/3lz757f6zlc2s">tried to calm things down on BlueSky</a> by arguing that Ruby Central has been operating RubyGems.org "for years", so it is "hardly possible to speak of a supply chain attack" – On the contrary, there is a legal obligation to keep the system secure. Critics counter that no one has accused Ruby Central of attacking itself –. The takeover of the community code base, which would not have been necessary for operational security, was under discussion.</p>
<p>Kayserilioglu also asked rhetorically: "Why should restricting access to critical infra and code be a supply chain attack?", once again demonstrating that Ruby Central (consciously or unconsciously) lumps code repository and service infrastructure together. Joel Drapper's fact check considers this equation to be clearly misleading: there is the RubyGems.org service – the online service at rubygems.org, operated by Ruby Central – on the one hand and the open source code of the RubyGems.org project (repository on GitHub) on the other. The former is of course a productive infrastructure, but is not identical to the source code, which is freely available and can be operated by anyone on their own servers. Although Ruby Central has a duty to operate the service securely, it would not have been necessary to "take over" the open source projects. For example, a private (soft) fork of the RubyGems code could have been created and verified commits could have been imported there, or a publicly traceable hard fork could have been started under Ruby Central's direction without hijacking the existing repos. According to Drapper, these alternatives were rejected by the Ruby Central board.</p>
<p>Ruby Central, however, insists that it has the good of the community in mind. <a href="https://rubycentral.org/news/strengthening-the-stewardship-of-rubygems-and-bundler/">In their statement, they pay</a> tribute to the "many generations of maintainers over the last two decades" and promise to continue their legacy in an open and collaborative spirit. The Ruby community has always been built on collaboration, accountability and care, and that's what these changes are all about – the infrastructure should remain healthy, safe and resilient. Despite these conciliatory words, the relationship of trust remains severely damaged.</p>
<h3><strong>Bundler belongs to the community – Trademark as a trump card</strong></h3>
<p>André Arko made an interesting move to protect the community's interests at Bundler: He registered or reaffirmed the trademark (trade mark right) to the Bundler name in his own name. <a href="https://andre.arko.net/2025/09/25/bundler-belongs-to-the-ruby-community/">In a blog post</a> entitled "Bundler belongs to the Ruby community", Arko explains his motives: he and dozens of volunteers have built Bundler over fifteen years; Ruby Central, on the other hand, recently "suddenly claimed that only they own Bundler" – which is not true.</p>
<p>The registration of the trademark is intended to prevent Ruby Central or a sponsor from unilaterally appropriating the project. Arko emphasizes that this is not about code or license – Bundler remains open source under the MIT licence, and anyone can use the code freely. However, trademark law regulates who may use the name Bundler for a product. Ruby Central can fork and change the code as much as they want – "They're just not allowed to call the result Bundler" if it's no longer the real community version.</p>
<p>Arko makes it clear that he does not want to keep the brand personally in the long term: as soon as there is a new Ruby organization that is accountable to maintainers and the community (for example with an openly elected board), he will transfer the brand to this organization. He rejects licensing to Ruby Central for the time being – The only option is a complete transfer to a truly community-controlled entity. "Bundler should belong to the community, and I want to make sure it stays that way for all time," says Arko.</p>
<p>The action underlines the fact that Bundler – as well as RubyGems – is a community project according to its long-standing maintainers. In fact, the funding and coordination of these tools used to be in the hands of Ruby Together, an organisation co-founded by Arko, which was set up in 2015 to raise money for Bundler/RubyGems maintainers. Ruby Together merged with Ruby Central in 2021, explicitly stating that Ruby Central would henceforth take over the promotion of maintainers and continue Ruby Together's "vision, mission and values". These values <a href="https://andre.arko.net/2025/09/25/bundler-belongs-to-the-ruby-community/">clearly state</a>: "Project users and maintainers are empowered to decide what's best for their projects" and "Give control to the community" – The control should therefore lie with the community – as well as transparency and accountability to the community. Many developers see Ruby Central's current approach as a blatant breach of precisely these principles.</p>
<h3><strong>Outlook: Trial by fire for the Ruby community </strong></h3>
<p>What happens now? The situation is currently (as of the end of September 2025) unclear. Ruby Central has announced that it wants to reintegrate the disempowered maintainers – but probably only under the newly established conditions (contract signing, formal distribution of roles, etc.). Some former maintainers have often signaled that they will not return under these circumstances. André Arko and Samuel Giddins in particular, who have also lost their Ruby Central membership following these events, remain on the sidelines. Others – partly by Shopify – Developers have stepped forward to fill the gaps.</p>
<p>The Ruby community is potentially facing a split as a result. If Ruby Central insists on full control, important projects could emerge outside the organization in the future. Arko's new collective Spinel and its tool rv are a first indication that the community is looking for more decentralized alternatives. Some community members even see the current scandal as an opportunity to put the Ruby infrastructure on a broader footing – in line with the decentralised package approach of the Go community. There are also calls to generally achieve more independence from individual companies (be it Shopify or others) so that open source projects do not become the plaything of corporate interests. But this is of course – for amounts of money in the amount of 250,000 US dollars – easier said than done.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Ruby Central has emphasised that it by no means wants to exclude the community, but on the contrary wants to put the projects on a more sustainable footing. If it is possible to win back some of the trust – for example through genuine co-determination of the community in the announced new structures –, the dust could settle in the long term. However, Ruby Central would have to establish transparency, treat the original maintainers with respect and show that it is really about security and stability and not about power. A constructive gesture could be, for example, to involve an independent ombudsperson or mediator (as Mike McQuaid wanted to offer) and to take up the community's governance proposals seriously.</p>
<p>In the short term, however, the situation remains tense. Forums <a href="https://mastodon.social/@mikemcquaid/115246936877304291">and social media</a> are talking about the "darkest day for the Ruby ecosystem". What was intended as an internal administrative act to safeguard the infrastructure has turned into a fundamental debate about community governance, corporate influence and breach of trust in open source projects. The coming weeks and months will show whether Ruby Central and the maintainers can work together to find a way out of the crisis – or whether RubyGems and Bundler will be further developed in different camps in the future. The Ruby community, which has always been known for its motto "MINASWAN" (Matz is nice and so we are nice – regarding the polite tone of Ruby inventor Yukihiro Matz Matsumoto) is experiencing turbulent times.</p>
