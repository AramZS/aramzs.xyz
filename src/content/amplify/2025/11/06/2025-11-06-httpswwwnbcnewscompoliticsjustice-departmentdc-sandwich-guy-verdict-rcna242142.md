  Jury acquits D.C. 'sandwich guy' charged with chucking a sub at a federal
  agent
---
<p>WASHINGTON — Jurors showed no appetite for the Justice Department's case against "sandwich guy," the D.C. resident who chucked a Subway sandwich at the chest of a federal officer, finding him not guilty on Thursday after several hours of deliberations.</p>
<p>The jury — which feasted on sandwiches for lunch on Thursday, according to a person familiar with jury lunches — deliberated the charges for several hours on Wednesday and Thursday before delivering the verdict.</p>
<p>Sean Dunn, a former Justice Department paralegal, faced a single misdemeanor count after a federal grand jury <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/grand-jury-declines-indict-sandwich-guy-threw-sub-dc-federal-officer-rcna227464">rejected more serious charges</a> over the incident, which took place in the nightlife area of U Street in August.</p>
<p>Border Patrol Officer Greg Lairmore received two "gag gifts" related to the incident — a plush sandwich and a patch featuring a cartoon of Dunn throwing the sandwich with the words “Felony Footlong” — which the defense team argued showed this was not a serious event in his life.</p>
<p>Lairmore had testified that the sandwich “exploded all over” his chest and claimed he could smell mustard and onions. But a photo showed that the sandwich was still in its wrapper on the ground after it hit Lairmore in his bulletproof vest.</p>
<p>Images of Dunn became a symbol of resistance to the Trump administration in Washington, with murals popping up on walls depicting a man throwing a sandwich, and with people placing sandwiches in the hands of giant skeletons for Halloween.</p>

<p>Grand jurors in Washington have rejected several cases against defendants that were brought by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia, which under the Trump administration has been run by two Trump loyalists: first Ed Martin and now Jeanine Pirro.</p>
<p>In closing arguments, defense attorney Sabrina Shroff argued that a sandwich could not and did not cause harm.</p>
<p>“This case, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, is about a sandwich,” she said.</p>
