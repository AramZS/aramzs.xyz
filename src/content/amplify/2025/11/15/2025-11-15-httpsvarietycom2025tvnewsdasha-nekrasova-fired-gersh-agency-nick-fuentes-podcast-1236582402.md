<p>“Succession” actress <a data-tag="dasha-nekrasova" href="https://variety.com/t/dasha-nekrasova/">Dasha Nekrasova</a> has been fired by her talent agency, <a data-tag="gersh" href="https://variety.com/t/gersh/">Gersh</a>, a spokesperson has confirmed to <em>Variety. </em>The actress was let go after far-right commentator <a data-tag="nick-fuentes" href="https://variety.com/t/nick-fuentes/">Nick Fuentes</a> appeared on Nekrasova’s podcast “Red Scare,” which she hosts with Anna Khachiyan.</p>
<p>On the podcast video, uploaded to YouTube on Oct. 10, the hosts discussed Fuentes’ rise in popularity, as well as the Charlie Kirk assassination, immigration, Kanye West, vaccines, the “Groyper army” and more. The video has received 220,000 views, while a repost has received an additional 69,000 views.</p>
<p>Fuentes has been criticized, including by some on the right, for being a leader in the so-called “Groyper” movement, a racist and antisemitic belief system. A recent New York Times story described the 27-year-old as a white nationalist, and noted that right-wing host Tucker Carlson’s recent interview with Fuentes triggered rounds of acrimony and recriminations on the American right.” During the Carlson interview, the Times noted that Fuentes “called for an exclusive, ‘pro-white,’ Christian movement and said that ‘organized Jewry’ undermines American cohesion.”</p>
<p>On “Succession,” Nekrasova played Comfrey Pellits, a member of Kendall Roy’s PR team (and briefly the girlfriend to cousin Greg) in nine episodes. Her other TV credits include “The Serpent,” “Dickinson” and “Mr. Robot.” Her film credits include “Materialists” and “The Scary of Sixty-First,” which she also wrote and directed.</p>
<p>Nekrasova has made controversial statements in the past. In a 2023 New Yorker story, she was quoted as saying, “Francis is not the real Pope, we all know it. … You’re not gonna get rid of the Freemasons. You’re not gonna get rid of the Jews. They infiltrated the Church a long time ago.”</p>
