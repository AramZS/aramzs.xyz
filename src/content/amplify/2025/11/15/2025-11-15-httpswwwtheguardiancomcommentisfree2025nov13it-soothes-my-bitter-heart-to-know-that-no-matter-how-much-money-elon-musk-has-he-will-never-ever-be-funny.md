<h2 data-gu-name="standfirst">What the Tesla tycoon wants his billions can’t buy: being able to get a true laugh</h2>
<p>As I’ve written before, the world is being <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jan/16/i-knew-one-day-id-have-to-watch-powerful-men-burn-the-world-down-i-just-didnt-expect-them-to-be-such-losers">burnt down around us by some of the biggest losers in history</a>. It is painful to watch. In difficult times like these, it is important to try to find silver linings.</p>
<p>For me, the brightest of these linings shines from Elon Musk, who is one of the worst contributors to today’s “world vibe”. He has <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/picture/2025/nov/12/what-do-you-need-to-do-to-earn-a-trillion-dollars-in-this-economy-elon-musk">an unbelievable amount of money</a>, and therefore power. He has the president’s bandaged ear. He bought Twitter, made it horrible, and now spends a concerning amount of time on there, like a guy who brought alcohol for the party so you have to let him hang out.</p>
<p>It’s annoying for such a derpy dweeb (scientific name) to have this much power but there is one thing that soothes my bitter heart. It’s that I know for a fact that Musk will never feel truly satisfied. Because no matter how much money he has, how many people he buys to do what he wants, how many bootlickers he keeps around – he will never, ever be funny.</p>
<p>What Musk really wants his billions can’t buy: being able to get a true laugh. Here is a clip I saw of him trying to tell a joke on Joe Rogan’s show.</p>

<p>Watching it gave me the same feeling as watching a visceral horror film, or a cringe comedy that makes you want to depart from your own skin. If you can’t watch the clip (and I wouldn’t blame you), the setup is about two economists. One pays the other $100 to eat a pile of shit, then the other one pays the first one $100 to eat another pile of shit.</p>
<blockquote data-spacefinder-role="inline"> <p><figure><svg class="dcr-scql1j" style="fill:var(--block-quote-fill)" viewbox="0 0 22 14"><path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"></path></svg></figure>Then they said, look, wait a second. We both just ate a pile of shit and we don’t have any more extra money. We both just gave the $100 back to me and we both ate a pile of shit. This doesn’t make any sense. And they said, no, no, but think of the economy, because that’s $200 in the economy, basically, eating shit would count as a job.</p> </blockquote>
<p>I am generally against comparing a joke spoken out loud with a joke written down, because so much is in the delivery. In this case, it’s doing him a favour. Those words come from the mouth of a man who can’t even say the word “shit” – coughing and stumbling over it like a child who knows it’s naughty – on his way to ruining the punchline because he can’t remember it. Whoever came up with this joke (because you know it was not Musk) should sue for butchery. He chuckles the entire time, to mostly complete silence, until at some point Rogan forces out a laugh, like a custom-made sycophant doll who pushes out air if you squeeze him hard enough.</p>
<p>This is emblematic of Musk’s comedic stylings. He wants to be charming and engaging but he is simply incapable of it. Even when he stands next to Donald Trump he comes off as a black hole of charm.</p>
<p>The people who willingly listen to Musk telling a story all have ulterior motives. If you took away his money, we all know (including Musk himself) that most people would run from him so fast they’d leave human-shaped holes in the walls.</p>
<p>Musk isn’t self-aware enough to become funny, he isn’t self-aware enough to put his ego away and figure out how to endear himself to us – but he is self-aware enough to know that nobody is genuinely laughing at his jokes.</p>
<p>There are many different ways to be funny and fun to be around. Musk has dodged every one. It’s not just that he is one of the worst joke deliverers to have ever existed – maybe he’ll find someone worse in space! It’s not awkwardness; some of the funniest and most charming people I know are awkward. <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/nathan-fielder">Nathan Fielder</a> is one of our best comedians.</p>
<p>Musk is not (just) awkward – he seems empty. Being funny generally requires being engaged in the world. It requires thinking about others, what they will relate to. It requires having empathy, being open and expanding your point of view. <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/joyce-carol-oates">Joyce Carol Oates</a> just eviscerated him on this score on X.</p>

<p>So curious that such a wealthy man never posts anything that indicates that he enjoys or is even aware of what virtually everyone appreciates— scenes from nature, pet dog or cat, praise for a movie, music, a book (but doubt that he reads); pride in a friend’s or relative’s accomplishment; condolences for someone who has died; pleasure in sports, acclaim for a favorite team;  references to history.  In fact he seems totally uneducated , uncultured. The poorest persons on Twitter may have access to more beauty &amp; meaning in life than the “most wealthy person in the world.”</p>

<p>He reacted predictably, calling Oates mean and wrong, and then going to comment “great movie” on several tweets about films. He felt insecure about what she said because he knows it’s true. He has no curiosity about the world outside himself – yet he is still desperate for validation.</p>
