<p>The military service, which falls under the Department of Homeland Security, has drafted a new policy that classifies such items “potentially divisive.”</p>
<p>The U.S. Coast Guard will no longer classify the swastika, an emblem of fascism and white supremacy inextricably linked to the murder of millions of Jews and that more than 400,000 U.S. troops died fighting against in World War II, as a hate symbol, according to a new policy that takes effect next month.</p>
