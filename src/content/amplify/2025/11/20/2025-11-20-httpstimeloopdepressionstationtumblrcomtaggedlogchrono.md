(it’s just me talking aloud about dungeon layouts/balance) <br/></p><p>currently doing a lot of things at once (story! dungeon layout! pixel art! battle balance!) with dungeon layout being the most annoying</p><p>cant decide yet if i want a persona ¾ type layout (random floors with no real reason as to why they are that way- just a grinding session with dialogue every few floors) or a more rpg maker like dungeon (actual rooms, “find a key to move on by solving these puzzles”). first one is easy enough to make while second would take more time/brain power.<br/></p><figure data-orig-height="911" data-orig-width="1255"><img alt="image" data-orig-height="911" data-orig-width="1255" height="363" src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/6799a80d20849b872c532b6fc969c57e/55d900356d5e308b-82/s500x750/c41f734f0c6092d0cfa20746d9ee373c3f78e2ce.png" width="500"/></figure><p>(also i found the “generate dungeon” command)</p><p>BUT MOSTLY: i wanna add a bunch of moments for the characters to chat, and second one would def work better as they’d actually have environment things to talk about. having the same kind of problem with battles- how to make them interesting even though the core gameplay is to have a bunch of repeating battles/dungeons? might fuck around and end up creating my own gameplay that mixes heavy story while still making the gameplay interesting? was thinking about maybe not even having battles at all and its just the characters chatting while in battle. but then thats just a visual novel. i guess i just want the strengths of a visual novel (focus on dialogue/story) while still having the gameplay beats of an rpg (levels, battles, etc). <br/></p><p>i may just be stuck because ive been seeing a lot of posts on rpg maker’s forums like “an rpg has to be like THIS” but i may just say fuck it and make an rpg thats 50% dialogue 50% actual gameplay. for me. also one post was like “turn based battles are the best, dont add any of that time attack stuff” like what the heck??? turn based battles are boring???? im gonna add time attack stuff like in undertale/mother 3/paper mario. i do what i want. my gaem<br/></p><figure data-orig-height="735" data-orig-width="1161"><img alt="image" data-orig-height="735" data-orig-width="1161" height="317" src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/a290cdb4da8c9dbcac43ded942adef35/55d900356d5e308b-00/s500x750/35f09210f4e7e719991abb48af348b5188db5cd0.png" width="500"/></figure><p>anyway like i said im working on skills. it’s kinda fun bc it’s easy to add characterization thru skills (what kinda skills would this character have? how strong are they? how would they execute it?), but balancing them is whats taking the most time. thankfully the game wont have a lot of enemies and only one of them matters (the final boss) so im just balancing against the final boss rn and we’ll see how that goes. ive been analyzing Nyx from persona 3 and the informer from End Roll for like, difficult and time consuming turn based bosses, aka “god i just spent 30mn against this boss i hate this shit”. and also since the game/demo take place during the “endgame” all characters will have 6+ skills so im gonna have to work so that they’re not confusing enough to figure out. <br/></p><p>also while balancing im realizing that something i like with skills is stuff like, high risk high reward? so i might add a bunch of those types of skills because its funny. what if you can one shot the final boss because your 3% ohko skill decided to work that day. thats the good stuff</p><p>also i still need to find a name for all those lil guys. especially the main one i cant just call them “fella” the whole time. been thinking about sif maybe, but add two Fs and an E to make it more french. Siffe. or siska because it means cone but thats not french. or siffrein because it’s a hell name for english speakers to pronounce. siffrein, sif for short. we’ll see<br/></p><figure data-orig-height="1536" data-orig-width="2672"><img alt="image" data-orig-height="1536" data-orig-width="2672" height="287" src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/c059046208cd4ee083c3e7e7352339ef/55d900356d5e308b-0d/s500x750/79b9eb075183d18d4f37b084bbb3c805b5abbaf8.png" width="500"/></figure></div>
