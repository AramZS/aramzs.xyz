<p>What do people ask the popular chatbot? We analyzed thousands of chats to identify common topics discussed by users and patterns in ChatGPT’s responses.</p>
<p>The questions flood in from every corner of the human psyche. “What are permanent hair removal solutions?” “Can you help me analyze this text conversation between me and my boyfriend?” “Tell me all about woke mind virus.” “What is the survivors rate for paracetamol overdose?” “Are you feeling conscious?”</p>
<p>ChatGPT answers them all, flitting from grooming advice to relationship help to philosophy.</p>
