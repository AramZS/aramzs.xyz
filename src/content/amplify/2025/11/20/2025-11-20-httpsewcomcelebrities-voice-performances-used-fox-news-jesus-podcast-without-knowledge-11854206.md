  Kristen Bell, Malcolm McDowell, and more stars had 'no knowledge' that their
  voices would be used in a Fox News podcast about Jesus until this week, as

<p>Fox News unveiled a star-studded lineup for a podcast about Jesus — but the actors in the cast say they had no idea the project existed, let alone that they would appear in the show.</p>
<p>The network <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" href="https://press.foxnews.com/2025/11/fox-news-audio-inks-new-licensing-deal-to-air-the-life-of-jesus-podcast-beginning-november-30">announced Wednesday</a> that it would premiere a 52-episode podcast series from Gulfstream Studios titled <em>The Life of Jesus</em> at the end of the month as part of its Fox Faith vertical. Each 30-minute episode will feature an introduction from <em>Fox &amp; Friends</em> host Ainsley Earhardt, and a multitude of Hollywood stars are providing voices for biblical figures throughout the series.</p>

<p>Among the casting announcements: <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://ew.com/person/kristen-bell/">Kristen Bell</a> as Mary Magdalene, <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://ew.com/person/malcolm-mcdowell/">Malcolm McDowell</a> as Caiaphas, Neal McDonough as Jesus, John Rhys-Davies as the narrator, Brian Cox as God, Julia Ormond as Mother Mary, Sean Astin as Matthew, Michael York as Luke, Stacy Keach as John, and Hill Harper as an angel.</p>
<p>Representatives for multiple actors from the project, however, tell <em>Entertainment Weekly</em> that they never signed on for the podcast, and that they were unaware of its existence until this week.</p>

<p>A representative for McDowell says that the <em>Clockwork Orange</em> star lent his voice to a different biblical project 15 years ago.</p>
<p>"We had no knowledge these recordings were being redistributed as a podcast until this week," the representative tells EW. "This was long ago forgotten about."</p>
<p>A representative for Bell <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-features/kristen-bell-fox-jesus-podcast-1235469633/">told <em>Rolling Stone</em></a> that the <em>Nobody Wants This</em> star did not know about the podcast until she was asked to promote it on <em>Fox &amp; Friends</em> on Tuesday — the day before Fox News announced the project publicly — and that she never gave permission for the audio to be repurposed.</p>
<p>"This is the actual and factual story," a representative for Bell tells EW.</p>
<figure></figure><p>All of the aforementioned actors besides Harper were promoted as cast members for the 2010 project <em>Truth &amp; Life Dramatized Audio Bible</em>. All 10 of those actors played the roles for which they're credited in <em>The Life of Jesus</em> in that audio bible.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for Fox News tells EW, "Gulfstream Studios produced the 'Life of Jesus Podcast' from The Truth and Life Dramatized Audio Bible, which was licensed by FOX News Audio, with full cooperation and participation by all the actors involved."</p>
<p><em>Rolling Stone</em> also reported that a producer for the podcast sent an email to at least one actor asking that they "not mention that this audio New Testament Bible was produced years ago," because "we'd like it to feel like something that was produced more recently."</p>

<p>A representative for Rhys-Davies told <em>Rolling Stone</em> that the actor only learned about <em>The Life of Jesus</em> this week, while a representative for Cox confirmed to <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" href="https://deadline.com/2025/11/brian-cox-wasnt-aware-life-of-jesus-podcast-fox-news-1236625260/"><em>Deadline</em></a> he also had not been aware of his inclusion in the podcast.</p>
