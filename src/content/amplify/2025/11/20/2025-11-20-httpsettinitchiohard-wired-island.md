<p>When we say <strong>HARD WIRED ISLAND</strong> is cyberpunk, here's what that means to us.</p>
<p><strong>Capitalism? No thanks.</strong> Good cyberpunk is anti-capitalist. It's about how technology without ethics can make social inequality worse. The wealthy use it to cement their power and perpetuate the status quo, while marginalized communities are kept that way. The PCs want to use it to break the current system. They work against their enemies, not for them.</p>
<p><strong>Cyberpunk should be relevant.</strong> It is a study of where our society could go in the coming years. The issues faced by people in a cyberpunk setting should have <em>some</em> relevance to issues faced by the audience, even if they're not the same. Retro future, present problems.</p>
<p><strong>Cybernetics are not inherently good or bad.</strong> Like most tech, what matters is how it's used. In <strong>Hard Wired Island,</strong> the problem is that cybernetics often serves the needs of capital rather than people; Any alienating or dysphoric effects come from being reshaped into some corporation's property. There is no mechanic that suggests wearing a prosthetic makes you less human, or prone to mental illness; instead, the tradeoff of augments is adding to your financial burdens.</p>
<p><strong>Cyberpunk is not just an aesthetic.</strong> Cyberpunk shouldn't just be about the neon-lit adventures of a group of trenchcoat futurists as they amass wealth and power through violence. <strong>Hard Wired Island</strong> is about a group of marginalized people using technology to try to change the status quo.</p>
<p><strong>Many perspectives.</strong> Good cyberpunk examines how technology and power intersect in many different communities. As an orbital space station, the city of Grand Cross can and should include perspectives from all over the world. The setting includes cyborgs and androids, but they're not stand-ins for minorities; they have their own identities and issues, which can change depending on how they intersect with other things.</p>
<p><strong>HARD WIRED ISLAND</strong>'s system uses <strong>six-sided</strong> dice.</p>
<ul><li>The system includes rules and unique actions for <strong>Social</strong> situations, <strong>Stealth, Hacking,</strong> and <strong>Conflict.</strong></li><li>Each character has one or more <strong>Occupations,</strong> which define how your character solves problems: the <strong>Fixer,</strong> the <strong>Hacker</strong>, the <strong>Influencer</strong>, the <strong>Operator</strong>, the <strong>Soldier</strong>, the <strong>Street Fighter</strong>, and the <strong>Thief.</strong> Each has its own unique abilities.</li><li>Instead of wealth, characters track their <strong>Burden,</strong> which represents how comfortably they can live on Grand Cross. Between missions, characters can suffer an <strong>E</strong><strong>conomic Shock</strong> that affects how well they can perform; higher Burdens risk more frequent Shocks.</li><li>Before missions, characters create a pool of points called <strong>Prep</strong> which can be spent later on items, flashbacks, and other bonuses. This flexible system allows characters to adapt and change their plans on the fly without wasting their earlier efforts.</li><li>Characters can install cybernetic <strong>Augments</strong> to improve themselves, at the cost of increasing their Burden. (Cosmetic and medical Augments are free, so if you just want to have cat ears or a cyber-arm without any bonuses, go for it!) You can even replace your body with a full-body prosthetic.</li><li>Further rules allow characters to grow and call on a <strong>Community</strong> of side characters during play, or make a little extra side-cash with a <strong>Gig Work App.</strong></li></ul>
<p><em>"With firm pillars grounding it in the genre it wants to embody, easy to understand rules, and a vibrant setting, Hard Wired Island is worth any cyberpunk’s time to check out."</em></p>
<p>— Seamus Conneely, <a href="https://cannibalhalflinggaming.com/2021/06/04/hard-wired-island-review-hard-luck-cyberpunks-at-lagrange-5/">Cannibal Halfling Gaming</a></p>
<p><em>"There is a strange hopefulness that doesn’t just come from the fact that the PCs may be heroes, but from the fact that the PCs may get to live their lives."</em></p>
<p>— Jared Rascher, <a href="https://gnomestew.com/hard-wired-island-review/">Gnome Stew</a></p>
<p><em>"This is one of the most gorgeous and also best written RPGs I've ever looked over. It's smart and it's funny and it feels like it came out at exactly the right time. I can't think of a system I want to spend as much time with."</em></p>
<p><em><em>"</em></em><em>An excellent blend of settings and mechanics. The setting of Grand Cross is built to be explored."</em></p>
<p><em><em>"</em>This game is freaking phenomenal. Everything I could want in a cyberpunk rpg."</em></p>
<p>— itch.io reviews</p>
<p><em>"It's a game that sells itself as "cyberpunk done right", and it makes a strong case for itself all the way through."</em></p>
<p><em>"The best cyberpunk rpg I've ever seen when it comes to nailing the street level ethics of the genre."</em></p>
<p><em>"Frankly I'm impressed with the author's ability to hit every high note [...] hope is a needed commodity; for the protaganists and for us."</em></p>
