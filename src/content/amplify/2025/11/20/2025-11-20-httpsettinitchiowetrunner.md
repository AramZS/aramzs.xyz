<p><em>The year is 2150. </em><em>Climate change is finally being dealt with, but it hit the Earth hard. The seas were barely saved from collapse. Many fish are endangered or extinct. Fish are now a status symbol for the rich.</em>..</p>
<p><strong>WETRUNNER</strong> is a cyberpunk fishing TTRPG set in a post-climate-collapse world where the rich hoard fish. You play <strong>divers,</strong> the elite criminals of 2150, who stage elaborate heists to steal these fish and maybe change the world for the better. This 230-page PDF includes:</p>

<li>A detailed guide to the cyberpunk-comedy setting of <strong>Pinnacle City,</strong> where high-tech criminals steal augmented fish</li>
<li>Five heist roles for the PCs to fill: the social <strong>Angler,</strong> the forceful <strong>Biter,</strong> the thieving <strong>Hook</strong><strong>,</strong> the mastermind <strong>Line,</strong> and the hacker <strong>Sinker</strong></li>
<li>A bunch of ready-to-use factions and NPCs</li>
