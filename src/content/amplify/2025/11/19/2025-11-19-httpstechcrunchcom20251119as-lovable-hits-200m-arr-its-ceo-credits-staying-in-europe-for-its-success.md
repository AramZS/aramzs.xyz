<p>Swedish vibe coding unicorn <a href="https://lovable.dev/">Lovable</a> has doubled its annual recurring revenue (ARR) to $200 million in just four months, co-founder and CEO Anton Osika said on stage at the 2025 Slush technology conference in Helsinki, Finland.</p>
<p>The milestone comes just four months after the year-old company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/23/eight-months-in-swedish-unicorn-lovable-crosses-the-100m-arr-milestone/">surpassed $100 million in ARR in July</a>.</p>
<p>Osika credited the AI-assisted coding software maker’s decision not to move to Silicon Valley as the main reason for its success thus far. Osika said Lovable decided to stay in Europe despite getting a lot of early advice that the company would only be successful if it left the region and relocated to the U.S.</p>
<p>“It was tempting, but I really resisted that,” Osika said. “I [can] sit here now and say, ‘look, guys, you can build a global AI company from this country’. There is more available talent if you have a strong mission, and you have a lot of urgency coming together as a group and working.”</p>
<p>He added that the fact that the AI market in Europe is not as high-paced as the market in Silicon Valley has worked to his company’s benefit.</p>
<p>The company “flipped the script” by bringing strong talent from Silicon Valley companies like Notion and Gusto to work in-person in Stockholm, investor Zhenya Loginov, a partner at Accel, said.</p>
<p>Osika also credited the company’s open-source community for continuing to improve its technology.</p>

<p>“We just see all of these people in the community driving forward,” Osika said. “They’ve been active voices on Discord for, I think, the last 1,000 hours, debating some kind of WordPress operation. That was powering what we’re doing.”</p>
<p>Lovable’s milestone comes as vibe coding continues to gobble up venture capital and see soaring traction among users. Last week AI-coding assistant <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/13/coding-assistant-cursor-raises-2-3b-5-months-after-its-previous-round/">Cursor announced it raised $2.3 billion</a> in a new funding round that valued the company at $29.3 billion in a round Accel also helped lead.</p>
<p>Lovable has raised more than $225 million in venture funding since it was founded a year ago. The startup most recently raised a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/17/lovable-becomes-a-unicorn-with-200m-series-a-just-8-months-after-launch/">$200 million Series A round</a> in July led by Accel in addition to more than 20 other investors. That round valued the company at $1.8 billion.</p>
