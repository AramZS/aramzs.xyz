<p><i><p><i>By </i>Isabela Espadas Barros Leal and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/tony-romm">Tony Romm</a></p></i></p>
<p>The Supreme Court late Friday <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/07/us/politics/trump-court-food-stamps.html">temporarily allowed</a> the Trump administration to continue to withhold some funding for food stamps, the nation’s largest anti-hunger program, the latest twist in a dizzying legal battle with great stakes for millions of low-income Americans.</p>
<p>The order from Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson paused, at least for now, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/06/us/politics/snap-food-stamps-shutdown-trump.html">the directive of a lower court judge</a>, who had ordered the Trump administration to fully fund benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.</p>
<p>The matter now rests in the hands of a federal appeals court, which is considering whether to maintain that pause, known as a stay, or allow the lower court judge’s order to take effect. The appeals court is expected to rule quickly.</p>
<p>In the meantime, states have struggled to interpret a series of conflicting rulings and changing developments, which by Saturday appeared to further disrupt food stamp benefits for some of the roughly one in eight Americans who receive them.</p>
<p>Here’s a timeline of the SNAP developments:</p>
<p><strong>Oct. 1:</strong> The government shutdown begins after lawmakers in Congress failed to strike a deal to fund federal agencies and programs. The closure did not immediately affect SNAP, however, which was able to pay benefits for the month.</p>
<p><strong>Oct. 24:</strong> The Trump administration <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/24/us/politics/trump-food-stamps-shutdown.html">informed states</a> that it would not tap a reserve of about $5 billion to provide even partial benefits under SNAP, which normally costs about $8 billion a month. The decision by the Agriculture Department marked a reversal from the agency’s own public guidance, issued earlier in the fiscal standoff in Washington, which said it would use its contingency funds to sustain the food stamp program.</p>
<p><strong>Oct. 28:</strong> Roughly two dozen states <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/28/us/politics/trump-food-stamps-snap-lawsuit.html">sued the Trump administration</a> over its refusal to continue to fund SNAP. The states, including Arizona, California and Massachusetts, described the cuts as unnecessary and illegal, and they asked a federal judge in Boston to order the Agriculture Department to restart funding to avoid benefit cuts in November.</p>
<p><strong>Oct. 30:</strong> A second coalition of cities, religious groups and other nonprofits sued the Trump administration in federal court in Rhode Island. They raised some of the same issues as the states as they looked to force the release of SNAP funds.</p>
<p>The Trump administration <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/30/us/politics/food-stamps-shutdown.html">staunchly defended</a> its decision to halt SNAP funds at a hearing before a federal judge in Massachusetts, who expressed deep skepticism with the arguments raised by the Justice Department. The government had even acknowledged ahead of that hearing that it had plenty of funds available in two accounts: an emergency fund for SNAP and a second reserve filled primarily with tariff revenue. But the Trump administration said it faced legal, technical and budgetary constraints that prevented it from transferring the money.</p>
<p><strong>Oct. 31:</strong> Judge John J. McConnell Jr., of the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/31/us/politics/federal-judge-food-stamps.html">ruled against</a> the Trump administration. Siding with cities and nonprofits, he said the government had to tap emergency money for SNAP — and consider using a second tranche of funds, largely comprising tariff revenue — to pay benefits quickly.</p>
<p><strong>Nov. 1:</strong> In a written version of his earlier ruling, Judge McConnell gave the administration a choice: It could make <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/01/us/politics/trump-food-stamp-payments.html">full or partial SNAP payments</a> that week to alleviate “irreparable harm” facing food stamp recipients. No matter which option it chose — and which funding source it used — the judge ordered the government to act with haste and during that week.</p>
<p><strong>Nov. 3:</strong> The administration revealed in a set of court filings that it would send <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/03/us/politics/snap-food-stamps-trump.html">partial payments</a> to SNAP recipients. Initially, the government said that eligible households could receive about half as much in benefits, and it warned that those benefits could be severely delayed. But guidance issued days later by the Agriculture Department revealed the cuts and delays would be much more extensive — leaving some families to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/05/us/politics/snap-payments-white-house.html">receive no aid at all</a> in November.</p>
<p><strong>Nov. 4:</strong> President Trump threatened on social media to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/04/us/politics/cities-nonprofits-food-stamp-snap-payments.html">defy the federal court order</a>, saying that SNAP payments “will be given only when the Radical Left Democrats open up government, which they can easily do, and not before!” Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, later said the administration would be “fully complying” with the court order.</p>
<p><strong>Nov. 6:</strong> The same federal judge in Rhode Island ordered that food stamps <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/06/us/politics/snap-food-stamps-shutdown-trump.html">must be paid in full</a> by Nov. 7. He sharply criticized the administration for holding up SNAP for “political reasons,” and required the government to use both emergency funds and its additional account to provide full benefits in November.</p>
<p>Vice President JD Vance criticized the judge’s “absurd ruling,” and the Justice Department quickly said it would appeal.</p>
<p><strong>Nov. 7:</strong> In its appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, the Justice Department argued that there was no “lawful basis” to force the president to fund SNAP payments in full. The court declined to impose an immediate halt to the order, prompting an emergency appeal from the administration to the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>Later that night, Justice Jackson <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/07/us/politics/trump-court-food-stamps.html">temporarily halted</a> the Rhode Island court’s order to give the appeals court additional time to weigh elements of the case. But states including New York, Kansas, Pennsylvania and Oregon had already started to release full benefits to their residents, adding uncertainty to how the Supreme Court’s administrative stay would affect the payments.</p>
<p><strong>Nov. 8:</strong> One day after the ruling, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/08/us/politics/families-food-stamps-supreme-court-order.html">many states</a> struggled to sort through the confusion. Some states had to delay their plans to provide full SNAP benefits, while some food stamp recipients experienced trouble using their benefits to buy groceries.</p>
