<p>The planned sale of the parent company of the British media outlet The Daily Telegraph collapsed on Friday, raising questions about the fate of the publication seen as an advocate of the country’s Conservative Party.</p>
<p>Its planned acquirer, the American investment firm RedBird Capital Partners, said it had withdrawn its takeover offer for the parent, the Telegraph Media Group.</p>
<p>The announcement throws the future of The Telegraph into question. Founded in 1855, the paper was known for most of its history for its right-leaning politics and support of the Conservative Party. (Among its nicknames is “The Torygraph.”)</p>
<p>It is unclear who may bid for The Telegraph now, though several media moguls had shown interest.</p>
<p>A representative for Telegraph Media said the company’s immediate priority was “to minimize disruption to the business and work with all stakeholders,” including the government, on a solution.</p>
<p>The move comes nearly six months after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/23/business/daily-telegraph-uk-sale-redbird-capital.html">RedBird agreed to buy control</a> of the media company, valuing it at 500 million pounds, or $658 million. Among the investment firm’s plans had been to expand the publication’s international footprint, especially in the United States.</p>
<p>RedBird’s previous offer to buy Telegraph Media Group, announced in 2023 in partnership with a fund controlled by a member of Abu Dhabi’s royal family, was blocked amid political outcry over foreign state ownership of British media assets.</p>
<p>Last year, the Conservative-led government <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/13/business/media/jeff-zucker-telegraph-delay.html">passed a law</a> barring foreign states from owning British newspapers.</p>
<p>The subsequent Labour Party government <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/media-law-reforms-to-boost-press-sustainability-and-protect-independence">relaxed that restriction</a>, though ministers suggested that RedBird’s takeover bid would <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/10/16/telegraph-takeover-may-face-national-security-investigation/">face further scrutiny</a>.</p>
<p>RedBird gave no immediate reason for its withdrawal. A spokeswoman said in a statement: “We remain fully confident that The Telegraph and its world-class team have a bright future ahead of them, and we will work hard to help secure a solution which is in the best interests of employees and readers.”</p>
<p>The takeover bid, and ties between China and RedBird’s chairman, John L. Thornton, had received scrutiny in both the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/10/29/red-flags-redbird-spymaster-beijing-banker-telegraph/">news</a> and the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/10/21/britain-must-not-sell-free-press-those-who-would-silence-it/">opinion</a> pages in The Telegraph itself.</p>
