Fuentes, whose followers call themselves “groypers,” openly espouses antisemitic conspiracy theories and once called Adolf Hitler “awesome.”</p><p>“We’ve had some great interviews with Tucker Carlson, but you can’t tell him who to interview,” Trump <a href="https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/transcript/donald-trump-press-gaggle-before-air-force-one-departure-november-16-2025/" target="_blank">told reporters</a>. “I mean, if he wants to interview Nick Fuentes — I don’t know much about him, but if he wants to do it, get the word out, let him. You know, people have to decide. Ultimately, people have to decide.”</p><p class="rw-outer-content"><span>Some content could not be imported from the original document.</span> <a href="https://washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/11/17/trump-defends-tucker-carlson/">View content ↗ </a></p><p class="rw-outer-content"><span>Some content could not be imported from the original document.</span> <a href="https://washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/11/17/trump-defends-tucker-carlson/">View content ↗ </a></p><p class="rw-outer-content"><span>Some content could not be imported from the original document.</span> <a href="https://washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/11/17/trump-defends-tucker-carlson/">View content ↗ </a></p><p>Trump later indicated again that he did not see a problem with Carlson granting Fuentes a friendly interview.</p><p class="rw-outer-content"><span>Some content could not be imported from the original document.</span> <a href="https://washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/11/17/trump-defends-tucker-carlson/">View content ↗ </a></p><p>“Meeting people, talking to people — like for somebody like Tucker, that’s what they do,” Trump said. “You know, people are controversial. Some are, some aren’t.”</p><p>Trump’s comments defending Carlson were the first he has made about the Fuentes interview since it <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/11/08/nick-fuentes-tucker-carlson-hate-speech/" target="_blank">triggered a MAGA civil war</a> over who should be welcome — and what rhetoric should be tolerated — in the conservative movement. The <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/11/06/heritage-foundation-tucker-carlson/" target="_blank">infighting has consumed the Heritage Foundation</a>, a right-wing think tank that produced Project 2025, after its president defended Carlson for the interview.</p><p class="rw-outer-content"><span>Some content could not be imported from the original document.</span> <a href="https://washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/11/17/trump-defends-tucker-carlson/">View content ↗ </a></p><p>The backlash echoes the rare rebukes that Trump received from within the GOP after his 2022 <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/11/25/trump-fuentes-ye/" target="_blank">dinner at Mar-a-Lago</a> with Fuentes and the rapper Ye (formerly known as Kanye West), who also has a history of making antisemitic remarks. On Sunday night, Trump again downplayed that dinner.</p><p>“Kanye asked if he could have dinner, and he brought Nick,” Trump said. “I didn’t know Nick at the time.”</p><p>Fuentes, 27, was once barred from nearly every social media platform and an array of payment processors, either for violating hate-speech policies or for encouraging rioters to storm the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.</p><p>Elon Musk, who owns the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, reinstated Fuentes’s X account, and he now has more than 1 million followers there. Online and in his podcast, Fuentes has continued to rail against conservatives who support Israel and to push racist and antisemitic ideas.</p><p class="rw-outer-content"><span>Some content could not be imported from the original document.</span> <a href="https://washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/11/17/trump-defends-tucker-carlson/">View content ↗ </a></p><p class="rw-outer-content"><span>Some content could not be imported from the original document.</span> <a href="https://washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/11/17/trump-defends-tucker-carlson/">View content ↗ </a></p><p>“Jews are running society, women need to shut the … up, Blacks need to be imprisoned for the most part, and we would live in paradise. It’s that simple,” Fuentes said on his podcast in March.</p><p>In recent months, Fuentes has broken with Trump over his support of Israel, <a href="https://x.com/NickJFuentes/status/1988422716874203645" target="_blank">calling Trump’s second term</a> “objectively a colossal disappointment and a catastrophic failure.”</p><p>“MAGA is dead,” Fuentes <a href="https://x.com/NickJFuentes/status/1988697670190526602" target="_blank">declared last week</a>.</p><p>But Fuentes seemed to take Trump’s defense of Carlson as a tacit defense of him as well, <a href="https://x.com/NickJFuentes/status/1990230328984707450" target="_blank">sharing a clip</a> of Trump’s Sunday night remarks on X with a note: “Thank you Mr. President!”</p><p><i>Will Oremus contributed to this report.</i></p></body></html>
