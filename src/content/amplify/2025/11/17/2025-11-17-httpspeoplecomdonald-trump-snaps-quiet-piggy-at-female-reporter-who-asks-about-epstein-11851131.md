<p>President <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://people.com/tag/donald-trump/">Donald Trump</a> raised some eyebrows during several tense exchanges with members of the press over the weekend.</p>
<p>During a Nov. 14 press gaggle on Air Force One as he flew from D.C. to his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida for the weekend, Trump was, of course, asked about the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://people.com/what-are-the-epstein-files-11781622">Epstein files</a>, amid a continued congressional push to release the remainder of the evidence against the late billionaire and convicted sex offender.</p>
<p>On Nov. 12, Democrats on the House Oversight Committee <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://people.com/jeffrey-epstein-claimed-donald-trump-knew-about-girls-new-email-files-11847714">released three new pieces of email correspondence</a> from Epstein, allegedly obtained by his estate.</p>
<p>In one exchange, between Epstein and his personal confidante, <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://people.com/where-is-ghislaine-maxwell-now-11780977">Ghislaine Maxwell</a>, Epstein calls Trump "that dog that hasn't barked."</p>
<p>"[Redacted victim's name] spent hours at my house with him ,, he has never once been mentioned," he added.</p>
<p>Maxwell replied, "I have been thinking about that..."</p>

<p>In another email, this one with Trump biographer Michael Wolff, Epstein wrote, "Trump said he asked me to resign, never a member ever."</p>
<p>"Of course, he knew about the girls," he continued, referring to rumors — which Trump has denied — that Epstein and Maxwell used Mar-a-Lago to <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://people.com/virginia-giuffre-recalls-how-ghislaine-maxwell-approached-her-at-mar-a-lago-11830045">scout potential trafficking victims</a>. "as he asked ghislaine to stop."</p>
<p>Speaking with reporters days after the emails' release, Trump insisted. "I know nothing about that. They would have announced that a long time ago."</p>
<p>"Jeffrey Epstein and I had a very bad relationship for many years," he added.</p>
<p>When an off-camera female reporter — <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" href="https://x.com/JenniferJJacobs/status/1989766778893832469?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1989766778893832469%7Ctwgr%5Ed7e9443c612286ad8890bc2797551ef6a46a153e%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fnypost.com%2F2025%2F11%2F17%2Fmedia%2Ftrump-blasts-reporter-who-interrupted-him-you-are-the-worst%2F">later identified</a> as a Bloomberg reporter — began to ask if there was anything "incriminating" in the Epstein emails, Trump pointed a finger in her face.</p>
<p>"Quiet. Quiet, Piggy," he said menacingly.</p>
<p>"Piggy" has reportedly been a favored insult of the president's in the past. During his 2016 presidential campaign, former Miss Universe Alicia Machado, who won the title at age 19 while Trump was a co-owner of the organization, <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://people.com/health/donald-trump-debate-miss-universe-alicia-machado/">claimed that Trump threatened</a> to take away her title after she gained weight.</p>
<p>“He was overwhelming, I was so scared of him,” Machado said in Spanish at the time. “He’d yell at me all the time. He’d tell me, ‘You look ugly,’ or ‘You look fat.’ Sometimes he’d ‘play’ with me and say: ‘Hello, Miss Piggy,’ ‘Hello, Miss Housekeeping.’ ”</p>
<p>Two days after the Air Force One viral moment, Trump <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uea1vQn4QqM">snapped at another reporter</a> for asking him about <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://people.com/tag/tucker-carlson/">Tucker Carlson</a>'s recent interview with far-right podcaster Nick Fuentes.</p>
<p>"Well, I found him to be good. I mean, he's said good things about me over the years. He's, I think he's good," he said, referring to Carlson. "We've had some good interviews. I did an interview with him where we had 300 million hits."</p>
<p>When the reporter began to ask a follow-up as Trump was still talking, the president responded, "Will you let me finish my statement? You are the worst."</p>
<p>"You're with Bloomberg, right?" he continued. "You are the worst. I don't know why they even have you."</p>

<p>Following that gaggle, the president walked across the White House lawn back to the presidential residence and appeared to pass a flag pole where the American flag <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://people.com/donald-trump-white-house-american-flag-appears-ground-he-walked-past-11850598">had been lowered to the ground</a>.</p>

<p>The photo was widely circulated on social media by critics of the president, who questioned why the flag was seemingly left drooping. Title 4 of the U.S. Flag Code, Chapter 1, states, "The flag should never touch anything beneath it, such as the ground, the floor, water, or merchandise."</p>
<p>“This is fake news," White House spokesman Davis Ingle told PEOPLE in a statement. "The beautiful American flag on the White House South Lawn that was recently installed by President Trump never touched the ground. Due to the high winds on Sunday evening in the Washington, D.C. area, the flag was lowered into a special container out of an abundance of caution during the Marine One landing."</p>
