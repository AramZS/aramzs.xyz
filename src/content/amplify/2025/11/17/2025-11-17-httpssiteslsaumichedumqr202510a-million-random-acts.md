<p>A Million Random Acts<br/>
Mark Sample</p>
<p>(html, css, javascript)</p>
<p>A Million Random Acts is a procedurally-generated grid of thousands of flash fiction stories drawn from the headlines, a futile attempt to capture the chaos of an America under attack from the inside by autocrats and oligarchs. Each of the stories comes from a bespoke small language model, handcrafted by the author.</p>
<p>The model resides in a “grammar”—that is, a contextless, probabilistic template into which various curated words and phrases—and importantly, sub-grammars—may be slotted. A Million Random Acts fits into a long history of combinatory poetics, from Christopher Strachey’s Love Letter Generator (1953) to Alison Knowles’ The House of Dust (1967), to the contemporary work of J.R. Carpenter and Allison Parrish. In the case of A Million Random Acts, the nested structure of the complex grammar ensures a virtually uncountable number of variations. A ChatGPT analysis of the grammar estimates 2.42 × 1026 (242 septillion) unique variations, while Claude AI more conservatively estimates 6.5 × 1017 (650 quadrillion) unique variations, more than the number grains of sand on Earth. At any given time, of course, not all possibilities are represented. Any single instantiation of A Million Random Acts generates only a subset of these total possibilities, yet that subset is itself vast. Like Nick Montfort and Stephanie Strickland’s groundbreaking work, Sea and Spar Between (2011), A Million Random Acts takes the form of a vast grid, onto which its stories—or stanzas, if you will—are mapped. The grid can be explored with a keyboard (using the arrow keys to pan and the A and Z keys to zoom), a mouse (using the mouse to drag the grid and mousewheel to zoom), or touch on a mobile device (swiping to move the grid and pinching to zoom). The grid is bounded, but because it loops in every direction, the overall feeling is one of infinite expanse.</p>
<p>The nested grammars and interactive grid are made possible by two Javascript libraries: Daniel Howe’s rita.js and Lauren McCarthy’s p5.js, respectively. The top level of the grammar for A Million Random Acts contains 15 possible “story” types. These types range from accounts of censorship to acts of violence, from speculative stock exchanges to eavesdropped yet incomprehensible text conversations. Each story type has multiple sub-templates, each with their own sub-sub-templates. Many of the stanzas are complete. Others are fragments, or fragmented, as if language has failed the task set before it. Rather than explain these stories in detail or what’s going on in some of the more oblique stanzas, I leave it to the reader to make sense of the piece, both the individual stanzas and the totality of the work.</p>
<p>Importantly, A Million Random Acts has no beginning nor end. In “The Rejection of Closure,” the language poet Lyn Hejinian makes the case for what she calls “open” poems. Open poems have no closure. An open poem “gives the impression that it begins and ends arbitrarily.” With an open work like A Million Random Acts there is no origin point, and also no final moment. The work exceeds its own linguistic and semantic boundaries. The reader can never finish the work, will never exhaust the work. If they stop reading, it’s not because, as Hejinian puts it, everything has been said, but because the reader has run out of time. I will say a final word about one aesthetic principle at work in A Million Random Acts. I expect the reader to feel both overwhelmed and numbed by the piece. It’s an aesthetic effect the critic Sianne Ngai has termed “stuplimity”—a perverse amalgam of the stupid and the sublime. Ngai describes the stuplime as “a mixture of shock and exhaustion” in which “astonishment is paradoxically united with boredom.”</p>
<p>The stuplime arguably describes any experience on the internet these days, with the endless doomscrolling that characterizes so much of our engagement online. Given that one of its etymological forebears is the word stupidity, one might expect stuplimity to be a negative aesthetic. But that need not be the case. Ngai suggests that shock and boredom alike can challenge our assumptions about the right way to view, interact, or even critique something. Stuplimity can spur us to look for what Ngai describes as “new strategies of engagement.” A Million Random Acts implicitly—and occasionally explicitly—demands exactly that: new modes, tactics, and strategies of engagement. Because we, like the readers of all open texts, are running out of time.</p>
