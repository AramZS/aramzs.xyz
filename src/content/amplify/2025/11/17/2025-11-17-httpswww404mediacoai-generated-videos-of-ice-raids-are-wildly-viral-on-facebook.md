<p>“Watch your step sir, keep moving,” a police officer with a vest that reads ICE and a patch that reads “POICE” says to a Latino-appearing man wearing a Walmart employee vest. He leads him toward a bus that reads “IMMIGRATION AND CERS.” Next to him, one of his colleagues begins walking unnaturally sideways, one leg impossibly darting through another as he heads to the back of a line of other Latino Walmart employees who are apparently being detained by ICE. Two American flag emojis are superimposed on the video, as is the text “Deportation.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/reel/1910803682809597"><u>The video</u></a> has 4 million views, 16,600 likes, 1,900 comments, and 2,200 shares on Facebook. It was, obviously, generated by OpenAI's Sora.</p>
<p>Some of the comments seem to understand this: “Why is he walking like that?” one says. “AI the guys foot goes through his leg,” another says. Many of the comments clearly do not: “Oh, you’ll find lots of them at Walmart,” another top comment reads. “Walmart doesn’t do paperwork before they hire you?” another says. “They removing zombies from Walmart before Halloween?”</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.404media.co/where-facebooks-ai-slop-comes-from/"><u>latest trend in Facebook’s ever downward spiral down the AI slop toilet</u></a> are AI deportation videos. These are posted by an account called “USA Journey 897” and have the general vibe of actual propaganda videos posted by ICE and the Department of Homeland Security’s social media accounts. Many of the AI videos focus on workplace deportations, but some are similar to horrifying, real videos we have seen from ICE raids in Chicago and Los Angeles. The account <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/chadloder.bsky.social/post/3m5fq7oas3222?ref=404media.co"><u>was initially flagged to 404 Media by Chad Loder</u></a>, an independent researcher.</p>
<p>The videos universally have text superimposed over the three areas of a video where OpenAI’s Sora video generator places watermarks. This, as well as the style of the videos being generated and tests done by 404 Media to make very similar videos, show that they were generated with Sora, highlighting how tools released by some of the richest companies in the world are being combined to generate and monetize videos that take advantage of human suffering (and how incredibly easy it is to hide a Sora watermark).</p>
<p>“PLEASE THAT’S MY BABY,” a dark-skinned woman screams <a href="https://www.facebook.com/reel/824689163779255/?s=fb_shorts_profile&amp;stack_idx=0"><u>while being restrained by an ICE officer</u></a> in another video. “Ma’am stop resisting, keep moving,” an officer says back. The camera switches to an image of the baby: “YOU CAN’T TAKE ME FROM HER, PLEASE SHE’S RIGHT THERE. DON’T DO THIS, SHE’S JUST A BABY. I LOVE YOU, MAMA LOVES YOU,” the woman says. The video switches to a scene of the woman in the back of an ICE van. The video has 1,400 likes and 407 comments, which include “ Don’t separate them….take them ALL!,” “Take the baby too,” and “I think the days of use those child anchors are about over with.”</p>
