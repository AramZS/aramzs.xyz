We’ll be door-knocking, phone-banking, communicating, and organizing at the neighborhood, city, and state level. To get it done, we’ll collaborate with community organizations, movement groups, and unions that have been doing this work and share a commitment to the affordability agenda.</p>
<p>Our victory was historic, but the campaign for an affordable New York City is just beginning. Even as billionaires have made their opposition clear, more than 100,000 volunteers helped win this election, and they want to keep going. Our Time can be a vehicle for continued engagement — a way for folks to plug in and stay active while they find a long-term political home.</p>
<p>These folks are helping get the organization off the ground, and we’re just getting started. We want to build a team from and with our community of volunteers. Open positions will be posted soon.</p>
<p>No. We're not asking for dues or formal membership. This is a campaign you can be part of, and grow in, alongside other membership organizations you belong to — or while you find your long-term political home. We want to make it as easy as possible to get involved: show up when you can, contribute how you can.</p>
<p>No. While we're building on the campaign's volunteer culture and community, and its operational excellence, Our Time is a fully independent organization. We're also not directed by any elected official. We'll evolve our approach and goals while maintaining the spirit of what brought us all together.</p>
<p>Our Time is a newly incorporated 501(c)(4) organization, allowing us to engage directly in the political process. We're independent but aligned — not directed by any elected official, but committed to delivering on the affordability agenda.</p>
<p>Sign up to stay connected and we'll be in touch about ways to plug in! After a post-election break, we'll begin hosting events with our team, field leads, and volunteers to plan our next moves, starting in early December. There will be multiple ways to engage based on availability and interest.</p>
<p>Yes, please! We are accepting donations from individuals, foundations, and other philanthropic organizations. All donations greater than $1000 will be disclosed publicly on our website. For now, please email <a href="mailto:hello@ourtime.nyc">hello@ourtime.nyc</a> if you are interested in making a donation! We will have a web-based donation form soon. We can accept non-tax-deductible donations for 501(c)(4) social welfare purposes. Please also reach out if you are interested in making a tax-deductible donation to support charitable and educational activity aligned with our mission.</p>
