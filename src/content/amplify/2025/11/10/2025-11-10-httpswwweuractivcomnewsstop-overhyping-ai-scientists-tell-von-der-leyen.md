<p>A group of scientists has called on Commission President Ursula von der Leyen to retract a statement she made earlier this year when she suggested artificial intelligence would soon reach parity with human intelligence.</p>
<p>“We thought AI would only approach human reasoning around 2050,” von der Leyen <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/speech_25_1284">said</a> at the annual EU budget conference in May. “Now we expect this to happen already next year.”</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://www.iccl.ie/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/20251110_Scientists-letter-to-the-President-AI-Hype.pdf">open letter</a> addressed to von der Leyen on Monday, more than 70 scientists call out the EU’s president for hyping AI, including two members of the UN’s high-level advisory body on AI.</p>
<p>Following a request from the group of scientists, the Commission disclosed that von der Leyen’s claim of impending human-parity AI was based on “the professional knowledge of Commission services, and desk review of scientific literature”.</p>
<p>As references, the EU’s executive pointed to several statements from professionals – including the prominent AI academic Yoshua Bengio and the CEOs of AI developers Anthropic and OpenAI, as well as the chief exec of AI chipmaker Nvidia.</p>
<p>“These are marketing statements driven by profit-motive and ideology rather than empirical evidence and formal proof,” the scientists write in the letter.</p>
<p>By repeating the AI industry’s marketing von der Leyen is undermining Europe’s credibility, they argue.</p>
<p>“The scientific development of any potentially useful AI is not served by amplifying the unscientific marketing claims of US tech firms,” the letter adds.</p>
<p>The two UN advisors among the signatories are Abeba Birhane and Virginia Dignum. Luc Steels, a prominent Belgian AI researcher, also put his name to the letter.</p>
<p>The Commission did not immediately respond to Euractiv asking for comment on the open letter.</p>
