<p>When Starbucks Corp. <a data-component="link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-25/starbucks-to-close-stores-cut-jobs-in-1-billion-restructuring">fired 900 corporate employees in September</a>, economists hardly batted an eye. After all, the coffee chain had already done a <a data-component="link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-24/starbucks-cuts-1-100-corporate-jobs-in-bid-to-speed-turnaround">February culling</a> as part of new management’s drive to get the Frappuccino maker back on track. In October, Target Corp. <a data-component="link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-23/target-to-lay-off-8-of-headquarters-team-cut-1-800-roles">eliminated 1,800 roles</a> to help the beleaguered retailer move faster. For each corporate cutback, there’s been a clear explanation: Amazon.com (<a data-component="link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-28/amzn-amazon-to-cut-14-000-jobs-across-corporate-workforce">14,000 corporate jobs</a>) blamed artificial intelligence; Paramount (<a data-component="link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-27/paramount-to-cut-1-000-jobs-wednesday-in-first-round-of-layoffs">1,000 workers</a>) just completed a merger; Molson Coors (<a data-component="link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-20/molson-coors-cutting-400-salaried-jobs-amid-weak-beer-demand">400 jobs</a>) can’t get carb-conscious consumers to drink enough beer.</p>
<p>Separately, each announcement can be read as a one-off. Yet taken together, some economists worry that the recent spate of cuts is starting to look a little less like individual belt-tightening and more like a warning sign.</p>
