<h3>from the <i>the-absurd-stupidity.-it-burns</i> dept</h3>
<p>60 Minutes is <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2025/10/21/bari-weiss-gets-to-work-fixing-cbs-bias-by-making-it-more-biased/">under new management</a> and things are getting stupid faster than you might expect. Last night’s episode <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/video/1122025-president-trump-guinness-book-of-records/">featured President Trump,</a> which is currently being described as <a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/we-watched-trumps-60-minutes-interview">“nuts.”</a> There are all sorts of crazy moments to call out, but let’s start with the recursively meta nonsense.</p>
<p>60 Minutes edited out a segment where Donald Trump tells them to edit out a segment in which he brags about getting CBS to pay him because of them editing out part of an answer by Kamala Harris, and he notes that CBS clearly did the wrong thing in editing Harris in the same fucking sentence he tells them to edit out what he’s saying.</p>
<p>It is so fucking stupid.</p>
<p>As you’ll no doubt recall, last year, Trump <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2024/11/04/trumps-latest-lawsuit-against-cbs-proves-hes-no-free-speech-champion/">sued CBS</a> over the show. Right before last year’s election, 60 Minutes had interviewed Kamala Harris. As every such news show does, it had edited the interview down to make it fit into the TV time slot. MAGA culture warriors, desperate for anything to culture war about, started screaming that 60 Minutes had edited Harris to sound more coherent. This was nonsense.</p>
<p>What had happened was that in one question, Harris had given a long answer. CBS broadcast part of the answer on 60 Minutes. But it had broadcast a different part of that answer during the CBS Sunday morning show, Face the Nation. This… happens all the time. The full answer was too long. They edited it down to a shorter bit. The two different broadcasts chose different parts. That’s basic, fundamental, editorial discretion.</p>
<p>Given how often Trump is edited to make him sound more coherent, he should appreciate this. But Trump will never, ever care about how much leeway he is given and will always seek to gain whatever advantage he can. So he sued, claiming it was “election interference,” which it wasn’t. And even if it was (it wasn’t) he still won the election.</p>
<p>But Trump’s censor in chief Brendan Carr made it clear that the only way he’d approve Paramount’s (owner of CBS) sale to Skydance was if they first bribed Trump by agreeing to settle this frivolous case. So they <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2025/07/03/institutional-failure-cbs-wimps-out-pays-trump-16-million-bribe-to-settle-baseless-lawsuit/">paid a $16 million bribe</a> just to get the case settled, while agreeing to <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2025/08/12/trump-fcc-installs-babysitter-at-cbs-to-ensure-the-network-kisses-king-donalds-ass/">install a Trump lackey</a> as an internal censor at the network.</p>
<p>Trump’s full interview was 73 minutes long, but 60 Minutes only aired 28 minutes of it. They then did release the longer interview online <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/read-full-transcript-norah-odonnell-60-minutes-interview-with-president-trump/">along with a transcript</a>, which caused people to look at what was edited. And that included this segment:</p>
<blockquote> <p><em>TRUMP: And actually 60 Minutes paid me a lotta money. And you don’t have to put this on, because I don’t wanna embarrass you, and I’m sure you’re not– you have a great– I think you have a great, new leader, frankly, who’s the young woman that’s leading your whole enterprise is a great– from what I know.</em></p> <p><em>I don’t know her, but I hear she’s a great person. But 60 Minutes was forced to pay me– a lot of money because they took her answer out that was so bad, it was election-changing, two nights before the election. And they put a new answer in. And they paid me a lot of money for that. You can’t have fake news. You’ve gotta have legit news. And I think that it’s happening. I see–</em></p> <p><em>NORAH O’DONNELL: Mr. President–</em></p> <p><em>TRUMP: –I see good things happening in the news. I really do. And I think one of the best things to happen is this show and new ownership, CBS and new ownership. I think it’s the greatest thing that’s happened in a long time to a free and open and good press.</em></p> </blockquote>
<p>Again, I feel the need to repeat this because it is so incredibly stupid. Literally in the same sentence where he says CBS had to pay him “a lotta money” because it edited a 60 Minutes interview, he tells them to edit the interview not to air that section. Then he claims “you can’t have fake news.” Even though what he’s claiming is literally fake news. They didn’t pay him because they changed the answer. They paid him to get their merger done. Everyone knows it.</p>
<p>And, yes, I’m sure some people will try to defend this, but come on. There’s no defense. The President views everything in simple terms: “if it helps me, it’s good, if it doesn’t, it should be illegal.” It’s a narcissistic simpleton’s understanding of the world. And he’s in charge. It’s fucking crazy.</p>
<p>Speaking of fucking crazy, there were so many other crazy bits in the interview, but let’s just call out two. After all, the request to edit the section of the interview, while hypocritical, is nothing compared to the blatant corruption he admits to, or his desire to unleash the American war machine on American people.</p>
<p>Let’s start with this: just last week, MAGA loyalist <a href="https://oversight.house.gov/release/oversight-committee-releases-report-on-the-biden-autopen-presidency/">Rep. James Comer released what may be the least self-aware report ever</a>, screaming about how White House aides covered up Joe Biden’s mental and physical decline and because of that he didn’t know who he was pardoning, meaning those pardons should be null and void.</p>
<p>This comes the same week that people are <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/trump-mri-scan-raises-specter-110000963.html">raising serious questions</a> about White House aides covering up the true nature of Trump’s physical and mental decline. And, now he’s admitting he has no idea who he’s pardoning—the very thing the Comer report claims means the pardons are void.</p>
<p>Two weeks ago, Trump (or whoever within the White House) <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/23/trump-pardons-binance-founder-cz-zhao.html">pardoned CZ</a>, the founder of Binance, who had pleaded guilty to money laundering. Though, when asked about it that day, Trump appeared to have no idea who CZ was, even though he had also (just coincidentally) given billions to the Trump family’s cryptocurrency business.</p>
<p>And even though he’d flubbed that question when he was asked about it right after the pardon was announced, when 60 Minutes asked him about it, he doubled down—seemingly proud of his ignorance. Which is bold, considering his administration’s entire argument against Biden’s pardons rests on the claim that Biden didn’t know who he was pardoning:</p>

<p>From the full (unedited) transcript, which is way worse than that short clip above:</p>
<blockquote> <p><em>NORAH O’DONNELL: This is a question about pardons. The Trump family is now perhaps more associated with cryptocurrency than real estate. You and your son– your sons, Don Jr. and Eric, have formed World Liberty Financial with the Witkoff family.</em></p> <p><em>PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Right.</em></p> <p><em>NORAH O’DONNELL: Helping to make your family millions of dollars. It’s in that context that I do wanna ask you about crypto’s richest man, a billionaire known as C.Z. He pled guilty in 2023 to violating anti-money laundering laws.</em></p> <p><em>PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Right.</em></p> <p><em>NORAH O’DONNELL: Looked at this, the government at the time said that C.Z. had caused “significant harm to U.S. national security”, essentially by allowing terrorist groups like Hamas to move millions of dollars around. Why did you pardon him?</em></p> <p><em>PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Okay, are you ready?</em> <strong><em>I don’t know who he is</em></strong><em>.</em></p> </blockquote>
<p>Um. That’s worse. <a href="https://youtu.be/TY36D6qc0dw?si=qoRlwgGec2inRfyq&amp;t=142">You do get how that’s worse, right?</a></p>
<p>Trump’s own administration is claiming Biden’s pardons are invalid because he didn’t know who he was pardoning. And Trump just proudly announced, on camera, that he has no idea who CZ is.</p>
<p>Then he admits that his sons basically told him to do this for their crypto business:</p>
<blockquote> <p><em>My sons are involved in crypto much more than I– me. I– I know very little about it, other than one thing. It’s a huge industry. And if we’re not gonna be the head of it, China, Japan, or someplace else is. So I am behind it 100%. This man was, in my opinion, from what I was told, this is, you know, a four-month sentence.</em></p> <p><em>But this man was treated really badly by the Biden administration. And he was given a jail term. He’s highly respected. He’s a very successful guy. They sent him to jail and they really set him up. That’s my opinion. I was told about it.</em></p> </blockquote>
<p>By who? Who told you about it? A good reporter would have stepped in and asked that question, but this is the new Bari Weiss 60 Minutes where you won’t see follow-ups like that. Or if you did, they’d be edited out.</p>
<p>He continues:</p>
<blockquote> <p><em>I was told that he was a victim, just like I was and just like many other people, of a vicious, horrible group of people in the Biden administration.</em></p> </blockquote>
<p>Again, “who told you this?” is the next question any reporter should be asking. O’Donnell did not. Though she at least did point out that he pleaded guilty to allowing terrorist groups to engage in money laundering, which seems notable for a guy who keeps talking about fighting crime.</p>
<blockquote> <p><em>NORAH O’DONNELL: The government had accused him of “significant harm to U.S. national security”–</em></p> <p><em>PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: That’s the Biden government.</em></p> <p><em>NORAH O’DONNELL: Okay. Allowing U.S. terrorist groups to, you know, essentially move millions of dollars around. He pled guilty to anti-money laundering laws. That was in 2023. Then in 2025 his crypto exchange, Binance, helped facilitate a $2 billion purchase of World Liberty Financial’s stablecoin. And then you pardoned C.Z. How do you address the appearance of pay for play?</em></p> <p><em>PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, here’s the thing,</em> <strong><em>I know nothing about it because I’m too busy</em></strong> <em>doing the other–</em></p> </blockquote>
<p>Um. Isn’t that exactly why your administration is claiming Biden’s pardons don’t count?</p>
<blockquote> <p><em>NORAH O’DONNELL: But he got a pardon–</em></p> <p><em>PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I can only tell you that–</em></p> <p><em>NORAH O’DONNELL: He got a pardon–</em></p> <p><em>PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Norah, I can only tell you this.</em> <strong><em>My sons are into it</em></strong><em>. I’m glad they are, because it’s probably a great industry, crypto. I think it’s good. You know, they’re running a business, they’re not in government. And they’re good– my one son is a number one bestseller now.</em></p> </blockquote>
<p>So here Trump admits (1) he doesn’t know who CZ is, then (2) admits that basically his sons are the ones into cryptocurrency and “not in government,” and effectively admits that (3) he pardoned CZ on the advice of his sons, who directly profit from the pardon through their cryptocurrency business, while claiming ignorance of the entire arrangement.</p>
<p>This isn’t just yet another example of the most corrupt pay-for-play administration in the history of the United States but one that literally does everything it falsely accuses past administrations of doing, but way worse. Just as they’re claiming that Biden’s pardons weren’t valid, Trump is effectively admitting he has no idea who he’s pardoning, but he’s doing it to help his corrupt sons.</p>
<p>And I won’t even get into the frenzy MAGA continues to go through about Hunter Biden supposedly enriching himself by using his father’s name. Remember all those stories claiming payoffs to the “Biden family”? Funny how those folks are all silent about the Trump family (1) actually doing what they falsely accused Biden of doing and (2) doing it way, way, way worse.</p>
<p>Speaking of crime, another part of the interview involves the President falsely claiming that immigration enforcement is targeting criminals (leaving aside that he keeps pardoning criminals).</p>
<p>When O’Donnell asks about CBP’s tactics in Chicago—tear-gassing residential neighborhoods, smashing car windows—Trump’s response is to call for <em>more</em> violence:</p>
<figure><p class="rw-outer-content"><span>Some content could not be imported from the original document.</span> <a href="https://embed.bsky.app/embed/did:plc:4llrhdclvdlmmynkwsmg5tdc/app.bsky.feed.post/3m4oseq6pbb2t?id=3908821315871577&amp;ref_url=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.techdirt.com%252F2025%252F11%252F03%252F60-minutes-edits-donald-trump-telling-them-60-minutes-should-edit-donald-trump-talking-about-how-60-minutes-paid-him-for-editing-kamala-harris%252F">View content ↗ </a></p></figure>
<p>Again, here’s the unedited transcript:</p>
<blockquote> <p><em>NORAH O’DONNELL: More recently, Americans have been watching videos of ICE tackling a young mother, tear gas being used in a Chicago residential neighborhood, and the smashing of car windows. Have some of these raids gone too far?</em></p> <p><em>PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No. I think they haven’t gone far enough because we’ve been held back by the– by the judges, by the liberal judges that were put in by Biden and by Obama. We’ve been held–</em></p> <p><em>NORAH O’DONNELL: You’re okay with those tactics?</em></p> <p><em>PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yeah, because you have to get the people out. You know, you have to look at the people. Many of them are murderers. Many of them are people that were thrown outta their countries because they were, you know, criminals. Many of them are people from jails and prisons. Many of them are people from frankly mental institutions. I feel badly about that, but they’re released from insane asylums. You know why? Because they’re killers.</em></p> </blockquote>
<p>Note the question: she’s asking him about ICE (actually CBP) tear gassing residential neighborhoods and smashing car windows. And he says “they haven’t gone far enough.” He literally thinks he should be able to have the military attack Americans.</p>
<p>And he’s completely full of shit about targeting “criminals and murderers.” The vast, vast majority of them are not. Over 90% of those being grabbed <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2025/06/26/more-than-90-percent-of-ice-detainees-have-never-been-convicted-of-violent-crimes/">have never been convicted of a violent crime</a>. We already know that Trump’s advisor Stephen Miller has told immigration officials to just grab anyone they can and to ignore any efforts to target actual criminals (because Miller knows there just aren’t that many in reality—it was all a myth they fed Fox News to get Trump elected).</p>
<p>But Trump is so disconnected from reality he doesn’t know that.</p>
<p>And speaking of disconnected from reality: he still thinks migrants “seeking asylum” means they’re literally from mental institutions. He’s been making this claim for years. No one has corrected him. No reporter has asked him to clarify. The President of the United States genuinely appears to believe that foreign governments are emptying psych wards and shipping patients to America because they’re “seeking asylum.”</p>
<p>So let’s recap: in a single interview, the President (1) suggests CBS edit out his complaints about CBS editing while simultaneously claiming CBS’s past editing was corrupt enough to sue over, (2) admits he pardoned someone he’s never met on the advice of unnamed people who are most likely his sons who profit directly from that pardon—the exact scenario his own party claims invalidates Biden’s pardons, and (3) endorses escalating violence against American citizens in residential neighborhoods while lying about who’s being targeted and seemingly unable to comprehend who the violence is actually being used against.</p>
<p>We have a President so catastrophically disconnected from reality that he’ll pardon anyone his sons tell him to, endorse any level of violence his advisors suggest, and contradict himself in the same sentence without noticing. The people around him—his kids, his advisors, his handlers—do the things they’ve spent years accusing others of doing (except way worse), and Trump happily goes along with it because he either doesn’t understand or doesn’t care. They get away with it, and they do it again, more brazenly.</p>
<p>The media that’s supposed to be holding him accountable has instead hired a Trump-approved censor to monitor their coverage and installed an inexperienced right-wing propagandist to run their newsroom. So when Trump sits down for an interview and admits on camera that he’s doing exactly what he’s claiming others should be jailed for… they don’t follow up or ask any tough questions.</p>
<p>They let him tell them what to edit out.</p>
<p>And they do it.</p>
