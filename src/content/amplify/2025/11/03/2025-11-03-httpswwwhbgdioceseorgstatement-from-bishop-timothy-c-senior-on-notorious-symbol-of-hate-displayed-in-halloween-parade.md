  Statement from Bishop Timothy C. Senior on Notorious Symbol of Hate Displayed
  in Halloween Parade
---
<p><strong>HARRISBURG, Pa.</strong> – The Most Reverend Timothy C. Senior, Bishop of Harrisburg, has issued the following statement regarding a notorious symbol of hate that appeared on a float of one of the Diocese’s Catholic schools during a recent community Halloween parade:</p>
<p>“I was shocked and appalled to learn that the Halloween parade float from Saint Joseph Catholic school in Hanover included a replica of the Auschwitz Concentration Camp gate, bearing the words ‘Arbeit Macht Frei.’</p>
<p>“The inclusion of this image—one that represents the horrific suffering and murder of millions of innocent people, including six million Jews during the Holocaust—is profoundly offensive and unacceptable. While the original, approved design for this float did not contain this imagery, it does not change the fact that this highly recognizable symbol of hate was included.</p>
<p>“On behalf of the Diocese of Harrisburg, I express my sincere apology to our Jewish brothers and sisters and to all who were hurt or offended by this display. I strongly condemn the inclusion of this symbol on the float. As Catholics, we stand firmly against all forms of antisemitism, hatred, and prejudice, which are rampant in our society. The Church’s relationship with the Jewish community is one of deep respect, friendship, and shared faith in the one true God.</p>
<p>“We will work with the school community to ensure that this incident becomes an opportunity for education and reflection, and review approval processes so that such a grievous incident is never repeated.</p>
<p>“Let us continue to pray for healing, understanding, and unity among all of God’s people.”</p>
<p>Bishop Senior has pledged to work with the Pennsylvania Jewish Coalition and the Anti-Defamation League to provide information to the local school community on the horrific suffering endured by the Jewish people during the Holocaust, and the continued antisemitism seen throughout our world today.</p>
