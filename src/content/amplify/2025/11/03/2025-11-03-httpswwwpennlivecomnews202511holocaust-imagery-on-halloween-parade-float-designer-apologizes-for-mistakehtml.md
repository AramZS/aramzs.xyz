<p>An Adams County man who designed a <a href="https://www.pennlive.com/news/2025/11/harrisburgs-catholic-bishop-apologizes-for-nazi-imagery-on-halloween-parade-float.html">Halloween parade float featuring imagery from Auschwitz concentration camps</a> admits he made a mistake.</p>
<p>“I had no ill intent,” Galen S. Shelly told PennLive on Saturday. “I made a mistake and I am deeply sorry.”</p>
<p>The float was created for the St. Joseph School and entered in Thursday’s Hanover Halloween Parade.</p>
<p>Shelly, who was the head designer and does not have children enrolled in the school, said he didn’t realize the impact of “Arbeit Macht Frei,” the phrase he selected.</p>
<p>The float depicted what appears to be a look-alike of one of the main gates at the infamous Auschwitz concentration camp with the phrase.</p>
<p>That phrase - which translates literally to “Work Makes You Free” - was commonly posted at World War II-era concentration camps throughout Europe, including Auschwitz, the deadliest of them all.</p>
<p>The school float started raising concerns Friday afternoon on the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/715414578632190">Hanover Area Watch Group Facebook page,</a> where dozens of posters were aghast about the optics - whether accidental or intended.</p>
<p>It also prompted the <a href="https://www.pennlive.com/news/2025/11/harrisburgs-catholic-bishop-apologizes-for-nazi-imagery-on-halloween-parade-float.html">Roman Catholic Diocese of Harrisburg on Friday to issue an apology.</a></p>
<p>Shelly said the phrase was not part of his original design but came about after a lighted archway with lanterns at the top he ordered didn’t ship on time.</p>
<p>At the last minute, he said he built his own version to create a vision of a somber entrance to a cemetery. He said he researched photos of cemeteries online.</p>
<p>“I wanted to illustrate the idea none of us get out of this life alive,” Shelly said. “I never intended anything to be like this. I couldn’t have anticipated it. I made a mistake and I ask everyone’s forgiveness.”</p>
<p>The elaborate float also featured ghosts on a swing set and a rock ‘n’ roll jukebox.</p>
<p>Shelly said he is upset by the repercussions from his mistake and feels badly for the church and school, including the students.</p>
<p>He also said the driver of the float, Metcalf Cleaning LLC in Hanover, is not responsible.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/Metcalffamilycleaning2017">On Saturday, the cleaning company issued a statement on Facebook: </a>“Our company volunteered to pull a float for a local community group; however, we were not involved in the creation of its decorations or messaging.</p>
<p>“At the time, we were unaware of its meaning and significance. We recognize that we should have taken a closer look at the float prior to the parade, and we are truly sorry for that oversight,” they said.</p>
<p>Representatives from the Hanover Jaycees and St. Joseph School didn’t respond when reached for comment.</p>
