<p>It doesn’t take a sophisticated <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/24/politics/fact-check-grocery-prices-trump">fact check</a> to know that grocery prices have been increasing, so it will come as no surprise that prices at US restaurants have been climbing, too.</p>
<p>In September, the median price of the nectar of the gods cold brew coffee rose 4.2% YoY, to $5.49, according to new <a href="https://pos.toasttab.com/blog/data/menu-price-monitor">data</a> from Toast, a restaurant software platform with more than 148,000 locations. Less steep (and less steeped) was the increase for a beer, with the median price rising 2.2% to $6.47.</p>
<p>Moving from drinks, some median restaurant food prices for September to chew on:</p>
<ul><li>Burritos, up 3.2% YoY, to $13.41</li><li>Burgers, up 3.1% YoY, to $14.47</li><li>Wings, up 2.4% YoY, to $13.78</li></ul>
<p>The National Restaurant Association <a href="https://restaurant.org/research-and-media/research/restaurant-economic-insights/economic-indicators/menu-prices/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">reports</a> that US menu prices rose 3.7% YoY in September, slightly less than the 3.9% YoY increase in August.</p>
<p>In a recent <a href="https://www.restaurantdive.com/spons/why-food-costs-are-the-top-challenge-for-restaurants-in-2025/802663/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">survey</a> from restaurant software provider Restaurant365, 91% of restaurant executives reported that their food costs have risen this year, with 13% reporting some of their ingredients have increased by 15% or more. Nearly 80% said they expected tariffs to have an impact on their business this year.</p>
