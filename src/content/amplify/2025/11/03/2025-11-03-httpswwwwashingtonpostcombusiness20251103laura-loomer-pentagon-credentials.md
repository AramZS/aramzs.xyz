(Thomas Simonetti/For The Washington Post)</figcaption></figure><p>Laura Loomer, the far-right political activist and former congressional candidate in Florida, has been credentialed to cover the Defense Department, according to one person familiar with the matter, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/10/22/pentagon-press-corps-right-wing-media/" target="_blank">joining a new cohort</a> of right-wing media that have agreed to the Pentagon’s new press policy.</p><p class="rw-outer-content"><span>Some content could not be imported from the original document.</span> <a href="https://washingtonpost.com/business/2025/11/03/laura-loomer-pentagon-credentials/">View content ↗ </a></p><p>Loomer, 32, has forged a close alliance with President Donald Trump, routinely meeting with the president in the Oval Office during his second term. She has frustrated some in the administration with her proximity to Trump and public criticisms of high-ranking defense and national security officials who she argues are disloyal to Trump — some of whom have been dismissed soon after her rebukes.</p><p class="rw-outer-content"><span>Some content could not be imported from the original document.</span> <a href="https://washingtonpost.com/business/2025/11/03/laura-loomer-pentagon-credentials/">View content ↗ </a></p><p class="rw-outer-content"><span>Some content could not be imported from the original document.</span> <a href="https://washingtonpost.com/business/2025/11/03/laura-loomer-pentagon-credentials/">View content ↗ </a></p><p>Loomer’s addition to the Pentagon’s press corps comes as the department has overhauled its media policies. Journalists covering the Pentagon <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/10/15/reporters-leave-pentagon-en-masse-after-refusing-sign-new-rules/">walked out</a> of the building en masse last month, in response to a<b> </b>new department press policy that prohibited them from soliciting any information not made available by the government.</p><p class="rw-outer-content"><span>Some content could not be imported from the original document.</span> <a href="https://washingtonpost.com/business/2025/11/03/laura-loomer-pentagon-credentials/">View content ↗ </a></p><p>Dozens of news outlets, including The Washington Post, the New York Times, CNN and Fox News, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/10/14/fox-news-among-broadcasters-refusing-sign-pentagon-press-pledge/">refused to sign</a> the policy many called a threat to press freedom. Out of the outlets comprising the day-to-day Pentagon press corps, only One America News, a right-wing cable network, agreed to sign.</p><p class="rw-outer-content"><span>Some content could not be imported from the original document.</span> <a href="https://washingtonpost.com/business/2025/11/03/laura-loomer-pentagon-credentials/">View content ↗ </a></p><p>The Pentagon unveiled a new press corps last month, consisting largely of <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/10/22/pentagon-press-corps-right-wing-media/">far-right media publications</a>, including the Gateway Pundit, The Post Millennial, and LindellTV — MyPillow founder Mike Lindell’s streaming service — along with independent journalists<b> </b>and online influencers. These publications, which have signed or signaled they will sign the agreement, have not previously covered the Pentagon in person on a regular basis.</p><p>Loomer and the Defense Department did not immediately respond to request for comment. The White House declined to comment. </p><p class="rw-outer-content"><span>Some content could not be imported from the original document.</span> <a href="https://washingtonpost.com/business/2025/11/03/laura-loomer-pentagon-credentials/">View content ↗ </a></p><p>Loomer’s social media posts have presaged the firings of several Trump officials, and Loomer has often bragged that she “Loomered” them, using her slang term for such conquests. But some in the administration have suggested she overplays her influence by only offering a preview of actions that were already imminent.</p><p class="rw-outer-content"><span>Some content could not be imported from the original document.</span> <a href="https://washingtonpost.com/business/2025/11/03/laura-loomer-pentagon-credentials/">View content ↗ </a></p><p>Gen. Timothy Haugh was <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/04/03/nsa-director-fired-tim-haugh/" target="_blank">ousted</a> as director of the National Security Agency and head of U.S. Cyber Command in April, shortly after Loomer said she had advocated his dismissal in an Oval Office meeting. “NSA Director Tim Haugh and his deputy Wendy Noble have been disloyal to President Trump,” Loomer said in a post on X. “That is why they have been fired.”</p><p>Loomer attributed Trump’s <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/05/03/waltz-trump-israel/" target="_blank">firing</a> of national security adviser Michael Waltz and multiple members of his staff in April to a “swift response to [her] report." In September, Waltz was <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/09/19/mike-waltz-un-ambassador-trump-signalgate/" target="_blank">confirmed</a> as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations.</p><p class="rw-outer-content"><span>Some content could not be imported from the original document.</span> <a href="https://washingtonpost.com/business/2025/11/03/laura-loomer-pentagon-credentials/">View content ↗ </a></p><p>Loomer hasn’t spared the Pentagon from her vitriol.</p><p>Loomer has railed against Col. Earl G. Matthews, then nominated to serve as the Defense Department’s general counsel, and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/08/09/laura-loomer-florent-groberg-dan-driscoll/">more recently</a> Army Secretary Dan<b> </b>Driscoll.</p><p>She <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/09/laura-loomer-trump-defense-department-00280921">criticized</a> Matthews in April, <a href="https://x.com/LauraLoomer/status/1909752428775588167">posting on X</a> that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth was at risk of being “subverted and obstructed” by Matthews. Loomer criticized Driscoll in August over his decision to praise Medal of Honor recipient Florent Groberg, who was severely injured while saving fellow soldiers from a suicide bomber in Afghanistan, because he spoke at the 2016 Democratic National Convention and was not born in America. Loomer called Groberg is an “anti-Trump leftist.”</p><p class="rw-outer-content"><span>Some content could not be imported from the original document.</span> <a href="https://washingtonpost.com/business/2025/11/03/laura-loomer-pentagon-credentials/">View content ↗ </a></p><p class="rw-outer-content"><span>Some content could not be imported from the original document.</span> <a href="https://washingtonpost.com/business/2025/11/03/laura-loomer-pentagon-credentials/">View content ↗ </a></p><p class="rw-outer-content"><span>Some content could not be imported from the original document.</span> <a href="https://washingtonpost.com/business/2025/11/03/laura-loomer-pentagon-credentials/">View content ↗ </a></p><p>“I’ve served under presidents from both parties and will always honor my oath to this country,” Groberg told The Post at the time. “Yes, I spoke for 60 seconds at the DNC when asked about service and sacrifice, not politics.”</p><p>Driscoll, the Army Secretary, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/09/06/tom-hanks-west-point/" target="_blank">revoked</a> the appointment of Jen Easterly, President Joe Biden’s director of Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency, to the faculty of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point following Loomer’s criticism.</p><p>Loomer, who once <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/far-right-activist-laura-loomer-handcuffs-herself-twitter-s-new-n941891">handcuffed herself</a> to the door of Twitter’s New York City office after the company banned her from the platform, maintains a personal website called Loomered and dubs herself an “investigative journalist, activist, and truth-teller” who has made enemies in Silicon Valley and in the media.</p><p class="rw-outer-content"><span>Some content could not be imported from the original document.</span> <a href="https://washingtonpost.com/business/2025/11/03/laura-loomer-pentagon-credentials/">View content ↗ </a></p><p>Loomer has built her semi-celebrity status online largely through feats of viral attention. Since 2017, when she was banned from Uber and Lyft for an <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/power/2024/05/02/laura-loomer-donald-trump/">online rant</a> about “Islamic immigrant” drivers, she has styled herself as a free-speech warrior whom online platforms have unfairly mistreated and undermined.</p><p>She’s <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/power/2024/05/02/laura-loomer-donald-trump/">called herself</a> “anti-Islam” and has referred to immigrants of all kinds as “invaders.” She has been thwarted for jobs in Trump’s orbit — on the campaign trail and in the White House — on “four separate occasions,” she previously said in an <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/08/05/loomer-trump-influence/">interview with The Post</a>, saying that various Trump White House staffers and advisers have “contempt” for her.</p><p class="rw-outer-content"><span>Some content could not be imported from the original document.</span> <a href="https://washingtonpost.com/business/2025/11/03/laura-loomer-pentagon-credentials/">View content ↗ </a></p><p>Still, she’s managed to remain a close unofficial adviser to the president.</p><p class="rw-outer-content"><span>Some content could not be imported from the original document.</span> <a href="https://washingtonpost.com/business/2025/11/03/laura-loomer-pentagon-credentials/">View content ↗ </a></p><p>“I know she’s known as a ‘radical right,’ but I think Laura Loomer is a very nice person,” Trump told reporters in August. “… I think she’s a patriot, and she gets excited because of the fact she’s a patriot, and she doesn’t like things going on that she thinks are bad for the country. I like her.”</p><p>Loomer has criticized Trump sparingly, including around his acceptance of a jet from the Qatari royal family. Though <a href="https://x.com/LauraLoomer/status/1921615017138618439" target="_blank">she said</a> he had accepted a “‘gift’ from jihadists in suits,” she later apologized to Trump for the comment.</p><p>Loomer applied for a press pass to cover the White House and has considered moving from Florida to Washington. But she <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/08/05/loomer-trump-influence/">told</a> The Washington Post earlier this year that her application for White House credentials had been stalled, despite her repeated requests for approval and the fact that other right-wing influencers with smaller audiences had already been granted access.</p><p class="rw-outer-content"><span>Some content could not be imported from the original document.</span> <a href="https://washingtonpost.com/business/2025/11/03/laura-loomer-pentagon-credentials/">View content ↗ </a></p><p>Loomer, who previously contributed to the conservative sting-operation group Project Veritas, also compiles and sells opposition research as part of Loomered Strategies, a consulting firm she has <a href="https://x.com/LauraLoomer/status/1904212335398432809">promoted</a> as “your opponent’s worst nightmare.”</p><p class="rw-outer-content"><span>Some content could not be imported from the original document.</span> <a href="https://washingtonpost.com/business/2025/11/03/laura-loomer-pentagon-credentials/">View content ↗ </a></p><p>But Loomer’s presence could also frustrate Pentagon officials, some of whom scrambled to contain the fallout from viral comments she made attacking Hegseth last month.</p><p>After Hegseth announced that the U.S. would host a Qatari air force training facility at a base in Idaho, Loomer said the decision was so disturbing that she would not be voting in next year’s midterm elections. In an <a href="https://x.com/LauraLoomer/status/1976668333539021140">X post</a> viewed more than 2 million times, she said Republicans had given “terror financing Muslims from Qatar a MILITARY BASE on US soil so they can murder Americans.”</p></body></html>
