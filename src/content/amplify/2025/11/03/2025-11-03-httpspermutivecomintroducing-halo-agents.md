<h2><b>Meet Halo: Permutive’s New Agentic Suite that Infinitely Scales Direct Buying</b></h2>
<p>The old limitations of advertising are breaking the revenue model for publishers. For years, fragmentation held the Open Internet back, stopping it from achieving the performance and scale of the walled gardens. As the industry shifts to outcomes, we have to accelerate the building of a sustainable ecosystem, where publishers and advertisers can collaborate directly and effectively.</p>
<p>That’s why we’re excited to announce Halo, Permutive’s new agentic suite built to drive revenue growth by enabling – for the first time – direct buying to scale infinitely across publishers and campaigns. Now leveraged across hundreds of millions of dollars in spend, customers are already using it to win more RFPs and better optimize for performance and outcomes.</p>
<p>Halo sell-side agents are built to transform how teams operate. They turn data collaboration into a living, learning system that predicts, automates, and scales into outcomes across the Open Internet, fostering a better ecosystem for all players. These agents are live in Permutive’s platform today, running across the campaign lifecycle: audience management, planning, optimization, and soon, reporting.</p>
<p>The promise of AI is a better advertising ecosystem: a world where agents enable direct buying to scale infinitely across campaigns. That means more native ad formats, powered by sell side signals and optimized with an understanding of context and audience.</p>
<p>Halo delivers on that promise.</p>
<p>“AI agents mark a profound shift for how media buying scales on the Open Internet. We’ve spent the last 18 months building agents with our clients across hundreds of millions of dollars in ad spend, and Halo marks the culmination of that collaboration,” said Joe Root, CEO &amp; Co-founder, Permutive. “We can now finally mitigate the inherent fragmentation of the Open Internet and scale infinite direct buying for our customers.”</p>
<h2><b>How it Works</b></h2>
<p>Halo doesn’t just analyze your data – it acts on it. Built on Permutive’s predictive infrastructure, our agents learn from performance, suggest optimizations, and even execute tasks from audience management to outcome reporting, all while keeping your first-party data secure and compliant.</p>
