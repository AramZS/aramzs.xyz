<p>In his latest quest to fix something far from broken, racist billionaire lunatic <a data-link="native" href="https://www.sfgate.com/streaming/article/alien-earth-elon-musk-sucks-20888757.php">Elon Musk</a> decided to unleash his own optimized version of Wikipedia, predictably named Grokipedia, onto the world this week. Now if, like Musk’s own children, you’re not a member of the Elon fan club, you can probably imagine why Musk took on this project. Here’s a man who <a data-link="native" href="https://www.sfgate.com/local/article/elon-musk-claim-for-buying-twitter-sf-mind-virus-18462172.php">purchased Twitter a few years ago</a> specifically to refashion it into a neo-Nazi disinformation machine (check), insinuated himself with the second Trump administration so that he could <a data-link="native" href="https://www.sfgate.com/tech/article/elon-musk-bay-area-roots-doge-20202692.php">hollow out the federal government</a> (check), and designed electric cars that <a data-link="native" href="https://www.sfgate.com/sf-culture/article/Tesla-is-just-another-car-company-and-Elon-Musk-16299141.php">spontaneously combust</a>, burning their liberal owners to death (check). There is nothing this man cannot make cheaper, wonkier and 20% more Hitler-y.</p>
<p>I know because I took Grokipedia for a test drive this week. (And be forewarned that this column contains racist language and copious slurs.)</p>
<p>Speaking of Hitler, let’s see what Grokipedia <a data-link="native" href="https://grokipedia.com/page/Adolf_Hitler">has to say</a> about history’s greatest villain. Hitler’s entry on Grokipedia includes a “Debates and Intent on Functionality” section, which is absent in Wiki’s entry on the man. Let’s see what this bonus section has to say (emphasis below mine)!</p>
<p>“The historiographical debate on the intent and functionality of Nazi racial policies, particularly the Holocaust, centers on whether the systematic extermination of Jews was the fulfillment of Adolf Hitler’s premeditated master plan <strong>or the unintended outcome of bureaucratic radicalization and wartime improvisation</strong>.”</p>
<p>You already know about people who deny that the Holocaust ever happened, so kudos to Grokipedia for introducing, “The Holocaust was real, but also it was just a happy accident!” as a new means of discrediting Jewish history.</p>
<p>Who wrote this passage on Grokipedia? Ah well, I had to go to <a data-link="native" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grokipedia">Wikipedia</a> to figure that out. Turns out, <a data-link="native" href="https://apnews.com/article/elon-musk-wikipedia-grok-grokipedia-4dab7c6ebb16cc7718b231adae4aac95">no one knows</a> the answer to that. A cited link to the Associated Press in Wiki’s entry on Groki <a data-link="native" href="https://apnews.com/article/elon-musk-wikipedia-grok-grokipedia-4dab7c6ebb16cc7718b231adae4aac95">reports</a> that Musk’s site uses an ambiguous mix of crowdsourcing and its owner’s proprietary AI software — which he already appended to Twitter/X to <a data-link="native" href="https://www.npr.org/2025/07/09/nx-s1-5462609/grok-elon-musk-antisemitic-racist-content">predictably virulent results</a> — to compose its more than 850,000 entries. I never would have sorted this without Wikipedia, so thanks, Wiki!</p>
<p>Because, in a time when nearly all valuable online products are being co-opted and <a data-link="native" href="http://www.google.com">degraded</a> by their respective owners, Wikipedia remains true to its origins. It was founded in 2001 as a nonprofit internet reference manual that was to be fully crowdsourced. In the ensuing decades, it has swelled to over 7 million English entries and become an indispensable resource to both laypeople and journalists alike. Every entry on Wikipedia is written and edited by human contributors, and every citation either links to credible background sources, or the entry includes an italics <em>citation needed</em> to indicate when more vetting is required. Edits that don’t pass the smell test are either disregarded or flagged. And every change to an entry is visibly logged, so that the public can see how the entry evolved over the years into its current form. You can also see the fights that editors and contributors have had over changes, which provides a great deal of fun on its own. Best of all, Wikipedia remains a nonprofit to this day, which keeps its motives relatively pure in a world beset on all sides by bad faith.</p>
<p>Elon Musk is perhaps, second to Donald Trump, our greatest disseminator of bad faith. So it makes sense that he would cobble together a half-assed competitor to Wikipedia that is motivated by profit, and by his own demented worldview. Grokipedia exists strictly as a reactionary product, and that was plainly evident when I took the site for a test drive. Its user interface is bare. I had to maximize my browser window just for the sidebar on any entry to appear. It also provides no means for logged in users (I created an account with the name F—k You) to make their own contributions, nor to dispute citations. To putz around on Grokipedia is to read through Musk’s attempt to rewrite the bulk of history to suit his own ends. That’s why, when I tried to search for a “Grokipedia” entry <em>on</em> Grokipedia, I found no entry at all.</p>
<p>More like WOKE-ipedia. Am I right, fellow plantation owners?! Huh? Anyway, if you think these suggested results make sense, then you’re on <a data-link="native" href="https://www.sfgate.com/tech/article/elon-musk-don-lemon-interview-ketamine-19207532.php">more ketamine than Musk himself</a>.</p>
<p>There’s more. When I looked up Elonpedia’s entry for “Slavery in the United States,” I found this section of reeducation:</p>
<p>“<strong>Black and Mulatto Slaveholders: </strong>Free blacks and mulattos in the antebellum United States owned slaves, primarily in southern states such as South Carolina, Louisiana, Virginia, and Maryland, where free colored populations were more established.”</p>
<p>That section runs four paragraphs long. Wikipedia’s notes on minority slaveholders in America is just one paragraph. If you know Elon Musk, you know that extra padding wasn’t put in there for the sake of further enlightenment. Furthermore, Wikipedia’s entry on the same subject only uses the now-established slurs “mulatto” and “colored” in quotations or formal titles. But <a data-link="native" href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1586104694421659648">comedy is still legal</a> on Grokipedia, so Elon’s slurbot is free to denigrate Black and mixed race folks any way it pleases. Or it ignores denigration of those people entirely; there is no Grokipedia entry for the N-word.</p>
<p>So, while snooping around on Musk’s site, I got the feeling that his pet project tweaked the hot button entries <a data-link="native" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/2025/10/grokipedia-elon-musk/684730/">to tilt MAGA</a>, and then just stole content for all of the normal s—t. That assumption proved to be essentially correct. In addition to using dated slurs in its entry on <em>human enslavement</em>, Grokipedia un-optimizes plenty of other matters of historical import. Here it is on Trump’s refusal to concede the 2020 election, emphasis again mine:</p>
<p>“Trump refused to concede, citing voting anomalies including unsecured drop boxes, unsigned ballots, and changes to state election laws without legislative approval, filing over 60 lawsuits; <strong>while most were dismissed on procedural grounds, post-election audits lent partial credence to concerns</strong>.”</p>
<p>And here’s its entry on George Floyd, famously murdered by Minneapolis cop Derek Chauvin that same year:</p>
<p>And what about Musk himself? How does the man’s new history machine portray him? Well, here’s how Wikipedia framed Musk’s acquisition of Twitter two years ago:</p>
<p>“His acquisition of Twitter was controversial due to a subsequent <a data-link="native" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_under_Elon_Musk#Increase_in_hate_speech">increase in hate speech</a> and the <a data-link="native" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_under_Elon_Musk#Handling_of_misinformation_and_disinformation">spread of misinformation</a> on the service. His role in the <a data-link="native" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Trump_administration">second Trump administration</a> attracted <a data-link="native" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protests_against_Elon_Musk">considerable public backlash</a>, particularly in <a data-link="native" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_to_the_Department_of_Government_Efficiency">response to DOGE</a>.”</p>
<p>Compare that with Grokipedia’s portrayal of the same story (emphasis mine again):</p>
<p>“Policy updates [to X] relaxed proactive misinformation labeling—previously applied selectively—but strengthened rules on child sexual exploitation, while adopting a ‘freedom of speech, not freedom of reach’ model to limit amplification of violative content without outright removal. These reforms correlated with advertiser withdrawals totaling over $75 million in lost revenue by late 2022, attributed by Musk to ‘activist’ boycotts rather than content surges, though reports noted <strong>temporary </strong>rises in hate speech visibility before algorithmic adjustments. Musk maintained that prior moderation’s left-leaning institutional biases, evident in leaked ‘Twitter Files’ documents revealing FBI influence on content decisions, justified the pivot toward transparency and minimal intervention. By 2024, X hired select safety roles amid ongoing refinements, balancing free expression with legal compliance.”</p>
<p>This is the whitewashing machine at work. There’s nothing written up on Grokipedia that Wikipedia hasn’t written up more accurately, and in a more user-friendly manner. Meanwhile, I looked up Alice In Chains (I’ve been on a big Alice run lately) on both <a data-link="native" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_in_Chains">Wiki</a> and <a data-link="native" href="https://grokipedia.com/page/Alice_in_Chains">Groki</a> and was greeted with two completely identical paragraphs on the band’s early years.</p>
<p>While the big political entries drive traffic, apolitical entries are really the bread and butter of Wikipedia. I have friends who spend their downtime just checking out random entries over there, and I follow the <a data-link="native" href="https://bsky.app/profile/depthsofwikipedia.bsky.social">Depths of Wikipedia account</a> that highlights some of Wiki’s more curious entries, such as “<a data-link="native" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_(goat)">Charlie (goat)</a>.” These are fun little holes to burrow down into. You can burn time off the clock AND bone up on serious dad facts while perusing them. That’s the point of Wikipedia: to educate you, even on the stupid stuff. That’s why it’s such a valuable resource for students, educators, fanboys, journalists and people of every other stripe.</p>
<p>By contrast, Grokipedia — which falsely touts itself as an “open source, comprehensive collection of all knowledge” — has no Charlie the goat entry. It has no “<a data-link="native" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random">Special: Random</a>” function that allows you to shuffle through tidbits you’d never think to seek out on your own. It has no real purpose other than to strategically plant lies into a reference manual. This renders it not only a malevolent product, but a lousy one. But hey, maybe Elon didn’t mean for his baby to be such a piece of s—t. Maybe it was just the unintended outcome of bureaucratic radicalization and wartime improvisation.</p>
