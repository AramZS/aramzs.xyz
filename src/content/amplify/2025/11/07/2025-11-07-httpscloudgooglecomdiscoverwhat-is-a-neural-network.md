<div><div data-is-cws-richtext="true" jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md" jscontroller="M0Q3Qb"><p>Deep learning is a powerful technique within machine learning that utilizes neural networks with multiple layers. These deeper networks excel at identifying intricate patterns within vast datasets, revolutionizing areas such as image and language processing.</p><p><br/></p><p>For example, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/discover/what-is-deep-learning" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">deep learning</a> enables self-driving cars to detect objects on the road, empowers language models to generate human-like text, fuels recommendation systems that suggest personalized content, and aids in medical diagnoses through image analysis.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>The key distinction between traditional neural networks and deep learning lies in their depth, with deep learning networks incorporating far more layers. This increased depth allows them to tackle complex problems and process vast amounts of data that would overwhelm simpler networks.</p></div></div>
