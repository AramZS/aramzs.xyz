title: PiKVM - Open and inexpensive DIY IP-KVM on Raspberry Pi
---
<table> <tbody><tr> <td>A very simple and fully functional Raspberry Pi-based <b>KVM over IP</b> that <b>you can make with your own hands</b> without any soldering! <br/><br/> This device helps to manage servers or workstations remotely, regardless of the health of the operating system or whether one is installed. You can fix any problem, configure the BIOS, and even reinstall the OS using the virtual CD-ROM or Flash Drive. <br/><br/> <b>It only costs between $30 and $100</b> for DIY depending on the features desired. Even the most expensive configuration will be cheaper than a $500 commercial IP-KVM. </td> <td><figure><a href="https://pikvm.org/img/kvm-main.jpg"><img src="https://pikvm.org/img/kvm-main.jpg"/></a></figure></td> </tr> </tbody></table>

<h2>Fully-featured and modern IP-KVM</h2>
<ul> <li><b>Easy to build</b><br/>A ready-to-use OS images and friendly build environment. The hardware can be made in half an hour and without soldering. </li> <li><b>Very low video latency</b><br/>~100 milliseconds of video latency. This is the smallest delay of all existing solutions. </li> <li><b>Extra lightweight Web UI and VNC</b><br/> No weird proprietary clients. No ugly applets. Just use your favorite browser to connect to the PiKVM. No flash plugins either! Ah, and VNC is also supported. </li> <li><b>Keyboard &amp; mouse</b><br/>Mouse usage works directly in the browser. The keyboard emulator supports displaying the state of the keyboard LEDs. </li> <li><b>Mass Storage Drive</b><br/> On the Raspberry Pi 4 and ZeroW, PiKVM can emulate a virtual CD-ROM or Flash Drive. A live image can be uploaded to boot the attached server. </li> <li><b>ATX power management</b><br/> With a very simple circuit that can be assembled on a breadboard, the power button of the attached server can be controlled using the ATX button headers on the motherboard. </li> <li><b>Security</b><br/> PiKVM can be opened to the Internet and no one will get access without the authorization. SSL is used to protect traffic from being intercepted by third parties. </li> <li><b>Local monitoring</b><br/> PiKVM monitors the health of the Raspberry Pi board and will warn you if it's too hot or is not receiving enough power. </li> <li><b>GPIO management</b><br/> You can control GPIO and USB relays via the web interface. The extensible interface allows you to make anything out of it. </li> </ul>
<h2>Production-ready</h2>
<ul> <li><b>Linux-based embedded OS</b><br/> The PiKVM OS is based on <a href="https://archlinuxarm.org">Arch Linux ARM</a> and can be customized for any needs. Thousands of pre-built binary packages are at your service and can be updated with a single command! </li> <li><b>Read-only filesystem</b><br/> By default the OS runs in read-only mode, as an embedded system should. This prevents damage to the memory card due to a sudden power outage. </li> <li><b>VNC server</b><br/>The managed server and its BIOS can be accessed using a regular VNC client which supports JPEG compression. </li> <li><b>IPMI BMC/SoL and Redfish</b><br/>Use <i>ipmitool</i>, <i>ipmiutil</i> or any existing network infrastructure that supports IPMI to manage the server's power and access to serial port via LAN. Redfish and <i>redfishtool</i> supported too. </li> <li><b>Wake-on-LAN</b><br/>PiKVM can be configured to power up a managed server using WoL. This will be available in the Web menu. </li> <li><b>Extensible authorization methods</b><br/> Multiple PiKVMs can be configured to use a common authorization service. PAM and its rich authorization mechanisms can also be used to integrate PiKVM into your existing authentication infrastructure. </li> <li><b>Macro scripts</b><br/> If repetitive actions must be performed on the attached server (or on several different servers), a macro can be recorded with keyboard &amp; mouse actions and can be played back multiple times. </li> </ul>
<h2>Open Source</h2>
<ul> <li><b>Community &amp; support</b><br/>PiKVM has a large community. Join the <a href="https://discord.gg/bpmXfz5">Discord chat</a> if you have any questions. </li> <li><b>Extensible</b><br/>PiKVM was designed as a set of microservices with a plug-in architecture. It's very easy to modify and maintain. </li> <li><b>Comprehensive API</b><br/>Everything that can be done via the user interface can also be done via a powerful HTTP API. </li> <li><b>Know-how</b><br/>We created our very own <a href="https://github.com/pikvm/ustreamer">MJPG video server</a> written in C with multi-threading support and GPU video encoding - the fastest streaming solution available to provide the best video quality for PiKVM. We also tested a lot of hardware configurations so that you can be sure devices you assemble will work reliably. </li> </ul>
