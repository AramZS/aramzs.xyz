title: 'The Billionaires Who Failed to Stop Zohran Mamdani, and How Much They Spent'
---
<p><a href="https://time.com/7308924/zohran-mamdani-interview-time/">Zohran Mamdani </a>defeated a Republican, a fellow Democrat, and an army of billionaires when he emerged victorious in the New York City mayoral election on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Mamdani, a self-described democratic socialist, will be the first Muslim to ever hold the position, and the youngest mayor in over a century.</p>
<p>More than 2 million New Yorkers voted in the closely watched race, making it the largest turnout for a mayoral race in more than 50 years. With around 90% of ballots counted on Wednesday morning, Mamdani had won just over 50% of the votes cast.</p>
<p>The 34-year-old campaigned during a time of rising financial insecurity on making the city more affordable for most of the city’s residents through <a href="https://time.com/7299525/zohran-mamdani-new-york-city-housing-crisis-plan/">rent freezes</a>, free buses and universal childcare. To pay for those policies, he promised a modest tax increase for New York City’s millionaires and a rise in the corporate tax rate.</p>

<p>Spooked by the prospect of paying slightly higher taxes, and by his often-repeated belief that billionaires <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/VowT8L8Uu6k?t=0">shouldn’t exist</a>, more than 20 billionaires pulled out their checkbooks to stop Mamdani from becoming mayor of the United States’ most populous city, beginning during the Democratic primary campaign, when he faced former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo for the first time.</p>
<p>Most of the money was poured into three main super PACs, both pro-Cuomo and anti-Mamdani. <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/new-york-playbook/2025/05/13/cuomos-very-very-super-pac-00343806">Fix the City</a>, the PAC supporting Cuomo’s bid since the primary, spent millions on television ads for the former mayor and against Mamdani. Anti-Mamdani PACs Defend NYC—started by former advisor to President Donald Trump, Jason Meister—and For Our City, have also taken in giant sums from billionaire donors like former mayor Michael Bloomberg and hedge fund manager Bill Ackman.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>During his campaign, Mamdani often remarked on the huge amounts of money being spent to defeat him.</p>
<p>“They’re spending more money than I would even tax them,” he said in an interview with MSNBC last week.</p>

<p>He also agreed with the billionaires that his agenda posed a threat to their power.</p>
<p>"Billionaires like Bill Ackman and Ronald Lauder have poured millions of dollars into this race because they say that we pose an existential threat," Mamdani said at an Oct. 13 rally. "And I am here to admit something. They are right. We are an existential threat to billionaires who think their money can buy our democracy.”</p>
<p>Here are some of the billionaires who tried to thwart Mamdani’s campaign.</p>

<p>Bloomberg, former three-term mayor of New York City and cofounder of Bloomberg L.P., now reportedly <a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/michael-bloomberg/">worth</a> over $100 billion, gave <a href="https://www.nyccfb.info/FTMSearch/IndependentSpenders/Contributions?ec=2025&amp;rt=ind&amp;ir=Bloomberg%2C%20Michael%20R">$5 million</a> to Cuomo’s Fix the City in the final month of the campaign, adding on top of more than $8 million in support of Cuomo during the Democratic primary.</p>
<p>Bloomberg and Mamdani met for the first time in September, a meeting that Howard Wolfson, a political adviser to Bloomberg, told the New York <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/11/nyregion/mamdani-bloomberg-mayor.html"><em>Times</em></a> was “definitely cordial” and “substantive.”</p>

<p>Still, Bloomberg <a href="https://x.com/MikeBloomberg/status/1983658192283316676">reaffirmed</a> his endorsement of Cuomo in late October.</p>

<p>Joe Gebbia, a cofounder of Airbnb, has spent a total of <a href="https://www.nyccfb.info/FTMSearch/IndependentSpenders/Contributions?ec=2025&amp;rt=ind&amp;ir=Gebbia%2C%20Joseph">$2 million</a> on the race, including $1 million apiece to Fix the City and Defend NYC.</p>
<p>Gebbia is the Chief Design Officer for President Donald Trump, who endorsed Cuomo in the final days of the election. He is worth around <a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/joe-gebbia/">7.7 billion</a>.</p>
<p>On Oct. 20, Gebbia <a href="https://x.com/jgebbia/status/1980265177187500261">posted to X</a> that Sliwa could “still be the hero,” urging him to drop out to help Cuomo win—a narrative many centrist Democrats and Republicans pushed in an attempt to stop Mamdani’s win.</p>

<p>Hedge fund investor Ackman has been one of the most outspoken billionaires to come out against Mamdani. He had donated $1 million to Defend NYC and <a href="http://nyccfb.info/ftmsearch/IndependentSpenders/Contributions?ec=2025&amp;rt=ind&amp;indId=Z193">another</a> $750,000 to Fix the City between April and October 2025.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Ackman, who is worth over $8 billion according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/profiles/william-a-ackman/">Bloomberg</a>, regularly commented on the mayoral race on social media, sharing Cuomo’s posts, New York <em>Post</em> articles calling Mamdani a “commie,” and commentary urging Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa to drop out.</p>
<p>“Mamdani is not the right mayor because he is a socialist with no experience running anything,” Ackman said on X.</p>
<p>Mamdani <a href="https://x.com/ZohranKMamdani/status/1978537723813048609">mocked</a> Ackman on numerous occasions for his “1,000-word tweets” railing against his campaign.</p>
