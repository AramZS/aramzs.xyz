What you write on BlueSky, you say to the world. What we give ourselves, collectively, by wondering and complaining and epiphanizing in public, is a dataset of how we are. <br/> <br/>How are we? <br/> <br/>You can find out for yourself. You can find out without any help from me, of course, but since I'm currently on a <a href="https://imbue.com">professional mission</a> to catalyze human agency by making explicable software for participatory intelligence, I'm experimenting with offering particularly geeky forms of help for various things, and this is one of them. <br/> <br/>My particular bit of BlueSky help is called <a href="https://furia.com/skyq/skyq.html">SkyQ</a>. It provides a simple way to sample some messages from the real-time BlueSky feed, a <a href="https://dactal.org">DACTAL</a> query interface for exploring them, and a few BlueSky-specific DACTAL extensions so that you can navigate among the AT Protocol data structures: DIDs, handles, follows, posts, threads. I have deliberately not given this web app much mechanism beyond this, because I'm not trying to make any assumptions about what <i>your</i> curiosity might involve. <br/> <br/>But as an <i>example</i> of how this curiosity might work, I've provided a query for calculating word-frequency from any set of BlueSky messages, and I've also gone ahead and used the tools myself to pre-build a baseline dataset of <b>word frequencies</b> so that you can score <i>your</i> word frequencies against everybody else's. <br/> <br/>Here's how to get started. <br/> <br/>- Go to <a href="https://furia.com/skyq/skyq.html">SkyQ</a>. There are no accounts or logins* or anything, because this is all public source-data. Anything you do in SkyQ gets saved in your browser's local storage, so your questions are totally private unless you choose to post about them somewhere else. <br/> <br/>- Go to the "#" box at the top and put in 1000 (or whatever), and then hit "Collect" to grab some messages from the live BlueSky feed. You can also put something in the "sample BlueSky feed for" to get only messages that mention that text, but start with nothing just to see how it works. <br/> <br/>- Once you have some messages, click "word frequency" under "analysis queries". Here's what this query consists of: <br/> <br/>??message count=(messages....count) <br/>?messages/(.commit.record.text....words.):count&gt;=5 <br/>|freq=(.(.name.word frequencies.frequency);(0)),score=(.[=count/(freq+1)]) <br/>:(:freq&gt;0;count&gt;=(message count.[=_/1000])),count&gt;=(message count.[=_/400]) <br/>#score <br/> <br/>In English this means: <br/> <br/>- count the messages you've sampled (we'll need this later in the query) <br/>- take those sampled messages and group them by unique words (welcome to the weird internals of the AT Protocol: each message technically represents a <i>commit</i>, which has a <i>record</i> which has a <i>text</i> field) <br/>- keep the word-groups with at least 5 messages <br/>- annotate them with a "freq" value looked up in the reference dataset <br/>- calculate a very basic "score" for each word by dividing your sample count by the reference count <br/>- keep the word-groups for words that appear at least .1% of the time if they are in the reference list, or at least .25% of the time if they aren't (math...) <br/>- sort them by score <br/> <br/>Doing this with an unfiltered sample of 10000 messages on the morning of 2025-09-16 got me this: <br/> <br/><figure><img src="https://furia.com/log/images/log0518.01.png"/></figure> <br/> <br/>RIP Robert Redford. That explains the first three. Did Chuck Mangione die, too? Yes, but two months ago. Why are people talking about him again today? You can click any link in the <i>of</i> column to see the messages that mentioned that word. You can click column headers in any of these tables to navigate into subproperties, so with a list of messages, clicking <i>commit</i> then <i>record</i> then <i>text</i> will get you to the actual contents the same way the query did it. (And oh, right: today's Mangione news is not about Chuck.) <br/> <br/>What do the rest of these mean? I don't know. I didn't check, and the point of this is to get <i>you</i> to try. If any of them are still on the list when you do, you can learn something for yourself. And if you do, I hope you'll post about it, both because SkyQ doesn't monitor your actions in any way but I'd still love to know people are trying this, and because that's how we collect collective knowledge. <br/> <br/>(Or, sometimes, that's how break our new experimental tools. If <i>that</i> happens to you, let me know. I'm <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/glennmcdonald.bsky.social">on there</a>, too.) <br/> <br/> <br/>[*2025-10-07 update: You can now <i>optionally</i> login when using this, and thus call BlueSky APIs requiring authentication, like the search API to get <i>existing</i> posts about something instead of just scanning the live feed for them. I also added some more analysis queries, including a few basic ones about <i>topics</i> that use <i>.matching posts</i>.] <br/> <br/><br/> <br/>/did/(.of.commit.record.text....allwords.)<br/> <br/> <br/>is much less noisy than <br/> <br/>/(.commmit.record.text....allwords.)<br/> <br/> <br/>]  </td> </tr></tbody></table>
