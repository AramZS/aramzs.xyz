<h2>I will not give up that which I have tasted</h2>
<p><em>by Zack Budryk</em></p>
<p>I got my autism diagnosis when I was 14 years old. Back then we still believed a lot of things about the condition that no longer apply. To start, I was diagnosed with Asperger’s syndrome, which was folded into a generalized autism spectrum disorder diagnosis years later. It was also several years before a fabricated study by grotesque, <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1925209/?ref=welcometohellworld.com"><u>vampiric</u></a> fraud Andrew Wakefield linking childhood MMR vaccines to autism was <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nm0310-248b?ref=welcometohellworld.com"><u>formally retracted</u></a> by The Lancet.</p>
<p>In the current era of crank negative polarization, where the highest-profile proponents of the tired old canard are Donald Trump and Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr., it can be hard to picture a world where more traditionally mainstream figures gave the vaccine myth credence. And yet two years after my diagnosis, Rolling Stone and Salon <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110501040223/http://www.salon.com/letters/corrections/2005/index.html"><u>platformed the idea</u></a>, as did presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama <a href="https://prospect.org/2008/04/22/three-candidates-spoken-link-vaccines-autism/?ref=welcometohellworld.com"><u>on the 2008 campaign trail</u></a>. By the time Wakefield’s fraudulent research was retracted in 2010, it had reeled in a number of devotees who never left, from Trump to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/bill-maher-real-time-vaccines-cause-autism-anti-vaxxer-2019-11?ref=welcometohellworld.com"><u>Bill Maher</u></a> to a current <a href="https://people.com/celebrity/jenny-mccarthy-opens-up-about-her-son-with-autism/?ref=welcometohellworld.com"><u>panelist </u></a>on what was once the most popular show on US TV.</p>
<p>Most of this washed over me at the time. I was, after all, a hormonal teenage boy, so to the extent that I perceived myself as different I attributed it alternately to me being smarter than everyone else or dumber than everyone else. Nothing sounds more absurd to a high school-aged boy than the notion that someday he will better understand his place in the world, that he will be less irritated and confused all the time. But it did happen, largely because I fell in love a year or two into adulthood. My spouse and I have been married 13 years, but the relationship could easily have failed to clear the launchpad. We were set up by mutual friends, and she later admitted that early in our relationship she wasn’t sure what to make of my affect, or my sense of humor and tendency to ramble. Despite it all, she gave me a chance, one I was not entitled to but for which I remain indescribably grateful. In the next few years we would move in together, get married and build careers and lives in ways my mother once privately confided she had feared I would never be able to do.</p>
