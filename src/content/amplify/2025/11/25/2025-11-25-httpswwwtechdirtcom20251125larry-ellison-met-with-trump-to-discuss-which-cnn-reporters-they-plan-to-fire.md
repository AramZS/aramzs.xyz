<h3>from the <i>if-you-can't-beat-'em,-buy-'em</i> dept</h3>
<p>Trump’s right wing billionaire friend Larry Ellison (and his nepobaby son, David) recently <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2025/09/09/with-looming-cbs-hire-of-bari-weiss-two-of-the-four-major-u-s-networks-will-now-be-right-wing-propaganda-mills/">acquired CBS</a> and likely <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2025/09/17/tiktok-to-be-sold-to-trumps-right-wing-billionaire-buddies-and-converted-into-a-propaganda-mill/">co-ownership of TikTok</a>. Like Elon Musk’s acquisition of Twitter, the goal isn’t really subtle: rich, thin-skinned right wingers want to own the entirety of U.S. new and old media, then convert it into a giant propaganda and lazy infotainment bullhorn that <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2025/09/09/with-looming-cbs-hire-of-bari-weiss-two-of-the-four-major-u-s-networks-will-now-be-right-wing-propaganda-mills/">blows smoke up their asses</a>.</p>
<p>The Ellisons have since set their sights on Warner Brothers, CNN, and HBO. It won’t be cheap; it’s estimated that Larry and company will have to pay <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2025/10/28/king-trump-makes-it-clear-he-wants-his-bff-larry-ellison-to-own-warner-brothers/">upwards of <strong>$60 billion</strong> for the acquisition</a>. The Trump administration has <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2025/10/28/king-trump-makes-it-clear-he-wants-his-bff-larry-ellison-to-own-warner-brothers/">openly signaled that they’d very much like the Ellisons to succeed here</a>, in part to force a dying cable news channel (CNN) to be even friendlier to Trump than it already is.</p>
<p>While Ellison has some competing suitors with names like <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2025/11/05/comcast-netflix-and-cbs-will-all-now-kiss-trumps-ass-to-try-and-acquire-warner-brothers-and-cnn/">Comcast NBC Universal and Netflix</a>, the winning bidder will need approval from the Trump DOJ and FCC. Knowing that they likely have a distinct tactical advantage via corruption, Ellison and Trump appear to be already measuring the drapes, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/20/warner-bros-discovery-takeover-paramount-skydance-larry-ellison">discussing programming changes</a> (and CNN hirings and firings) that will please the president:</p>
<blockquote> <p><em>“Ellison often speaks to connections at the White House and in at least one phone call engaged in a dialogue about possibly axing some of the CNN hosts whom <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> is said to loathe, including Erin Burnett and Brianna Keilar, the people said.”</em></p> </blockquote>
<p>You might recall that during the first Trump administration, Trump tried very hard to offload Time Warner (and CNN) to Rupert Murdoch, who <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/11/is-rupert-murdoch-a-hidden-hand-in-the-cnn-merger-meltdown?srsltid=AfmBOorVyoAraES2K6Ne_IbX28yWfod2xn3qoOOiuLY4-Cs35YUrYAUP">worked behind the scenes to scuttle the AT&amp;T Time Warner deal</a>. Trump has <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2025/11/20/trumps-own-judges-easily-reject-his-bonkers-lawsuit-against-cnn-for-calling-his-big-lie-a-big-lie/">repeatedly filed unsuccessful lawsuits against CNN</a> trying to silence critical voices at the network. With those gambits having failed, buying and destroying CNN from the inside is the next step.</p>
<p>The great irony is these networks that offend Trump <em>weren’t exactly what you’d call bastions of hard-nosed journalism to begin with</em>. Under the ownership of Trump fan David Zaslav, CNN is already know for flinging softball questions at Trump authoritarians, failing to challenge obvious lies on air, and generally airing a sort of safe, infotainment-centered pseudo-journalism.</p>
<p>But even <strong>that’s</strong> too much critical thinking for America’s thinnest skinned billionaires.</p>
<p>Ellison is already hard at work turning <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2025/09/09/with-looming-cbs-hire-of-bari-weiss-two-of-the-four-major-u-s-networks-will-now-be-right-wing-propaganda-mills/">whatever was left of CNN into a right wing propaganda mill</a>. If he acquires ownership of TikTok and CNN as well; the <strong>potential</strong> exists to create a propaganda empire that’s arguably <strong>larger and much worse</strong> than Fox News.</p>
<p>But given the recent failures of efforts to dominate U.S. media through consolidation (again, see AT&amp;T) it’s also equally likely that this weird assortment of <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2025/09/09/with-looming-cbs-hire-of-bari-weiss-two-of-the-four-major-u-s-networks-will-now-be-right-wing-propaganda-mills/">trolls</a> and nepobabies simply creates a mountain of unsustainable debt and hubris crushed by the weight of its own incompetent ambition.</p>
