<p>Children in Chicago’s Old Irving Park neighbourhood were preparing for a Halloween parade on Oct. 25 when federal agents <a href="https://apnews.com/article/chicago-immigration-trump-crackdown-school-children-c9a19835cac13c0fbbebcc9f4bf4f0a2">reportedly deployed</a> tear gas on the street to disperse protesters opposing immigration-related arrests in the neighbourhood.</p>
<p>“Those kids were tear gassed on their way to celebrate Halloween in their local school parking lot,” US District Judge Sara Ellis said in court on Tuesday, according to a <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/chicago/news/border-patrol-gregory-bovino-chicago-tear-gas-judge-sara-ellis/">CBS News</a> report. “I can only imagine how terrified they were”.</p>

<p>Ellis was questioning US Customs and Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino over this and other incidents that protesters allege violate a <a href="https://protectdemocracy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/25-12173-Chicago-Headline-Club-v.-Noem-Final-TRO-Order.pdf">temporary restraining order (TRO)</a> she issued earlier this month.</p>
<p>The Oct. 9 TRO was issued after a group of journalists, faith leaders and protesters filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration over what they described as a “<a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/71559589/1/chicago-headline-club-v-noem/">pattern of extreme brutality</a>” by federal agents against peaceful protesters since <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/news/2025/10/03/secretary-noem-travels-chicago-operation-midway-blitz-reaches-more-1000-illegal">Operation Midway Blitz</a> – a multi-agency operation against “criminal illegal aliens” in Illinois – began on Sept. 2.</p>

<p>When Judge Ellis asked Bovino to produce all use-of-force reports since Sept. 2 from agents involved in Operation Midway Blitz by the end of Tuesday, Bovino said it <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/judge-orders-border-patrol-official-bovino-to-meet-with-her-daily-on-chicago-immigration-crackdown">would be impossible</a> because of the “sheer amount”. Ellis then ordered Bovino to turn over these reports, along with the accompanying body camera footage, <a href="https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/judge-demands-border-patrol-appear-daily-provide-use-of-force-reports/3844774/">by the end of Friday</a>, Oct. 31.</p>
<p>The court order places restrictions on federal agents’ crowd-control measures within the state, including their use of “riot control weapons” such as tear gas and pepper spray, the use of force against individuals and requiring people to leave public spaces that they lawfully have the right to be in.</p>
<p>A subsequent court filing on Oct. 27 alleges that federal agents have violated the TRO “<a href="https://news.wttw.com/sites/default/files/article/file-attachments/TearGasBan.pdf">almost every day</a>” since it was issued. “Immigration enforcement does not typically require the daily use of tear gas on civilians in residential areas,” the filing stated.</p>
<p>Bellingcat’s analysis of social media videos from 28 events in Illinois from Oct. 9 to Oct. 27 found multiple examples of force and riot control weapons being used.</p>
<p>In total, we found seven that appeared to show the use of riot control weapons when there was seemingly no apparent immediate threat by protesters and no audible warnings given. Nineteen showed use of force, such as tackling people to the ground when they were not visibly resisting. Another seven showed agents ordering or threatening people to leave public places. Some of the events identified showed incidents that appeared to fall into more than one of these categories.</p>

<p>It is important to note that the full context of an incident may be unclear from videos on social media alone. Bystanders often only begin filming when an arrest is already ongoing, for example, which can make it difficult to determine what happened in the moments before force was applied. Each of the events included in our dataset were verified to have taken place in Illinois in recent weeks with at least two sources – videos taken by different people, local reporting or statements from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).</p>
<p>The DHS – which oversees Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) as well as the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) – has justified the use of force or riot control weapons by saying that protesters were threatening or attacking agents.</p>
<p>Bellingcat asked DHS whether it had any response to the TRO or allegations that agents had violated the TRO. As of publication, DHS has not responded to multiple requests for comment.</p>
<p>The TRO does say that riot control weapons or force may be deployed in circumstances such as where there is an “immediate threat” of physical harm to the agents or others, multiple warnings have been given, or where “necessary and proportional” for an arrest. We did not include videos where it was obvious that such conditions had been met.</p>
<p>Despite the limitations, videos taken by eyewitnesses are often the only evidence of such incidents, which may not be reported by media or may have concluded by the time journalists reach the scene.</p>
<h2>Riot Control Weapons</h2>
<p>In our analysis, we found videos showing the use of riot control weapons such as tear gas, pepper spray and other less-lethal weapons in seven events where protesters appeared to be posing no visible threat in the footage, and where no audible warnings appeared to be given.</p>
<p>Among its provisions, the TRO prohibits the use of these types of weapons on people “who are not posing an immediate threat to the safety of a law enforcement officer or others” and also in cases where using them on intended targets would result in injury to those who aren’t posing any threat.</p>

Bovino and DHS have said that he <a href="https://news.wttw.com/2025/10/28/border-patrol-chief-greg-bovino-who-fired-tear-gas-little-village-crowd-set-face-federal">was hit on the head</a> by objects thrown by protesters before he threw the tear gas canister.</p>

<p>DHS <a href="https://bcat-archive.ams3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/no-dups/c3d5e14f8e5d5e306d4a98b7/688769ca1d454141be34e3a1.html">posted a video on Facebook</a>, claiming that it was evidence that “the use of chemical munitions was conducted in full accordance with CBP policy and was necessary to ensure the safety of both law enforcement and the public”.</p>
<p>The video showed a rock skidding on the ground behind Bovino, but did not show the moment that it allegedly hit the Border Patrol chief on the head. A protester who filmed the encounter has also <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/border-patrols-bovino-called-court-accused-throwing-tear-gas-canister-rcna239609">reportedly disputed</a> that Bovino was hit.</p>
<p>At the same protests, another agent allegedly shot a <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ilnd.487571/gov.uscourts.ilnd.487571.94.0.pdf">protester in the neck</a> at close range with <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/publication/st-less-lethal-technologies-law-enforcement">less-lethal ammunition</a>.</p>

<p>Tear gas was also deployed on Oct. 12 in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDEzNn-my3I">Albany Park</a>, Oct. 14 in the <a href="https://bcat-archive.ams3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/no-dups/fd6377c75da3c7a559fa6e3b/f2c04f68972e4f7197ae6269.html">East Side of Chicago</a>, Oct. 24 in <a href="https://bcat-archive.ams3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/no-dups/8796d07886e98720e7cf9d16/349d8a5a331c4e87a022bedd.html">Lakeview</a> and Oct. 25 in <a href="https://bcat-archive.ams3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/no-dups/1e3b6bf5a1857386d2d066b1/e7e29b8d3c9647ad88d30b64.html">Avondale</a>. Bellingcat reviewed footage of each of these incidents and could not see threats to the agents’ safety in the videos before tear gas was deployed, or that audible warnings were issued within the footage.</p>
<p>Videos we reviewed also showed other types of riot-control weapons mentioned in the TRO. Another <a href="https://bcat-archive.ams3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/no-dups/58b0a6d5d06c342de4fb77fa/40a41947d19842c58844f84f.html">video</a> from the Oct. 23 protests in Little Village, posted by a protester named Enrique Bahena, shows an agent shooting a less-lethal projectile directly at the person filming. An <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ilnd.487571/gov.uscourts.ilnd.487571.94.0.pdf">Oct. 26 court filing</a> said Bahena was shot in the “neck from five feet away with a pepper ball”.</p>
<p>Bellingcat’s analysis of the video, which appears to be the same one shown in screengrabs in <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ilnd.487571/gov.uscourts.ilnd.487571.94.0.pdf">the court filing</a>, found that the video in fact shows the agent deploying a <a href="https://bt-usa.com/products/gl06/">B&amp;T GL-06</a> 40mm launcher, which can be used to launch <a href="https://armsunlimited.com/bt-gl06-40mm-less-lethal-launcher/?srsltid=AfmBOorJafyJGKOMLDpzIE_NJ8dy-tmxLfSFx4KD7H6nl_5gBb6Wg8zz">chemical irritant rounds</a> such as the one visible in the video.</p>

<p>Bahena said in <a href="https://blockclubchicago.org/2025/10/24/border-patrol-boss-bovino-tear-gasses-chicago-crowd-violating-judges-order-lawyers-say/">an interview</a> with local outlet Chicago Block Club that agents did not give warnings before they shot him “in the throat” and threw gas canisters at the group of protesters who were shouting at them to leave. He also said in the interview that protesters did throw objects at agents, but that this was after agents had already used force.</p>
<p>B&amp;T <a href="https://cmcgov.com/wp-content/uploads/BT-SIR-BT-23510-Safe-Impact-Round.pdf">technical specifications</a> for their 40mm projectiles state that “shots to the head, neck, spine, or heart are to be avoided unless lethal force is justified”, and advise users to aim at the waistline.</p>
<p>A DHS <a href="https://www.oig.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/assets/2021-04/OIG-21-31-Mar21.pdf#page=17">Office of Inspector General Report</a> in 2021 states that “ICE’s use of force policy indicates that the 40MM launcher is deadly force when fired at someone, while the CBP use of force policy only directs officers not to target a person’s head or neck”. During this same event in Little Village, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL1XcQTdFKk">videos</a> <a href="https://bcat-archive.ams3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/no-dups/840324b4ee1a083eb5657e7d/6bb2f7386b834a148db25c05.html">show</a> other officers appearing to fire less-lethal weapons towards protestors.</p>

<p>The TRO restricts the use of Compressed Air Launchers or Munitions Launchers such as 40mm launchers to strike a person, including on the neck, unless they pose an “immediate threat of causing serious bodily injury or death”.</p>
<p>In another incident on Oct. 22, an agent appeared to quickly roll down a window and spray what appeared to be a chemical irritant at protesters who were confronting federal officers near a Sam’s Club store in the Cicero neighbourhood of Chicago.</p>
<p>The incident was captured in two <a href="https://www.facebook.com/eddieguillen27/videos/731272013330217">separate</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hersh.mosqueda/videos/1105348788349079/">livestreams</a>, which show a few protesters near an unmarked dark grey Chevrolet Tahoe with no front licence plate. One of the protesters taps on the window of the vehicle. Someone then rolls down the window and sprays what appears to be a liquid very quickly before rolling the window back up as the car leaves the scene. One of the people filming said in the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/eddieguillen27/videos/731272013330217">post for the livestream</a> that this was pepper spray, although Bellingcat was unable to verify this.</p>

<p>DHS did not respond to Bellingcat’s questions about whether it believed that the use of riot-control weapons – including during the Oct. 23 Little Village protests – was justified based on the terms of the TRO.</p>
<h2>Use of Force</h2>
<p>Bellingcat also reviewed multiple videos of agents using force in arrests that appeared to be related to Operation Midway Blitz, and identified those where the force shown being used looked potentially excessive and the person being arrested did not appear to pose an “immediate threat of physical harm to others” – a requirement in the TRO for using force such as tackling or shoving someone to the ground.</p>
<p>On Oct. 10, a day after the TRO was issued, an ICE agent was <a href="https://bcat-archive.ams3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/no-dups/8558aab5a20df5d3aed940a6/d1c882ca015d4cdf9a9b7e98.html">seen dragging a teenage</a> girl out of a car in Chicago’s Hoffman Estates and tackling her to the ground while she shouted “I’m not resisting”. The teenager, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/chicago/news/teen-tossed-to-ground-by-ice/">reportedly an 18-year-old US citizen</a>, was handcuffed and an officer appeared to put a knee on her back. DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said <a href="https://x.com/TriciaOhio/status/1977378998071038129">in a post</a> that the incident was a “burglary” arrest from 2024 which did not involve ICE – although this has been <a href="https://newrepublic.com/post/201748/department-homeland-security-lying-ice-arrest-video">debunked</a> by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DP2ByLcE1Kh/">multiple news outlets</a>.</p>
<p>Bellingcat asked DHS about this specific incident and why McLaughlin’s post remains up on X despite multiple news outlets verifying that the incident took place this month in Hoffman Estates, but did not receive a response.</p>

<p>This was not the only case where DHS’ version of events appears to contradict video footage of the incident posted on social media.</p>
<p>On Oct. 22, a woman <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/news/2025/10/24/cicero-or-sicario-day-crashes">identified by DHS as Isabel Mata</a> was arrested by Border Patrol agents in Little Village. A video of the incident shows multiple agents tackling her while one of them has his knee on her back to hold her to the ground. DHS stated Mata “threatened a law enforcement officer after stating she would put a hit out on Chief Gregory Bovino”. Bellingcat reviewed <a href="https://bcat-archive.ams3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/no-dups/072469fbd315b94cd184b30e/73e7146b2d8e4b4694dcb39a.html">a video that showed</a> the minutes before Mata was tackled by agents but did not hear any threat being made, even though Mata appeared to have been standing near the person filming. DHS did not respond to Bellingcat’s questions about this incident.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0euW_3vqKZw">Another video</a> from Oct. 10 appears to show agents colliding with a car on Hubbard Street and dragging the driver out by her legs. The woman, identified as Dayanne Figueroa, told <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/us-citizen-dragged-car-border-patrol-chicago-10924948">Newsweek</a> that she was on her way to get coffee before work and “instead of handling the situation as a routine traffic incident”, masked armed agents forcibly removed her without questions or informing that she was under arrest.</p>
<p>DHS reportedly told Newsweek that Border Patrol was making a targeted arrest when Figueroa’s vehicle blocked agents and struck an unmarked government vehicle. They also said she “violently resisted” and was arrested for assault on a federal agent.</p>
<p>The video shows agents arresting someone, before one of their vehicles swerves into another lane and appears to hit Figueroa’s car. Multiple bystanders can be heard shouting that <a href="https://bcat-archive.ams3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/no-dups/91bd3da14b1d15ec8bcee807/ed6aaefaca2a46a4b6276bf8.html">the agents hit Figueroa’s car first</a> and that they were <a href="https://bcat-archive.ams3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/no-dups/ecc56e46ee8438161b1d8a0a/dc47ff42d2de433eb3f4efe5.html">making a U-turn</a> in the middle of the street.</p>

<p>Bellingcat asked DHS about the conditions under which it would consider the use of force – such as tackling or shoving people to the ground – proportionate and necessary, but did not receive a response.</p>
<h2>Dispersal Orders</h2>
<p>The TRO prohibits federal agents from “issuing a crowd dispersal order requiring any person to leave a public place that they lawfully have a right to be, unless dispersal is justified by exigent circumstances as defined by Department of Homeland Security Use of Force Policy”.</p>
<p>Bellingcat has asked DHS about when agents are justified in telling people to get off the streets, or people in cars to stop following them, and whether there are any laws preventing people from following or filming federal agents from a distance. As of publication, we have not received a response.</p>
<p>However, we found several examples of agents telling people to leave public places when they did not appear to be impeding arrests in video footage.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://bcat-archive.ams3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/no-dups/aa25bc31861f151cd174f94f/723fa616d0bf4db8b6261be0.html">a video</a> recorded in Chicago’s Arlington Heights on Oct. 24, a masked man with a rifle tells someone filming to “get the f*** across the street” and “get back to your car”. The person filming is shouting that agents have assaulted a woman and slapped her phone out of her hands, and the video appears to show a woman in a scuffle with another masked agent, apparently over a phone. A <a href="https://bcat-archive.ams3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/no-dups/d79bfad72497d1d67ddbaa38/bc3bba7fd85342e5b017c762.html">separate video</a> from the same location and date shows agents arresting a man who is on the ground.</p>

<p>In some of these cases, agents appear to be pointing non-lethal weapons at civilians while ordering them to leave public spaces. A <a href="https://bcat-archive.ams3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/no-dups/b21cfa368b5bb5b08264633d/978eb87b6ac8452e97562821.html">video</a> from Oct. 16 shows agents telling protesters to “get out of the street”, pointing pepper spray at them and threatening them with arrest in Chicago’s Evanston neighbourhood.</p>

<p>A similar incident took place in Rolling Meadows on Oct. 19 when an officer was pictured <a href="https://bcat-archive.ams3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/no-dups/f6dff79bdb4748606c273ccc/70580f19516c42cd9ea1a792.html">pointing a pepper ball gun</a> from a moving vehicle at a person filming him in a parking lot. A federal judge <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/28/us/chicago-protestors-tear-gas-gregory-bovino">reportedly said</a> the incident was “troubling” and has called for answers.</p>
<p>On Oct. 20, in Berwyn, an agent <a href="https://bcat-archive.ams3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/no-dups/5488f977bac7c994f8276ab4/8e8b23f303aa4cdf86342ea7.html">pointed a gun</a> at a woman who said she was pregnant. By the woman’s account, the agents were chasing after two people and the video shows her honking to alert those nearby. A DHS agent told <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/ice-agent-pregnant-woman-firearm-illinois-10922067">Newsweek</a> that the agent “acted to protect his life and safety of others around him and showed great restraint”.</p>

<p>DHS did not respond to Bellingcat’s questions about the circumstances under which its agents were justified in telling people to get off the streets or people in cars to stop following them.</p>
<p>Judge Ellis’ TRO is set to expire on Nov. 6. There is a scheduled hearing the day prior, Nov. 5, to determine if the TRO should be converted into a preliminary injunction.</p>
