title: How reducers work
---
<p>At work, we have a livestream show called Rubber Duck Thursdays where we talk about open source and code each week. It’s really fun and you can find it on GitHub’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@GitHub">YouTube</a>, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/github">Twitch</a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/github/">LinkedIn</a> channels.</p>
<p>This past week, on the stream someone in the comments mentioning they didn’t know how reducers worked, so I took the liberty of writing up an example!</p>
<p>Here’s the video, and <a href="https://gist.github.com/cassidoo/f3e5a01815a647b23183ffe5c7021aa3">here’s the resulting code if you want to just skip to that</a>.</p>

<p>Hope this was helpful for you!</p>
