<p>Welcome back to another edition of the Baekdal/Plus newsletter. Today we are going to talk about the use of AIs in the newsroom, and I have put together a 28-page guide to help.</p>
<p>As a media analyst, I come across examples of newsrooms using AI several times per week. On one hand, this is good because it means that newsrooms are experimenting and innovating, but so many of these examples are exceptionally bad.</p>
<p>There are two main reasons why they are bad. The first reason is a deep misunderstanding about what AI is and what it can do, particularly when it comes to generative AIs. The second reason is that their use of AIs is for entirely the wrong reasons.</p>
<p>In this guide, I’m going to go through all of this. Both what you can and should use AIs for, but also what you shouldn’t.</p>
<p>Let’s start with the overall strategic focus.</p>
<p><i>(Quick note: This article only focused on the newsroom. There are many other ways to use AI, including personalization, subscription optimization, etc. but that’s a different topic).</i></p>
<h2>Overall strategy goal</h2>
<p>The first big problem that I have seen is that many publishers don’t zoom out enough when it comes to their use of AI. What I mean is that so much of what I see lacks an overall strategic focus that takes their future outlook into account.</p>
<p>Let me quickly explain what I mean by this.</p>
<p>When we look at where things are now heading there are three dominating changes happening. The first one is that the era of social media is now firmly over. What I mean is that, as publishers, social media is no longer a source of cheap low-intent traffic at scale.</p>
