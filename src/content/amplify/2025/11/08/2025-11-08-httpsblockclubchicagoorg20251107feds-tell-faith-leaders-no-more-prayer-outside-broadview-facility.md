<p>BROADVIEW – Federal authorities told demonstrators Friday that there would be “no more prayer” in front of or inside the Broadview ICE facility, in a move that mystified local leaders and raised legal questions.</p>
<p>A federal representative delivered the news to a huddle of faith leaders and activists standing outside the Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility Friday, speaking after faith leaders were denied entry to the building for the third time Friday.</p>
<p>Broadview Police Chief Thomas Mills, whose department helped facilitate the phone call, said that he was “trying to figure out” in discussions with Mayor Katrina Thompson and an attorney if a federal agency could legally ban religious gatherings on land owned by the village. Religious groups previously have been allowed to practice outside the facility, he said.</p>
<p>“I’m just a messenger,” an anonymous voice stuttered over the phone to a huddle of faith leaders and activists standing outside the Broadview immigration processing facility on Friday.</p>
<p>During the call, which took place with a Block Club reporter present, the anonymous representative, told a group of faith leaders and activists that “There is no more prayer in front of building or inside the building because this is the state and it’s not [of a] religious background.”</p>
<p>“I’m dumbfounded,” the police chief told Block Club. “Every time I talk with [federal officials], it feels like their rules keep changing. We don’t really know what’s happening, I’m sorry I can’t say more. We just want to keep people safe and let them peacefully protest without getting hurt.”</p>
<p>Protesters expressed concern that the direction from federal officials could be in violation of the First Amendment, which guarantees both freedom of religion and assembly. The move also comes days after <a data-wpel-link="external" href="https://apnews.com/article/vatican-pope-migrants-us-441229638a27420cad3de1e07f73a494">the AP reported</a> that Pope Leo XIV urged authorities to allow pastoral workers to be able to access detained migrants.</p>
<p>The call followed an 11:30 a.m. interfaith service in the free speech zone near the facility at 1930 Beach St., that called on federal immigration officials to let faith leaders into the building to provide interfaith services to detainees. Although it was not explicitly stated, it appears that future services like Friday’s would fall under the ban.</p>
<p>Friday’s try was the third time such an entry was attempted, and the third time it was denied. Organizers weren’t allowed to deliver a letter requesting entry to the building between 11:30 a.m. and 12:30 p.m. Friday.</p>
<p>“Members of our religious delegation have served in a pastoral and ministerial capacity in jails, prisons and detention centers for many years, and are more than willing to provide pastoral care to those who desire it inside of the ICE facility in Broadview,” the letter read. “We are willing to meet with a member of your staff today to discuss the logistics of our visit … inside of the Broadview ICE facility.”</p>
<p>In past weeks, local and state law enforcement successfully delivered letters from the faith leaders to officials inside the building, but Friday was the first time that did not occur, Mills said.</p>
<p>Friday’s “Faith over Fear” rally featured prayers and speeches from groups including Indigenous Americans, Catholics, Jews, Muslims and Unitarians. The Faith over Fear rally will be held on the first Friday of every month from November forward, organizers said.</p>

<p>Father Michael Pfleger, the prominent activist and pastor of St. Sabina Church, 1210 W. 78th Pl., spoke out against ongoing federal immigration raids in Chicago under Operation Midway Blitz. More than 3,000 people have been arrested in Chicago so far, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem <a data-wpel-link="internal" href="https://blockclubchicago.org/2025/10/30/feds-wont-pause-immigration-blitz-during-halloween-dia-de-los-muertos-homeland-security-boss-says/">said late last month</a>.</p>
<p>“We’re here today not simply out of protest or demonstration, but because our faith does not allow us to remain silent while war has been declared on the men, women and the children of our city,” Pfleger said. “This administration of an incompetent, narcissistic, wannabe dictator has chosen to invoke fear, pain and terror on the city of Chicago and its citizens.”</p>
<p>Pfleger said that Trump and his “galactic empire” “have, in the name of safety, been the very purveyors of violence.”</p>
<p>Roughly 100 demonstrators gathered in the free speech zone with colorful signs and costumes while being penned in by concrete barriers. The religious processions were entirely peaceful, with no arrests and minimal interaction between protesters and law enforcement.</p>
<p>Separately, 14 people were <a data-wpel-link="external" href="https://abc7chicago.com/post/ice-chicago-news-sheriffs-deputies-remove-group-suburban-moms-broadview-protest-today-immigration-enforcement/18126098/">arrested </a>in an act of civil disobedience outside the Broadview facility earlier in the day. And the Tribune <a data-wpel-link="external" href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/2025/11/07/broadview-ice-lawsuit-updates/">reported</a> Friday that U.S. Magistrate Judge Laura McNally plans to visit the Broadview center for an inspection to vet the government’s assertions that it is complying with an order mandating sufficient food, water, bed space and attorney access be provided to detainees.</p>
<p>Last Saturday, Illinois State Police <a data-wpel-link="internal" href="https://blockclubchicago.org/2025/11/02/faith-leaders-again-denied-entry-to-broadview-ice-facility-hold-mass-outside-anyway/">shot pepper balls at protesters and arrested four </a>people at a costumed demonstration protesting conditions in the facility.</p>
<p>In the month of September, federal agents progressively ramped up force against protesters by deploying chemical weapons and shooting less-lethal projectiles at crowds of civilians and journalists. But since Oct. 3, protesters have largely confronted a “Unified Command” made up of the Broadview Police Department, Cook County Sheriff’s Office and Illinois State Police.</p>
<p>Over 70 protesters have been arrested by state and local forces since the Unified Command that established “free speech zones” for protesters to assemble.</p>
