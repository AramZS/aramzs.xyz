<p>Fannie Mae watchdogs who were removed from their jobs had been probing if Trump appointee Bill Pulte had improperly obtained mortgage records of key Democratic officials, including New York Attorney General Letitia James, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>Fannie’s ethics and investigations group had received internal complaints alleging senior officials had improperly directed staff to access the mortgage documents of James and others, according to the people. The Fannie investigators were probing to find out who had made the orders, whether Pulte had the authority to seek the documents and whether or not they had followed proper procedure, the people said.</p>
<div>That group elevated the probe about the James documents to the more senior Office of Inspector General for the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the agency that oversees Fannie Mae and   <a data-type="company" href="https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/FMCC">Freddie Mac</a> and that Pulte heads, the people said. The acting inspector general then passed the report to the U.S. attorney’s office in eastern Virginia, some of the people said. </div><p></p>
<p>That office, under the leadership of a Trump-appointed interim U.S. attorney, Lindsey Halligan, had brought a criminal case alleging mortgage fraud against James. A spokesperson for the U.S. attorney’s office hasn’t responded to a request for comment.</p>
<div>James has called the charges baseless and rooted in President   <a data-type="person" href="https://www.wsj.com/topics/person/donald-trump">Trump</a>’s desire for revenge. She   <a data-type="link" href="https://www.wsj.com/us-news/law/letitia-james-pleads-not-guilty-in-mortgage-fraud-case-38ec26d2?&amp;mod=article_inline">pleaded not guilty</a> last month during a brief court proceeding in Norfolk, Va. The FHFA acting inspector general sent the office the report at least in part because it could be considered material information for James’s defense in the case, one of the people said. </div><p></p>
<div>In the wake of the probes, and other investigations inside Fannie, about a dozen members of the ethics and internal investigations unit of Fannie   <a data-type="link" href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trump-administration-fires-fannie-mae-ethics-officials-88a0684a?mod=article_inline">were fired</a>, The Wall Street Journal has reported. Suzanne Libby, Fannie Mae’s chief ethics officer, was removed and Danielle McCoy, who served as general counsel, also stepped down after being pressured by leadership, the Journal reported. </div><p></p>
<p>The FHFA’s acting inspector general, Joe Allen, who sent the internal investigation to the prosecutors, was asked to step down from his role shortly after, the people said.</p>
<p>Pulte has pointed to diversity, equity and inclusion as a reason for layoffs at the company. Around the time of the departures, Pulte and Fannie leaders had grown tired of investigations they viewed as being too tailored toward allegations related to DEI, the Journal reported.</p>
<p>In response to a request for comment, a spokesman for the FHFA said: “The anonymous sources in this story are attempting to obstruct the criminal justice system by completely fabricating false and defamatory claims.” The spokesman declined to elaborate which claims the statement referred to.</p>
<p>Libby and McCoy didn’t return requests for comment. A spokesperson for the FHFA’s Office of Inspector General didn’t respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>Since being installed at the top of the FHFA, normally a sleepy administration post out of the spotlight, Pulte has been investigating alleged mortgage fraud, including against some of Trump’s political opponents.</p>
<p>He is also the chairman of the boards of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which backstop a huge chunk of the nation’s mortgages.</p>
<p>Pulte had said in a Bloomberg interview earlier this year that he has used tips and public records in the mortgage investigations.</p>
<div>Pulte has also made criminal referrals against Sen. Adam Schiff, (D., Calif.) and Federal Reserve governor   <a data-type="link" href="https://www.wsj.com/us-news/law/supreme-court-lisa-cook-update-9f954366?mod=article_inline">Lisa Cook</a>. Neither has been charged with a crime. </div><p></p>
<p>Preet Bharara, a lawyer representing Schiff, has called the mortgage fraud allegations “transparently false, stale, and long debunked.” In court filings defending her job at the Fed, Cook has denied committing mortgage fraud.</p>
<p>The Trump administration is considering an initial public offering for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, one of the biggest IPOs in history at a crucial moment for the mortgage market. That process will require convincing potential investors, and the broader mortgage-bond market, the management of the companies is stable.</p>
