  Court rules that OpenAI violated German copyright law; orders it to pay
  damages
---
<p>A German court ruled that OpenAI’s ChatGPT violated the nation’s copyright laws by training its language models on licensed musical works without permission, multiple news outlets, including <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/nov/11/chatgpt-violated-copyright-laws-german-court-rules">The Guardian, reported.</a></p>
<p>The ruling stemmed from a lawsuit that GEMA, a German collective that manages music rights in Germany, filed last November against OpenAI. The company was ordered to pay an undisclosed amount in damages to GEMA but said it disagreed with the ruling and was “considering next steps.” GEMA, meanwhile, regarded this as the “first landmark AI ruling in Europe.”</p>
<p>“Today, we have set a precedent that protects and clarifies the rights of authors: even operators of AI tools such as ChatGPT must comply with copyright law,” GEMA chief executive Tobias Holzmüller said, as The Guardian reported. “Today, we have successfully defended the livelihoods of music creators.”</p>
<p>OpenAI is being sued by other <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/03/studio-ghibli-and-other-japanese-publishers-want-openai-to-stop-training-on-their-work/">creatives and media groups</a> over the same issue.</p>
