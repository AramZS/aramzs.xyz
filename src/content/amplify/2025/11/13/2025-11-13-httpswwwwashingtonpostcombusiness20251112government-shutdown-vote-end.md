title: Government shutdown may end with House vote - The Washington Post
---
<p>The measure is expected to narrowly pass in the GOP-controlled chamber.</p>
<p>The House will return to Washington on Wednesday to vote on a bill to end the longest shutdown in U.S. history.</p>
<p>House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-Louisiana) has kept the chamber out of session since Sept. 19 in an attempt to pressure the Senate to agree to a GOP funding extension, which Senate Democrats repeatedly rejected for weeks.</p>
