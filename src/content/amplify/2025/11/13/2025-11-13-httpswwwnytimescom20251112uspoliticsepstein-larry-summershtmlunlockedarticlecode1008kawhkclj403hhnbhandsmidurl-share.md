<p>Jeffrey Epstein and Lawrence H. Summers, the former Treasury secretary, corresponded regularly, with Mr. Epstein at times offering advice about Mr. Summers’s relationship with a woman, emails released on Wednesday show.</p>
<p>The correspondence, which took place in 2017, 2018 and 2019, suggests a far cozier and more intimate relationship between the two men than was previously known. The emails, some sent multiple times a day, were released by House Republicans along with more than 20,000 pages of documents.</p>
<p>President Trump was a frequent topic. Mr. Epstein described him in December 2018 as “borderline insane.” But many of the emails centered on Mr. Summers’s conversations and interactions with a woman living in London.</p>
<p>In some exchanges, Mr. Epstein referred to Mr. Summers’s interactions with her as though they were a sport.</p>
<p>In a March 16, 2019, email, Mr. Summers appeared concerned about the woman’s involvement with another person.</p>
<p>“I said what are you up to. She said ‘I’m busy,’” Mr. Summers wrote to Mr. Epstein. “I said awfully coy u are.”</p>

<p>“And then I said. Did u really rearrange the weekend we were going to be together because guy number 3 was coming”</p>
<p>Minutes later, Mr. Epstein replied: “shes smart. making you pay for past errors. ignore the daddy im going to go out with the motorcycle guy, you reacted well.. annoyed shows caring., no whining showed strentgh.”</p>
<p>The newly released conversations between the two men took place years after Mr. Epstein pleaded guilty in 2008 to prostitution-related charges. Many of the exchanges occurred after an investigation by The Miami Herald about a secret plea deal, bringing Mr. Epstein back into the spotlight.</p>
<p>Mr. Summers, who served as Treasury secretary during the Clinton administration, declined to comment on Wednesday beyond referring to previous remarks in which he acknowledged “regretting my past associations with Mr. Epstein.” (Mr. Summers is a contributing writer for The New York Times Opinion section.) He was the president of Harvard University from 2001 to 2006.</p>
<p>In November 2018, Mr. Summers forwarded Mr. Epstein an email from a woman whom the former Treasury secretary had corresponded with: “Think no response for a while probably appropriate.”</p>
<p>“She’s already begining to sound needy :) nice,” Mr. Epstein replied.</p>
<p>Mr. Summers’s relationship with Mr. Epstein was previously known. In 2023, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/jeffrey-epstein-documents-woody-allen-larry-summers-edb3e9b2?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqcBvGd6UZ-ZU2H6dScmzHumLYvnVo8axp7TZcsKJuSQAU-IJjB67jwApCTJ5AQ%3D&amp;gaa_ts=6914eee9&amp;gaa_sig=ydJ17P4UM-c9jmzwK7QQW9QzllIirRdrg2nm5cQP8SJ_KhlBH9z7rTg0R_WThb6F7JZPICcAeCM67AVmzFKYaw%3D%3D">The Wall Street Journal reported on an exchange</a> in 2014 between the two men related to Mr. Summers’s wife, Elisa New, a Harvard professor. The Journal, citing emails, reported that Mr. Summers had asked Mr. Epstein for advice on getting $1 million in funding for a project his wife was undertaking.</p>
