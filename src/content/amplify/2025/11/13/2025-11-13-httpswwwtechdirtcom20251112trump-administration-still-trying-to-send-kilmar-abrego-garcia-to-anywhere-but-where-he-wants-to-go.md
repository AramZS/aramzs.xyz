  Trump Administration Still Trying To Send Kilmar Abrego Garcia To Anywhere But
  Where He Wants To Go

<h3>from the <i>millions-of-dollars-worth-of-vengeance</i> dept</h3>
<p>For all its talk about trimming down government spending, an untold amount of money has been blown just to keep one person from getting one over on the Trump administration.</p>
<p>That man would be <a data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/tag/abrego-garcia/" data-type="link" href="https://www.techdirt.com/tag/abrego-garcia/">Kilmar Abrego Garcia</a>. He became the poster boy for the regime’s bigotry when he fought back against his sudden deportation to El Salvador’s most infamous prison.</p>
<p>Abrego Garcia is Salvadoran. He fled that country and sought asylum in the United States. There were reasons he didn’t want to be sent back there. Not that the Trump administration cared. It just wanted him out and was willing to send him to a torture prison run by a self-admitted dictator. The administration made a lot of questionable claims about Garcia’s supposed MS-13 gang activity to justify flying him out <a data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2025/07/03/kilmar-abrego-garcia-details-how-cecot-is-a-torture-camp/" data-type="link" href="https://www.techdirt.com/2025/07/03/kilmar-abrego-garcia-details-how-cecot-is-a-torture-camp/">to a receptive hellhole</a>.</p>
<p>Abrego Garcia fought back. And he has proven to be a constant embarrassment for a government overrun by mouth-breathing bullies. Garcia managed to get un-ejected from the country, exposing multiple lies told by the government while doing so. For that, he was punished further. The administration brought him back just so it could throw him in an American prison, <a data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2025/06/23/judge-shreds-dojs-manufactured-case-against-abrego-garcia-evidence-defies-common-sense/" data-type="link" href="https://www.techdirt.com/2025/06/23/judge-shreds-dojs-manufactured-case-against-abrego-garcia-evidence-defies-common-sense/">claiming he was involved</a> in all sorts of hideous crimes.</p>
<p>A court reasonably found that <a data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2025/10/08/judge-says-govts-prosecution-of-kilmar-abrego-garcia-looks-vindictive-orders-hearing/" data-type="link" href="https://www.techdirt.com/2025/10/08/judge-says-govts-prosecution-of-kilmar-abrego-garcia-looks-vindictive-orders-hearing/">this was vindictive prosecution</a>. It also ordered Abrego Garcia’s release. But the government fought back with an <a data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2025/08/25/dhs-arrests-kilmar-abrego-garcia-with-plans-to-ship-him-to-uganda-because-he-refused-to-plead-guilty-to-fake-human-trafficking-charges/" data-type="link" href="https://www.techdirt.com/2025/08/25/dhs-arrests-kilmar-abrego-garcia-with-plans-to-ship-him-to-uganda-because-he-refused-to-plead-guilty-to-fake-human-trafficking-charges/">absurd (and hideous) trial tax</a>: Garcia could either plead guilty to the (pun intentional?) trumped-up charges or get hurled into a war-torn country where human rights are nearly nonexistent.</p>
<p>This happened despite the fact that Costa Rica agreed to have Abrego Garcia delivered there, as per his request. The legal battle continues, and the Trump regime appears <a data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2025/07/25/dhs-declares-abrego-will-never-walk-americas-streets-hours-after-judges-order-his-release/" data-type="link" href="https://www.techdirt.com/2025/07/25/dhs-declares-abrego-will-never-walk-americas-streets-hours-after-judges-order-his-release/">fully committed to the bit</a>. It will dump Garcia into whatever hellhole it can talk a court into, <a data-id="https://abcnews.go.com/US/trump-administration-moves-dissolve-ban-abrego-garcias-removal/story?id=127329912" data-type="link" href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/trump-administration-moves-dissolve-ban-abrego-garcias-removal/story?id=127329912">rather than allow him to leave the country peaceably for the destination of his choice</a>.</p>
<blockquote> <p><em>The Trump administration has moved to dissolve the ban on <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/judge-presses-doj-intention-deport-kilmar-abrego-garcia/story?id=126909166">Kilmar Abrego Garcia’s removal</a> so that it can proceed with his deportation to Liberia.</em></p> <p><em>In a series of filings overnight, government attorneys said that the Salvadoran native’s claim of fear of torture or persecution in the African nation was denied after he was interviewed by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services last week.</em></p> <p><em>The attorneys for the Department of Justice argued that the preliminary injunction blocking Abrego Garcia’s removal <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/dhs-pressing-deport-kilmar-abrego-garcia-liberia-agreed/story?id=126831679">to Liberia</a> should be dissolved because the government received assurances from the government of the West African country that he will not be persecuted or tortured.</em></p> </blockquote>
<p>Yep, that’s how it’s going in the purported Land of the Free that has spent the past few days stroking itself off in celebration of Veterans Day. American troops, who have done everything they can to prevent foreign countries from becoming what the Trump administration desires to be, are being celebrated for protecting the freedoms this regime considers to be mere privileges.</p>
<p>And let’s all enjoy a long disgusted LOL at the government’s assertions. Liberia’s government <a data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption_in_Liberia" data-type="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption_in_Liberia">is corrupt AF</a> and any assurances it might make about some Venezuelan rando should not be trusted. And, again, if the real reason (as stated multiple times by the administration) is to remove this “dangerous criminal” from the US, what’s wrong with sending him to Costa Rica? The government has already said it will take custody of Abrego Garcia, and it would be another “win” for the administration to add another person to its “self-deportation” column.</p>
<p>But we all know what’s really happening here. The Trump administration wants to punish Abrego Garcia for making them look bad. And sending him to a country he’s agreed to go to doesn’t do that. They need him to feel endangered to make it clear to others who might stand up to having their own civil liberties and rights violated, that they, too, may face similar risks. Abrego Garcia spoke out against the injustices the Trump administration rained down upon him, and for that he must pay.</p>
<p>This constant hate-on is considered a feature, not a bug, by the so-called representatives of the Free World. It’s abhorrent and it should be a constant stain on their legislative histories. Unfortunately, there are no adults with any semblance of a conscience left in the GOP, so we’ll get what we get for as long as people who stroke themselves off to the National Anthem continue to believe this nation’s path to greatness involves destroying everyone’s humanity, including their own.</p>
