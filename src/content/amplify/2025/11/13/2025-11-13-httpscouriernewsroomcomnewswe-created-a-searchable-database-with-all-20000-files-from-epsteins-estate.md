<p>The US House Oversight Committee on Wednesday announced a massive document dump from Jeffrey Epstein’s estate, including thousands of emails discussing a wide range of topics, including women, blackmail, and spending the holidays with Donald Trump.</p>
<p>The 20,000 documents come in the form of poorly organized folders with unhelpful labels, screenshots of emails, and heavily redacted spreadsheets. Some of the files are devoid of context, such as a video in the NATIVES folder of a dog playing with plushies of Trump and Hillary Clinton, while others are broken up in confusing ways, like email chains split into several PDFs.</p>
<p>To make this massive data dump more accessible, COURIER has compiled the 20,000 documents from Epstein’s estate into an easily searchable repository via Google Pinpoint. <a href="https://journaliststudio.google.com/pinpoint/search?collection=092314e384a58618&amp;utm_source=collection_share_link">Use the search tool here.</a></p>

<p>What’s been released is only a small fraction of what the US Department of Justice has collected as part of its investigation into Epstein’s sex trafficking operation. The full “Epstein Files” have been kept from the public due to exhaustive efforts from the Trump administration to avoid transparency, as part of an apparent cover-up to protect wealthy individuals who could be implicated, including the president himself.</p>
<p>A bipartisan effort in the House to release of the Epstein Files made headway this week, after Rep. Adelita Grijalva (D-Ariz.) was sworn into office. Grijalva provided the final signature needed on a discharge petition to force a vote on a resolution to release the files, which had been blocked until now by Trump sycophant and Speaker of the House Mike Johnson. With the petition filed, the vote is expected to take place as early as December 1.</p>
