  Afghan national in custody after shooting of 2 National Guard members near
  White House

<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — An Afghan national has been accused of shooting two West Virginia <a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-judge-ruling-dc-washington-national-guard-1be5c3744e35f8dd68a6a12fa4583186">National Guard members</a> just blocks from the White House in a brazen act of violence at a time when the presence of troops in the nation’s capital and other cities around the country has become a political flashpoint.</p>
<p>FBI Director Kash Patel and Washington <a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/muriel-bowser-washington-dc-trump-0e9f3cfc668fd70faa9820c8bfb4e7a3">Mayor Muriel Bowser</a> said the guard members were hospitalized in critical condition after Wednesday afternoon’s shooting. West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey had walked back his statement Wednesday announcing the troops had died, saying he received “conflicting reports” about their condition.</p>
<p>The rare shooting of National Guard members on American soil, on the day before Thanksgiving, comes amid <a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/national-guard-dc-deployment-c1c2b13a7102632632267bf1262506ff">court fights</a> and a broader public policy debate about the Trump administration’s use of the military to combat what officials cast as an out-of-control crime problem.</p>
<p>The Trump administration quickly ordered 500 more National Guard members to Washington.</p>
<p>The suspect who was in custody also was shot and had wounds that were not believed to be life-threatening, according to a law enforcement official who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke to AP on condition of anonymity.</p>

<p>The 29-year-old suspect, an Afghan national, entered the U.S. in 2021 through Operation Allies Welcome, a Biden administration program that evacuated and resettled tens of thousands of Afghans after the U.S. withdrawal from the country, officials said.</p>
<p>The initiative brought roughly 76,000 people to the U.S., many of whom had worked alongside U.S. troops and diplomats as interpreters and translators. It has since faced intense scrutiny from Trump and his allies, congressional Republicans and some government watchdogs over gaps in the vetting process and the speed of admissions, even as advocates say it offered a lifeline to people at risk of Taliban reprisals.</p>
<p>The suspect, who has been living in Washington state, has been identified by law enforcement officials as Rahmanullah Lakanwal, but authorities were still working to fully confirm his background, two law enforcement officials and a person familiar with the matter said. The people could not discuss details of an ongoing investigation and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.</p>
<p>Lakamal arrived in Bellingham, Washington, about 79 miles (127 kilometers) north of Seattle, with his wife and five children, said his former landlord Kristina Widman.</p>
<p>Wednesday night, in a video message released on social media, President Donald Trump called for the reinvestigation of all Afghan refugees who entered under the Biden administration.</p>
<p>“If they can’t love our country, we don’t want them,” he said, adding that the shooting was “a crime against our entire nation.”</p>
<p>Jeffery Carroll, an executive assistant D.C. police chief, said investigators had no information on a motive. He said the assailant “came around the corner” and immediately started firing at the troops, citing video reviewed by investigators.</p>
<p>“This was a targeted shooting,” Bowser said.</p>
<h2>Troops held down the shooter</h2>
<p>The shooting happened roughly two blocks northwest of the White House near a metro station. Hearing gunfire, other troops in the area ran over and held down the gunman after he was shot, Carroll said.</p>
<p>“It appears to be a lone gunman that raised a firearm and ambushed these members of the National Guard,” Carroll said, adding that it was not clear whether one of the guard members or a law enforcement officer shot the suspect.</p>
<p>“At this point we have no other suspects,” Carroll said at a news conference.</p>
<p>At least one of the guard members exchanged gunfire with the shooter, said another law enforcement official who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.</p>
<p>Social media video shared in the immediate aftermath showed first responders performing CPR on one of the troops and treating the other on a sidewalk covered in broken glass.</p>
<h2>Witnesses saw people fleeing</h2>
<p>Michael Ryan was just across the street when he heard loud bangs and started running with others. When he later came back, he told AP he saw a person pinned to the ground as people shouted “stay down,” and, nearby, National Guard troops hugged each other.</p>
<p>“It’s just a terrible situation to see,” Ryan said.</p>
<p>Emma McDonald, who exited a metro station just after the shots were fired, said she and a friend sought safety with others in a cafe. McDonald told AP that minutes later she saw first responders rolling a stretcher carrying a National Guard member whose head was covered in blood.</p>
<p>Police tape cordoned off the scene, and fire and police vehicle lights flashed and helicopter blades thudded overhead. Agents from the Secret Service and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives were there, and National Guard troops stood sentry nearby. At least one helicopter landed on the National Mall.</p>
<p>“I think it’s a somber reminder that soldiers, whether they’re active duty, reserve or National Guard, our soldiers are the sword and the shield of the United States of America,” Vice President JD Vance said in Fort Campbell, Kentucky, where he delivered a Thanksgiving message to troops.</p>
<p>Gen. Steven Nordhaus, chief of the National Guard Bureau, scrapped plans to spend the holiday with troops at Guantanamo Bay in order to travel to D.C. and be with guard members there instead.</p>
<p>Army Secretary Dan Driscoll said on social media that he visited the wounded National Guard members in the hospital and that his “heart breaks for them.”</p>
<h2>Troops deployed to DC under emergency order</h2>
<p>Trump issued an <a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-washington-crime-national-guard-homelessness-655bc22834223c7dc93115bbcb2b215c">emergency order</a> in August that federalized the local police force and sent in National Guard troops from eight states and the District of Columbia. The order expired a month later, but the troops remained.</p>
<p>Nearly 2,200 troops currently are assigned to the joint task force operating in the city, according to the government’s latest update.</p>
<p>Last week a federal judge ordered an end to the deployment, but she also put her order on hold for 21 days to allow the administration time to either remove the troops or appeal.</p>
<p>The guard members have patrolled neighborhoods, train stations and other locations, participated in highway checkpoints and been assigned to pick up trash and guard sports events.</p>
<p>More than 300 West Virginia National Guard members were deployed in August. About 160 of them volunteered last week to extend their deployment until the end of the year, while the others returned home just over a week ago.</p>
