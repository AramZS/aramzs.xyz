<ul><li>Violence over water is on the rise around the world. Researchers counted a record 420 water-related conflicts last year, including disputes that sparked bloodshed as well as attacks on water systems.</li><li>Dozens of violent incidents occurred in the wars in Ukraine and Gaza. Clashes over water also erupted in countries including India, Iran and Mexico. </li></ul>
<p>In Algeria, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/algeria-drought-rain-tebboune-tiaret-riots-09ce23f4ba235aaf1e3afecc7bfe3574">water shortages</a> left faucets dry, prompting protesters to riot and set tires ablaze.</p>
<p>In Gaza, as people waited for water at a community tap, an Israeli drone fired on them, killing eight.</p>
<p>In Ukraine, Russian rockets slammed into the country’s largest dam, unleashing a <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68640590">plume of fire</a> over the hydroelectric plant and causing <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/03/22/1240115385/russia-attacks-ukrainian-electrical-power-facilities-causing-widespread-outages">widespread blackouts</a>.</p>
<p>These are some of the 420 water-related conflicts researchers documented for 2024 in the latest update of the Pacific Institute’s <a href="https://www.worldwater.org/conflict/map/"><u>Water Conflict Chronology</u></a>, a global database of water-related violence.</p>
<p>The year featured a record number of violent incidents over water around the world, far surpassing the 355 in 2023, continuing a steeply <a href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/newsletter/2024-08-22/boiling-point-water-conflicts-increasing-boiling-point">rising trend</a>. The violence more than quadrupled in the last five years.</p>
<p>The new data from the Oakland-based water think tank show also that drinking water wells, pipes and dams are increasingly coming under attack.</p>
<p>“In almost every region of the world, there is more and more violence being reported over water,” said Peter Gleick, the Pacific Institute’s co-founder and senior fellow, and it “underscores the urgent need for international attention.”</p>
<p>The researchers collect information from news reports and other sources and accounts. They classify it into three categories: instances in which water was a trigger of violence, water systems were targeted and water was a “casualty” of violence, for example when shell fragments hit a water tank.</p>
<p>Not every case involves injuries or deaths but many do.</p>
<p>The region with the most violent incidents was the Middle East, with 138 reported. That included 66 in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, both in Gaza and the West Bank.</p>
<p>In the West Bank there were numerous reports of Israeli settlers destroying water pipelines and tanks and attacking Palestinian farmers.</p>
<p>In Gaza the Israeli military <a href="https://www.arabnews.com/node/2559766/middle-east">destroyed more than 30 wells</a> in the southern towns of Rafah and Khan Younis.</p>
<p>Gleick noted that when the International Criminal Court <a href="https://www.ap.org/news-highlights/spotlights/2024/top-war-crimes-court-issues-arrest-warrants-for-netanyahu-and-others-in-israel-hamas-fighting/"><u>issued arrest warrants</u></a> for Israeli and Hamas leaders last year, accusing them of crimes against humanity, the charges mentioned Israeli military attacks on Gaza water systems.</p>
<p>“It is an acknowledgment that these attacks are violations of international law,” he said. “There ought to be more enforcement of international laws protecting water systems from attacks.”</p>
<p>Water systems also were targeted frequently in the Russia-Ukraine war, in which the researchers tallied 51 violent incidents.</p>

<p>Russian strikes disrupted water service in Ukrainian cities, and <a href="https://gwaramedia.com/en/russian-attack-polluted-kharkiv-rivers-with-oil-products-in-photos/"><u>oil spilled into a river</u></a> after Russian forces attacked an oil depot.</p>
<p>“These aren’t water wars. These are wars in which water is being used as a weapon or is a casualty of the conflict,” Gleick said.</p>
<p>The researchers also found water scarcity and drought are prompting a growing number of violent conflicts.</p>
<p>“Climate change is making those problems worse,” Gleick said.</p>
<p>Many conflicts were in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>In India, residents angry about water shortages assaulted a city worker.</p>

<p>At a refugee camp in Kenya, three people died in a fight over drinking water.</p>
<p>There’s an increase in conflicts over irrigation, disputes pitting farmers against cities, and violence arising in places where only some water is safe to drink.</p>

<p>Gleick, who has been studying water-related violence for more than three decades, said the purpose of the list is to raise awareness and encourage policymakers to act to reduce fighting, bloodshed and turmoil.</p>
<p>The United Nations, in its <a href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/water-and-sanitation/"><u>Sustainable Development Goals,</u></a> says every person should have access to water and sanitation.</p>
<p>“The failure to do that is inexcusable and it contributes to a lot of misery,” Gleick said. “It contributes to ill health, cholera, dysentery, typhoid, water-related diseases, and it contributes to conflicts over water.”</p>

<p>In Latin America, there were dozens of violent incidents involving water last year.</p>
<p>In the Mexican state of Veracruz, protesters were <a href="https://apnews.com/article/mexico-veracruz-pork-processing-protest-e165388026bb9b9e30bddb2a8922418f"><u>blocking a road</u></a> to denounce a pork processing plant, which they accused of using too much water and spewing pollution, when police opened fire, killing two men.</p>

<p>“There needs to be more attention on this issue, especially at the international level, but at the national level as well,” said Morgan Shimabuku, a senior researcher with the Pacific Institute. “It is getting worse, and we need to turn that tide.”</p>
<p>For 2024, there were few events in the U.S., but among them were cyberattacks on water utilities in Texas and Indiana.</p>
<p>In one, Russian hackers claimed responsibility for tampering with an Indiana wastewater treatment plant. Authorities said the attack caused <a href="https://www.wthr.com/article/news/local/russian-hackers-claim-responsibility-for-cybersecurity-attack-on-tipton-indiana-wastewater-treatment-plant/531-7c8d5fc5-aca5-4609-8034-cb2c97c40817"><u>minimal disruption</u></a>.

<p>During extreme drought in Iran <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/16/world/iran-drought-cloud-seeding-dry-fall-climate-latam-intl"><u>worsened by climate change,</u></a> farmers were desperate enough to go up against <a href="https://iranwire.com/en/news/138523-iranian-farmers-stage-sit-in-after-violent-clashes-over-water-rights/"><u>security forces, </u></a>demanding access to river water. Iran’s water crisis, compounded by decades of excessive groundwater pumping, has grown so severe that the president said Tehran <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/irans-capital-has-run-out-of-water-forcing-it-to-move/"><u>no longer can remain the capital</u></a> and the government will have to move it to another city.</p>
<p>Tensions also have been growing between Iran and Afghanistan <a href="https://www.afintl.com/en/202506107808"><u>over the Helmand River</u></a>, with Iranian leaders accusing their upstream neighbor of not letting enough water flow into the country.</p>
<p>Gleick said if the drought persists and the Iranian government doesn’t improve how it manages water, “I would expect to see more violence.”</p>
