<p>The Washington Post is notifying nearly 10,000 employees and contractors that some of their personal and financial data has been exposed in the Oracle data theft attack.</p>
<p>The news organization is one of the largest daily newspapers in the U.S. with approximately 2.5 million digital subscribers.</p>
<p>Between July 10 and August 22, threat actors accessed parts of its network. They leveraged a vulnerability in Oracle E-Business Suite software that was a zero-day at the time to steal sensitive data.</p>
<p>In late September, the hackers tried to extort the Washington Post, along with other major companies they had breached the same way.</p>
<p>The hackers leveraged a then-zero-day vulnerability in Oracle E-Business Suite software that the Washington Post used internally, stole data, and then attempted to extort the firm in late September.</p>
<p>Oracle E-Business Suite is a widely used enterprise resource planning (ERP) platform with HR, finance, and supply chain functions that large organizations use internally.</p>
<p>According to the Washington Post's notification to impacted individuals, Oracle disclosed the security vulnerability while the news organization was investigating the breach incident.</p>
<p>“On September 29, 2025, the Post was contacted by a bad actor who claimed to have gained access to its Oracle E-Business Suite applications,” <a href="https://www.maine.gov/agviewer/content/ag/985235c7-cb95-4be2-8792-a1252b4f8318/12a31419-4ed0-41ba-a045-2593908ba368.html">describes the letter</a>.</p>
<p>“In response, the Post launched a thorough investigation of its Oracle application environment with the assistance of experts to determine if the environment had been accessed without authorization.”</p>
<p>“During the investigation, Oracle announced that it had identified a previously unknown and widespread vulnerability in its E-Business Suite software that permitted unauthorized actors to access many Oracle customers’ E-Business Suite applications.”</p>
<p>Although the attackers aren’t named in the letter, the Clop ransomware group has been <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/oracle-links-clop-extortion-attacks-to-july-security-flaws/">linked to these attacks</a>, exploiting a zero-day flaw that is now tracked as CVE-2025-61884.</p>
<p>Among the organizations that were breached using the same vulnerability in Oracle E-Business Suite are <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/harvard-investigating-breach-linked-to-oracle-zero-day-exploit/">Harvard University</a>, American Airlines subsidiary <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/american-airlines-subsidiary-envoy-confirms-oracle-data-theft-attack/">Envoy Air</a>, and Hitachi’s <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/globallogic-warns-10-000-employees-of-data-theft-after-oracle-breach/">GlobalLogic</a>.</p>
<p>These are some of the victims who have confirmed a breach or are investigating suspicious activity in their environments. However, Clop's data leak site lists a larger number of breached organizations.</p>
<p>The Post’s investigation into the incident concluded on October 27 and revealed that the following types of data belonging to 9,720 employees and contractors had been compromised:</p>
<ul><li>Full names</li> <li>Bank account numbers and routing numbers</li> <li>Social Security numbers (SSNs)</li> <li>Tax and ID numbers</li> </ul>
<p>Impacted individuals received a 12-month free-of-charge identity protection service coverage through IDX and are recommended to consider placing a security freeze on their credit file and setting up fraud alerts on their report.</p>
<p>In June, the Washington Post announced that the email accounts of several of its journalists <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/washington-posts-email-system-hacked-journalists-accounts-compromised/">had been compromised</a> in a cyberattack conducted by foreign state actors.</p>
<p>While the two incidents occurred shortly after one another, there is evidence of a connection between them.</p>
<p>BleepingComputer has contacted The Washington Post with additional questions, and we will update this post when we receive a reply.</p>
