<p>Elon Musk’s social media site X has rolled out a new feature in an effort to increase transparency—and unwittingly revealed that many of the site’s top MAGA influencers are actually foreign actors.</p>
<p>The new “About This Account” feature, which became available to X users on Friday, allows others to see where an account is based, when they joined the platform, how often they have changed their username, and how they downloaded the X app.</p>
<p>Upon rollout, rival factions began to inspect just where their online adversaries were really based on the combative social platform—with dozens of major MAGA and right-wing influencer accounts revealed to be based overseas.</p>
<p>“This is easily one of the greatest days on this platform,” <a href="https://x.com/harryjsisson/status/1992389775945527705">wrote</a> Democratic influencer Harry Sisson.</p>
<p>“Seeing all of these MAGA accounts get exposed as foreign actors trying to destroy the United States is a complete vindication of Democrats, like myself and many on here, who have been warning about this”.</p>

<p><a href="https://x.com/samstein/status/1992408241880637530">Dozens</a> of major accounts masquerading as “America First” or “MAGA” proponents have been identified as originating in places such as Russia, India, and Nigeria.</p>
<p>In one example, the account <a href="https://x.com/MAGANationX">MAGANationX</a>—with nearly 400,000 followers and a bio reading “Patriot Voice for We The People”—is actually based in Eastern Europe.</p>

<p>While About This Account went live on Friday, X’s head of product development, Nikita Bier, <a href="https://x.com/nikitabier/status/1992335925322613127">noted</a> that the change had “a few rough edges,” which they are planning to smooth.</p>
<p>Information around account location, for example, could be altered with the use of a VPN, something Bier has said the company is planning to resolve.</p>
<p>Users on X reported the tool being taken down just hours after it went live, with <a href="https://x.com/johnbourscheid/status/1992246055887650841">some speculating</a> that the uncovering of the origins of far-right accounts may have something to do with its removal. However, it appears to have been reinstated at the time of writing.</p>

<p>The use of imposter accounts on social media to manufacture support for an individual or an ideology has long been observed online in America and across the world.</p>
<p>“Just think about the foreign influence operations that are happening right now on this app,” journalist and MeidasTouch co-founder Brett Meiselas <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DRYUQOFj-aK/?hl=en">said</a> in a video posted to social media about the changes.</p>
<p>“Think about the lawmakers who feel pressured by accounts like this. Think about the disinformation that spreads as a result of all these accounts out there.”</p>
<p>The use of fake accounts to bolster the MAGA movement is something The Centre for Information Resilience, an independent, nonprofit research organization, <a href="https://www.info-res.org/cir/articles/unmasking-the-fake-maga-accounts-stolen-photos-and-digital-lies/">flagged</a> during the 2024 election.</p>
<p>With many of the MAGA influencer accounts revealed to originate in Eastern Europe or Russia, <a href="https://x.com/adamscochran/status/1992383411919425716">users</a> are questioning the ongoing interference in American politics by foreign adversaries.</p>
<p>“Why are so many MAGA influencers from outside the U.S.? It’s almost as if they are working for foreign governments,” <a href="https://x.com/EdKrassen/status/1992225269873258648">wrote</a> influencer Ed Krassenstein.</p>

<p>“You got a peek behind the curtain at just how much of the MAGA hatred is just Russian propaganda,” <a href="https://x.com/adamscochran/status/1992261210524291386">said</a> author and academic Adam Cochran.</p>
<p>Donald Trump and several close associates were investigated for conspiracy or coordination with Russia during the 2016 election. Two of Trump’s campaign members were indicted.</p>
<p>Certain content creators are paid for tweets that drive engagement on the site formerly known as Twitter, which gives them a financial incentive to cash in on the divisive nature of U.S. politics.</p>
<p>For those in countries like Nigeria or Bangladesh, the American dollars paid by X for their work can make a big difference to their lives. X payouts are calculated on the basis of engagement from verified premium accounts with content on X.</p>
<p>The Daily Beast has reached out to X for comment.</p>
