<p>"The things that matter to this analysis and the reason we have water quality standards to protect the public's health—none of that has changed."</p>
<p>Environmental activists have filed a federal lawsuit that aims to stop the fossil fuel pipeline that was recently approved by Governor Kathy Hochul's administration and would run from New Jersey through New York Harbor.</p>
<p>The permit to build the 37-mile pipeline that would supply National Grid with fracked natural gas was denied <a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/2025/09/04/natural-gas-pipeline-hochul-energy-trump-water-quality/?ref=hellgatenyc.com"><u>three times by state regulators</u></a> between 2018 and 2020, in large part because they concluded that the pipeline's construction <a href="https://extapps.dec.ny.gov/docs/permits_ej_operations_pdf/nesewqcdenial05152020.pdf?ref=hellgatenyc.com"><u>would dredge up centuries of consolidated toxins resting</u></a> on the seabed and leech the deadly chemicals into the harbor, impeding the <a href="https://dec.ny.gov/environmental-protection/water/water-quality/new-york-new-jersey-harbor-contaminant-assessment-and-reduction-project?ref=hellgatenyc.com"><u>decades-long effort to clean up the harbor</u></a>.</p>
<p>But two weeks ago, Governor Hochul's Department of Environmental Conservation approved the permit for the pipeline's builders, the Williams Company, to proceed with the project—reportedly <a href="https://hellgatenyc.com/trumps-pipeline-is-now-hochuls-pipeline/"><u>after a deal was cut by Governor Hochul and President Donald Trump</u></a> to get Trump to restore approval to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/20/trump-allows-new-york-offshore-wind-project-after-apparent-gas-pipeline-compromise-with-state.html?ref=hellgatenyc.com"><u>a wind farm off the coast of Long Island</u></a>.</p>
