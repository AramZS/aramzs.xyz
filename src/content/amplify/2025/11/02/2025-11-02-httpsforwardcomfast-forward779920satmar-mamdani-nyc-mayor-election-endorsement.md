<p>In a surprising show of support, Zohran Mamdani secured a major endorsement from one of the largest blocs of voters in the Haredi community, even as he still struggles to earn the trust of many Jews in the race for New York City mayor.</p>
<p>The Satmar Hasidic community in Brooklyn, led by Rabbi Aaron Teitelbaum from Kiryas Joel and known as the Ahronim, is expected to announce it is backing Mamdani at an event Sunday afternoon, according to two sources familiar with the development. It chose Mamdani over former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who also sought their support and was endorsed by them in the Democratic primary.</p>
<p>The approximately 80,000 voters in Brooklyn’s Haredi communities, where rabbinic dictates about ballot choices <a href="https://forward.com/news/465791/how-ranked-choice-voting-might-affect-the-historic-influence-of-nycs/">lead to a reliable bloc of support</a>, are particularly sought after by candidates.</p>
<figure><img alt="Free morning newsletter" src="https://forward.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/forwardingthenews.png"/><figcaption>Free morning newsletter</figcaption></figure>
<p>If Mamdani, a democratic socialist and strident critic of Israel who leads by double digits according to recent polls, wins Tuesday’s election, it would mark the third consecutive mayoral race in which the Ahronim have demonstrated their political influence by backing the eventual winner, while other Hasidic blocs supported rival candidates.</p>
<p>In 2021, they <a href="https://forward.com/fast-forward/471077/satmar-group-endorses-eric-adams-for-mayor-battle-over-orthodox-vote/">endorsed</a> Eric Adams over Andrew Yang, who was <a href="https://forward.com/fast-forward/470202/yang-orthodox-votes-hasidic-locked-up/">favored</a> by most leading Hasidic sects. And in 2013, they backed Bill de Blasio, who narrowly avoided a runoff in the Democratic primary by just 5,000 votes, while the Zalonim and other groups <a href="https://forward.com/news/breaking-news/183059/a-satmar-rally-to-endorse-mayoral-candidate-bill-t/">supported</a> Bill Thompson, then seen as the frontrunner.</p>
<p>The move to endorse Mamdani came days after Satmar, including the larger sect led by Rabbi Zalmen Teitelbaum from Williamsburg and known as the Zalonim, declared that they would not endorse any candidate for mayor while also condemning the “fear campaign” and attacks on Mamdani. They also met with Cuomo on Wednesday night, accompanied by Mayor Eric Adams, but ultimately declined to back him.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://x.com/jacobkornbluh/status/1983560665760715150">open letter</a> to their followers published on Wednesday, the Satmar leadership highlighted Mamdani’s gestures that specifically addressed their concerns. They noted that the Democratic nominee has said he would <a href="https://forward.com/fast-forward/727474/nyc-mayor-mamdani-orthodox-hasidic/">work to protect</a> Hasidic yeshivas that face scrutiny for failing to meet state education standards and promised that Hasidic families would benefit from his proposals to expand affordable housing and establish universal childcare.</p>
<p>If Mamdani wins, he would become the first Muslim mayor of New York City, home to the largest concentration of Jews in the U.S.</p>
<p>Moshe Indig, a political leader of the Satmar sect, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/10/nyregion/adams-jewish-cuomo-endorsement.html">told <i>The New York Times</i></a> during the primary that he was open to supporting Mamdani after their first interaction. Indig said the candidate came across as “very nice, very humble,” and assured him he is not antisemitic.</p>
<p>Cuomo still enjoys broad support among Jewish voters, who make up an estimated 10% of the general election electorate. A recent <a href="https://forward.com/fast-forward/779710/nyc-mayor-race-poll-cuomo-jewish-vote/">Quinnipiac poll</a> of 170 Jewish voters showed Cuomo with 60% of their support and Mamdani with 16%, while a separate <a href="https://maristpoll.marist.edu/polls/nyc-mayors-race-october-2025/">Marist poll</a> of 792 likely voters — including an 11% sample of Jewish voters — found Cuomo with 55% and Mamdani at 32% among Jewish respondents.</p>
<p>Cuomo also has the backing of most Orthodox groups that helped swing the 2021 mayoral race for Adams, including the <a href="https://www.theyeshivaworld.com/news/general/2463000/flatbush-jewish-community-coalition-endorses-andrew-cuomo-for-mayor-announces-full-slate-of-local-candidates.html">Flatbush Jewish Community Coalition</a> and the two largest voting blocs in Borough Park — <a href="https://x.com/jacobkornbluh/status/1587497006372716546">Bobov </a>and <a href="https://x.com/jacobkornbluh/status/1983219623487995963">Belz</a>. The remaining 25 Hasidic sects and yeshivas in Borough Park have declined to issue a recommendation in the current race.</p>
