<p>The media company summarily dismissed four employees, including a fact-checker at the 100-year-old magazine, for “extreme misconduct.” Many of its famous writers are outraged.</p>
<p>This was supposed to be a season for celebration at the New Yorker.</p>
<p>A year’s worth of 100th-anniversary festivities for the crown jewel of Condé Nast’s media empire is set to culminate on Dec. 5 with the release of a Netflix documentary, “The New Yorker at 100,” meant to offer a glimpse behind the scenes for the reading public — and a moment of pride for the people who work for a standard-bearer of magazine journalism.</p>
