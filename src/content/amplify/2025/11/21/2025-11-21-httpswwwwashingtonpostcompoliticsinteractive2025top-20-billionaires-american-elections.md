<p>Campaign donations from the country’s richest are soaring. But only 12 percent of the public says billionaires have a positive impact on society.</p>
<p>November 21, 2025 at 5:00 a.m. EST32 minutes ago</p>
<p>In the past decade, billionaires have been <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/interactive/2025/billionaires-politics-money-influence/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template">more empowered than ever before</a> to spend money to influence American elections.</p>
<p>The 20 most prolific donors on the Forbes billionaires list have collectively given nearly $5 billion between 2015 and 2024, spending on everything from state ballot measures to congressional elections and presidential races. Some have concentrated on supporting issues of interest. Finance billionaire Jeff Yass has poured millions into supporting pro-school-choice candidates in his home state of Pennsylvania and across the country.</p>
<p>While some billionaires have given similar amounts to both parties, the most prolific donors gave almost exclusively to one party. In federal races, LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman gave just under 90 percent of his total donations to Democrats and liberal committees; all the other top 20 donors were even more lopsided. Nobody gave over $5 million to both Republicans and Democrats.</p>
<p>The Post’s analysis was confined to billionaires identified by Forbes, so some prolific donors, such as conservative investor Tim Mellon, who donated $197 million to influence federal elections last year, are absent from the count.</p>

<p>While the super-rich give massive sums of money, their political giving is often not a major expenditure given their massive net worths. The top donor, Miriam Adelson (along with her late husband, Sheldon), gave about $658 million to influence elections between 2015 and 2024. At a net worth of $32.1 billion, that represents about 2 percent of her current net worth. For a typical American family, worth about $191,000, that would be like giving $390 a year to political candidates. Elon Musk gave $294 million in 2024 alone, comparable to a typical family spending about $160.</p>
<p>Here are the billionaires who make up the top 20 political spenders:</p>

<p>Methodology</p>
<p>The Post identified billionaires from the Forbes 400 list who were among the top 1,000 donors in federal elections for each cycle since 2000 using data provided by <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template">OpenSecrets</a>. This data included giving to FEC committees and 527-nonprofit groups that spent on influencing elections. Giving by married couples was grouped together. Donations to an individual’s own political campaign were excluded.</p>
<p>The Post also included state-level political giving to candidates and ballot measures between 2015 and 2024 from OpenSecrets for all 50 states. This was supplemented with state PAC data from <a href="https://www.transparencyusa.org/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template">Transparency USA</a> for 2017 through 2024 for 24 states.</p>
<p>The Post relied on OpenSecrets’ partisan classifications of federal data to analyze donation recipients and identified a donor as “primarily” supporting a party if at least 75 percent of their total giving went to candidates, committees or political nonprofits promoting Republican or Democratic ideology.</p>
