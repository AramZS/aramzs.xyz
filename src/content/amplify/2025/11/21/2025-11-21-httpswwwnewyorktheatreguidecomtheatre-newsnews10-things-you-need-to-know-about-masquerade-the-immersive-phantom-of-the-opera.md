  10 things you need to know about 'Masquerade,' the immersive 'Phantom of the
  Opera'
---
<p>New York's newest hotspot is an underground lair, an opera house, a repurposed art shop, and an exclusive, formal ball all in one. Yes, we're talking about <a href="https://www.newyorktheatreguide.com/show/44745-masquerade"><em>Masquerade</em></a>, the buzzy blockbuster musical now playing after months of cryptic teasers and appearances by the Phantom himself across the city.</p>
<p>He's now taken up residence at 218 W 57th St. in this immersive reimagining of <em>The Phantom of the Opera</em>, the longest-running Broadway show of all time. Since its 2023 closing, phans have longed to revisit the story of the mysterious title character, who becomes obsessed with opera ingenue Christine Daaé.</p>
<p><em>Masquerade</em> is your chance not just to hear the music of the night again, but become part of it: You'll step into the opera house and go on a journey through the Phantom's darkest dreams. To help you prepare for this interactive and all-surrounding experience, we're here to unmask <em>Masquerade</em> with 10 tips to know before you go.</p>
<p>Get <a href="https://www.newyorktheatreguide.com/show/44745-masquerade"><em>Masquerade</em> tickets</a> now.</p>
<h4><p>Masquerade is an immersive show.</p></h4>
<p>Immersive theatre completely collapses the boundary between the show and its audience. Instead of sitting down and looking at a stage, you walk through a building that's been wholly transformed into the world of the show, and the actors perform all around you as you go.</p>
<p>In <em>Masquerade</em>'s case, that world encompasses Paris's Opera Populaire and its shadowy underbelly, recreated across the multiple floors of the venue. You might go from a rehearsal room to the theatre's wings to a dressing room to the Phantom's lair to a ballroom as you move between rooms and floors.</p>

<p>In <em>Masquerade</em>'s case, the actors don't just perform around you, but involve you. The Phantom may take your hand and lead you to the next room, or touch your shoulder as he sings you a line of "Music of the Night." Maybe you'll be asked to play a rehearsal piano, volunteer in a circus act, or read a letter.</p>
<p>Everyone's experience is slightly different — but don't fear the interactivity! You'll be clearly directed where to go and what to do throughout, and most interactions are pretty brief.</p>
<h4><p>Masquerade has a specific dress code.</p></h4>
<p><em>Masquerade</em> is described as the Phantom's personal masquerade ball, and he's a strict host. Audience members must wear cocktail or formal attire in black, white, and/or silver only. A mask, of course, is also required, but they're provided at the venue if you don't own one.</p>
<p>Additionally, the dress code prohibits thin heels (like stilettos and kitten heels) since you have to walk over a grate at one point. There's also a lot of stair-climbing throughout <em>Masquerade</em>, so be sure your shoes are easy to walk in.</p>
<h4><p>The Masquerade experience is fully guided.</p></h4>
<p>Some immersive shows are "choose-your-own-adventure" style, where audiences can roam the venue as they wish. <em>Masquerade</em> isn't one of those; the experience is linear, and performers and staff will guide your group through it for the whole 2 hours.</p>
<p>At some points, groups will be split up to experience certain scenes simultaneously, but you'll ultimately come back together. So don't panic if you're separated from your friends!</p>

<h4><p>The audience experiences the show in groups called "pulses."</p></h4>
<p>Every performance of <em>Masquerade</em> is technically six shows in one. When you buy your ticket, you'll choose one of six entry times, which are staggered by 15 minutes. That means other groups, called "pulses," will be in the venue at the same time, experiencing the show in succession. (That's why it's not free-roam.)</p>
<p>Remarkably, the flow is so seamless that you'd never know other performances are happening at the same time.</p>
<h4><p>Six different pairs of Phantoms and Christines perform each night.</p></h4>
<p>Depending on which entry time you pick, you'll see a different pair of actors as the Phantom and Christine. That makes <em>Masquerade</em> ripe for repeat trips — pick a different entry time, and you'll see a different duo.</p>
<p>The pairings perform in the same order each night. They include:</p>
<ul> <li>Kyle Scatliffe and Eryn LeCroy (1/7 p.m.)</li> <li>Telly Leung and Haile Ferrier (1:15/7:15 p.m.)</li> <li>Hugh Panaro and Francesca Mehrotra (1:30/7:30 p.m.)</li> <li>Nik Walker and Kaley Ann Voorhees (1:45/7:45 p.m.)</li> <li>Clay Singer and Riley Noland (2/8 p.m.)</li> <li>Jeff Kready and Anna Zavelson (2:15/8:15 p.m.)</li> </ul>
<p>Similarly, three different actors alternate as Raoul (performing for two pulses each), and two actresses alternate as Madame Giry and Carlotta throughout the show. And, in one scene, Meg Giry is played by one of the other Christines!</p>

<h4><p>Masquerade gives the Phantom an expanded backstory.</p></h4>
<p>Unlike <em>The Phantom of the Opera</em>, <em>Masquerade</em> largely unfolds from the point of view of the Phantom, a facially deformed outcast. Newly invented scenes show the Phantom's time in the freak show circuit as a child, how he eventually came to the opera house, and how he acquired his iconic mask.</p>
<p>Plus, we see certain events from the musical through his eyes as never before — like the disasters he wreaks on the opera house as obsessive passion for Christine consumes him.</p>
<h4><p>The iconic moments from the Broadway musical are all here.</p></h4>
<p>Though <em>Masquerade</em> takes liberties with the flow of the original <em>Phantom of the Opera</em>, "phans" will still experience all the major moments they know and love.</p>
<p>You'll see the crashing chandelier, the monkey music box, and the ghostly gondola floating through the Phantom's lair. You'll hear "The Music of the Night," "All I Ask of You," "The Phantom of the Opera," and all the other hits from Andrew Lloyd Webber's score. And keep an eye out for other <em>Phantom</em> Easter eggs, like a nod to Christine's violinist father and a poster displaying the Phantom's real name.</p>

<h4><p>Masquerade is an indoor/outdoor show.</p></h4>
<p><em>Masquerade</em> truly makes use of the entire venue: Weather permitting, two thrilling scenes unfold on the roof. (Fans can probably guess at least one.) Be sure to dress accordingly; you'll be out there for a good 15 minutes.</p>
<p>Bonus: If you're passing by the venue while the rooftop scene is going on, you might be able to hear the singing from the sidewalk if you time it right.</p>
<p>The <em>Masquerade</em> experience isn't over when the show ends. Afterward, you'll exit into a candlelit bar area where you can buy drinks and merch, hang out with your friends, and snap photos. Sometimes, cast members even join the post-show fun! This is a masquerade ball, after all, and you're an esteemed guest. Take your fill, and let the spectacle astound you.</p>
