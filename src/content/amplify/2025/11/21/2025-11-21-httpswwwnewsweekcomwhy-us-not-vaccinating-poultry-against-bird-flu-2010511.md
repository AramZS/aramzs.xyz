title: Why Is the US Not Vaccinating Poultry Against Bird Flu?
---
<p>As bird flu wreaks havoc across the United States, with devastating consequences for birds, dairy herds, and even humans, the decision not to vaccinate poultry has increasingly come under scrutiny.</p>
<p>While other countries have used vaccines as part of their strategy to control outbreaks of the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus, the U.S. remains on the sidelines, citing trade concerns and logistical challenges.</p>
<h2>Is There a Bird Flu Vaccine?</h2>
<p>Vaccines for <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/h5n1-bird-flu-money-us-government-spending-avian-influenza-2010212">H5N1 bird flu</a> have been available for years and have shown effectiveness in reducing infections and disease transmission in poultry.</p>
<p>Countries like the Netherlands and France have developed and tested these <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/rfk-jr-vaccine-ban-donald-trump-1986441">vaccines</a>, with France rolling out a vaccination program for farm ducks in 2023.</p>
<p>According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), there are several licensed vaccines for avian influenza in poultry, but their use has not been authorized during the ongoing outbreak.</p>

<h2>What Countries Vaccinate Poultry Against Bird Flu?</h2>
<p>France's vaccination campaign has significantly curbed outbreaks. Between Autumn 2023 and April 2024, <a href="https://agriculture.gouv.fr/influenza-aviaire-six-mois-apres-le-debut-de-la-campagne-de-vaccination-des-canards-un-premier">the country reported only 10 outbreaks</a> compared to 315 during the same period the previous year.</p>
<p>Mexico and other countries have also embraced vaccination, sometimes achieving temporary disease-free status before experiencing isolated flare-ups.</p>
<p>France itself was declared bird flu-free on December 18, 2024, thanks in large part to its vaccination program. However, it was only a few days later that two more outbreaks on farms were picked up in the European nation, highlighting the challenge of containing such a virulent disease.</p>
<p>Vaccines are "no silver bullet," Andrew deCoriolis, executive director of Farm Forward, an advocacy group focused on ending factory farming, told <em>Newsweek</em>.</p>
<p>Yet, according to deCoriolis, they do represent "the best tools that we have right now to slow the spread of the virus are things like vaccination, and it's clear that quote unquote biosecurity measures and other preventative methods are not going to work."</p>
<h2>Why Is the Vaccine Not Used in the US?</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/poulty-eggs-ban-hong-kong-chicken-trade-us-1851308">U.S. poultry</a> industry is reluctant to vaccinate birds due to the potential impact on exports. Most countries, including major importers of U.S. poultry, refuse to recognize vaccinated meat as bird flu-free.</p>
<p>This has led to fears that vaccination could devastate the nearly $6 billion poultry export market.</p>
<p>"The only reason that we are not vaccinating poultry against bird flu is because the chicken companies don't want to," deCoriolis said. "Industrial meat companies rely on export markets for their business model, and they simply don't want to lose those export markets."</p>
<p>The National Chicken Council has openly cited this concern. In 2023, its senior vice president of communications <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/05/health/bird-flu-vaccine/index.html#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThe%20National%20Chicken%20Council%20does,the%20presence%20of%20the%20disease.">told CNN</a> that protecting trade relationships was a primary reason for opposing vaccination.</p>

<p>The USDA acknowledges these challenges, too. "A national vaccination strategy includes challenges for domestic implementation, including the cost and logistics of an effective national strategy, the development of appropriate surveillance programs, and minimizing potential trade ramifications," a spokesperson told <em>Newsweek</em>.</p>
<p>Despite these concerns, critics argue that the economic risks are being prioritized over public health.</p>
<p>"The USDA is currently subsidizing chicken companies when they have outbreaks," deCoriolis said.</p>
<p>"American taxpayers have spent billions in the last two years bailing out chicken and turkey companies that have had outbreaks. If they don't vaccinate, they keep their export market; if they have a bird flu outbreak, they get a bailout."</p>
<p>Yet the USDA hasn't ruled out vaccinations as an option and is working towards vaccines designed to protect dairy cows.</p>
<p>"USDA has approved several vaccine field safety studies for vaccine candidates designed to protect dairy cows from H5N1," the spokesperson said. "Field studies are only one part of the licensure process, which includes several steps to ensure the purity, safety, potency and efficacy of a U.S.-licensed veterinary biologic."</p>
<h2>What Consequences Could Result From This?</h2>
<p>The current U.S. approach—dubbed "stamping out"—relies on mass culling of infected flocks, enhanced surveillance and biosecurity measures.</p>
<p>But with over 100 million birds dead or culled during this outbreak, many experts see this strategy as unsustainable.</p>
<p>"I'm afraid right now we're on track to having a serious human pandemic," deCoriolis said. "It's not only that we're not employing every tool in the toolbox, but that governments and regulators are even more hesitant now to take swift, decisive action because of the public backlash to some of the efforts under COVID."</p>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (<a href="https://www.newsweek.com/topic/cdc">CDC</a>) has so far assessed the public health risk as low, even as 66 human cases have been reported, including a severe case in Louisiana.</p>
<p>However, the virus's continued spread in animals gives it more opportunities to mutate into a strain that could transmit more easily among humans.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the financial cost of the outbreak continues to mount. Data obtained under the Freedom of Information Act by animal welfare advocacy group Our Honor revealed the government had spent $840 million on indemnity payments to farmers between 2022 and February of last year alone.</p>
<h2>Where Does This Leave the US?</h2>
<p>The USDA has not ruled out vaccination entirely. "We remain committed to using every tool in USDA's toolbox as we leave no stone unturned in the fight against H5N1," the spokesperson said.</p>
<p>"This includes investments in vaccine research and development across species, as well as emphasizing and communicating about all available strategies and dairy producer support programs available—particularly the importance of strong biosecurity safeguards as our best defense against Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza H5N1."</p>
<p>Still, time may be running out. If the virus continues to spread unchecked, the risks of a human pandemic grow with each outbreak.</p>
