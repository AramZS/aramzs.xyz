<p>Scientists at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have been told to phase out all of their monkey research, <em>Science</em> has learned. The directive, communicated to CDC staff by a former Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) employee and recent college graduate who is now a top official at the agency, will end studies on approximately 200 macaques. The fate of the animals—largely used in work on HIV prevention—is unclear; some may be transferred to primate sanctuaries, others may be euthanized.</p>
<p>Apart from the <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/us-chimp-retirement-gains-momentum-famed-pair-enters-sanctuary">retirement of research chimpanzees</a> initiated by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) a decade ago, the move would mark the first time a U.S. agency has ended its in-house nonhuman primate program. “It’s unprecedented,” says Sally Thompson-Iritani, the assistant vice provost responsible for the University of Washington’s animal care program.</p>
<p>Since President Donald Trump took office in January, the heads of several U.S. research agencies—including the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Environmental Protection Agency, and the National Institutes of Health (NIH)—have announced plans to reduce their reliance on animal studies. Instead, the agencies aim to invest more in organ chips and other “<a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/u-s-wants-phase-out-animal-research-are-alternatives-ready">new approach methodologies</a>.”</p>
<p>CDC’s order was communicated by a relatively unknown former DOGE employee named Sam Beyda, several sources tell <em>Science</em>. Beyda—who was recently named CDC’s deputy chief of staff, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has <a href="https://www.swoknews.com/coronavirus/hhs-proposes-new-cdc-programs-including-hepatitis-b-screening/article_c0fbffe5-379c-5a85-a916-9b77c09d2372.htmlhttps:/www.swoknews.com/coronavirus/hhs-proposes-new-cdc-programs-including-hepatitis-b-screening/article_c0fbffe5-379c-5a85-a916-9b77c09d2372.html">confirmed to <em>Bloomberg News</em></a>—has a sparse online presence with no obvious evidence of a science background. He graduated with a degree in economics from Columbia University in 2023, and in 2020 he co-authored an editorial <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/09/22/altruistic-kidney-donation-covid-19-challenge-trial-participation/">expressing interest in volunteering</a> to be a human subject for a <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/controversial-human-challenge-trials-covid-19-vaccines-gain-support">COVID-19 vaccine challenge trial</a>.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, Beyda told CDC to wind down its primate research program, according to a government official who is familiar with the situation but who asked not to be identified for fear of reprisal. The agency has an <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/about/leadership/director.html">acting director</a>, but, according to the official, Beyda said he was speaking for HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who recently has made curtailing animal research part of his Make America Healthy Again agenda. (Beyda has also been newly tapped to lead several initiatives that will restructure CDC, <em>Bloomberg</em> reports.)</p>
<p>The monkeys—a mix of rhesus and pig-tailed macaques housed at CDC’s Atlanta headquarters—have been used to study HIV, hepatitis, and other infectious diseases. HHS aims to approve a plan to shut down the research by the end of the year, according to the government source. It’s all happening “ferociously fast,” that person says. “There is no choice but to end the program.”</p>
<p>CDC did not respond directly to questions about its monkey program, but an agency spokesperson told <em>Science</em> by email: “CDC regularly evaluates its research project portfolio including non-human primate studies and strives to use non-animal research methods whenever feasible.”</p>
<p>The White Coat Waste Project, an advocacy group that has been pushing to end government support for animal research for years, cheers the decision. “This is exceeding our expectations,” says Justin Goodman, the organization’s senior vice president of advocacy and public policy. “We think this will set a standard for other agencies.”</p>
<p>Biomedical scientists warn the move will be a big mistake. CDC’s monkey research program has been critical for developing <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/17/9/1192">pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV</a>, they say, a prevention strategy that has helped slash infection rates around the world. The program also evaluates preventives for several other sexually transmitted infections, says Demetre Daskalakis, former director of the agency’s Division of HIV Prevention. (Daskalakis resigned in August over concerns about the direction CDC was taking under the Trump administration.) “Whatever next drug Merck or Gilead will come up with to prevent these diseases, I’m not sure where that’s going to happen if it doesn’t start at CDC,” he says.</p>
<p>“It’s a huge loss for the HIV field,” adds Deborah Fuller, director of the Washington National Primate Research Center who has studied HIV for 30 years. She says CDC’s monkey research has been at the forefront of developing microbicides that protect women from HIV—something other animal models have failed to do. “There are no real alternatives.”</p>
<p>Some of the animals in the current program are in the middle of studies, the government official adds. If those end prematurely, that person says, “all of this research will be lost, and the investment wasted.”</p>

<p>The eventual fate of the monkeys is uncertain. Employees have pushed for a gradual phaseout and asked that the animals be transferred to one of the national primate research centers run by universities or another government institute, so the research can continue. But HHS appears to have other plans.</p>
<p>In late October, Beyda reached out to Scott Kubisch, who runs the Peaceable Primate Sanctuary, one of the largest monkey refuges in North America. The Winamac, Indiana, facility has made a name for itself by <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/should-aging-lab-monkeys-be-retired-sanctuaries">working with academic labs to retire their former research animals</a>. “He wanted to know how many monkeys we could take immediately,” Kubisch says, “and whether it would be possible to retire all of them within a year.”</p>
<p>That would be a tall order for any sanctuary, even one as large as Peaceable Primate. Funding for the retirement of lab monkeys has traditionally come from individual facilities and private donors; Kubisch says it would take close to $14 million—and at least a year—for Peaceable Primate to prepare for an additional 200 monkeys. “I’m very interested in working with them,” he says. “It just hinges on funding.”</p>
<p>All of this also assumes the animals can be transported and cared for. Thompson-Iritani says any monkeys infected with SHIV, a mash up of the simian and human viruses, could not be moved for safety reasons and would likely have to be euthanized—something she calls an “incredibly irresponsible” decision.</p>
<p>CDC’s monkey program was in jeopardy even before it was ordered to be shut down. A U.S. House of Representatives budget bill that sets 2026 spending levels for CDC would zero out funding for the HIV division at the agency. If the Senate agrees in a final funding bill, studies on most of CDC’s monkeys would end, says a high-level agency source who asked not to be named for fear of reprisal. “There seems to be an explicit desire to stop nonhuman primate research in toto.”</p>
<p>Scientists involved with primate research at other agencies are watching the CDC situation anxiously. “We have no clarity on our institutional support or funding—it’s a huge problem for morale and our ability to function,” says a senior investigator at FDA, which currently houses about 45 baboons and macaques; the animals are used in pertussis, tuberculosis, and other disease research. “If the program is in danger, we’ll be the last to know,” says the investigator, who asked not to be identified for fear of retaliation. (In a response to a query from <em>Science</em>, HHS did not address plans to shut down monkey research at FDA, but it did point to the agency’s <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/186092/download?attachment">road map for reducing toxicology testing on the animals</a>.)</p>
<p>Regardless of what happens, Thompson-Iritani says government agencies need to put more thought into what to do with lab monkeys once studies end. In addition to CDC and FDA, NIH oversees nearly 7000 nonhuman primates, so a lot is at stake, she says. “We have a responsibility to take care of these animals. That should be included in any road map,” Thompson-Iritani says. “Because I don’t think this will stop with CDC.”</p>
