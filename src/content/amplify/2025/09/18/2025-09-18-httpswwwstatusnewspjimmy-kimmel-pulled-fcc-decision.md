<p>Inside ABC, emergency meetings were convened after the FCC chair’s Jimmy Kimmel threat, with the late-night host ready to respond on-air—but Disney brass ultimately decided to bench the marquee talent instead.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, <strong>Federal Communications Commission </strong>Chairman <strong>Brendan Carr </strong>dropped in via webcam for an appearance on far-right personality <strong>Benny Johnson’s </strong>program. That the FCC chairman would sit down with Johnson at all was remarkable in itself. Johnson has built his brand trafficking in <strong>MAGA</strong> memes, misinformation, and cultural outrage; not typically the type of programming a government official would want to lend their credibility to. In any case, it wasn’t the venue alone that raised eyebrows. It was what Carr said once the program started taping.</p>

Notably, Kimmel never stated that the suspect was on the right, but that is how many interpreted the remarks.</p>
<p>Indeed, Carr took significant issue with the comment, first dismissing Kimmel as “frankly talentless” on Johnson’s show. He then went further, delivering a naked threat aimed at <strong>Disney</strong>, ABC’s parent company: “This is a very, very serious issue right now for Disney,” he said. “We can do this the easy way or the hard way.

<p>Carr’s appearance set off an immediate cascade of events inside ABC. According to people familiar with the matter, the network held a series of emergency meetings…</p>
