<p>A data broker owned by the country’s major airlines, including American Airlines, United, and Delta, is selling access to five billion plane ticketing records to the government for warrantless searching and monitoring of peoples’ movements, including by the FBI, Secret Service, ICE, and many other agencies, according to a new contract and other records reviewed by 404 Media.</p>
<p>The contract provides new insight into the scale of the sale of passengers’ data by the Airlines Reporting Corporation (ARC), the airlines-owned data broker. The contract shows ARC’s data includes information related to more than 270 carriers and is sourced through more than 12,800 travel agencies. ARC <a href="https://www.404media.co/airlines-dont-want-you-to-know-they-sold-your-flight-data-to-dhs/"><u>has previously told the government</u></a> to not reveal to the public where this passenger data came from, which includes peoples’ names, full flight itineraries, and financial details.</p>
<p><b><strong>Do you know anything else about ARC or the sale of this data? I would love to hear from you. Using a non-work device, you can message me securely on Signal at joseph.404 or send me an email at joseph@404media.co.</strong></b></p>
