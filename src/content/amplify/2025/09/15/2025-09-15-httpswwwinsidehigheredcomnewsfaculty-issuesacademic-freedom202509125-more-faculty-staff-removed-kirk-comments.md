<p>At least seven faculty and staff members have been fired or suspended so far for comments they made in response to the death of Turning Point USA founder and conservative firebrand <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/students/free-speech/2025/09/11/charlie-kirk-killing-feeds-fears-higher-eds-future">Charlie Kirk</a>, who was shot and killed Wednesday during an event at Utah Valley University.</p>
<p>Investigators announced Friday they arrested a suspect, 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, who is now being held in a Utah jail without bail. Utah governor Spencer Cox said during a press conference Friday that a family friend turned Robinson in to authorities after the suspect suggested to a relative that he’d killed Kirk. Robinson was not a student at Utah Valley.</p>
<p>The Utah Board of Higher Education <a href="https://x.com/higheredutah/status/1966537262306382189">said in a statement</a> that Robinson is a third-year student in the electrical apprenticeship program at Dixie Technical College and that he attended Utah State University for one semester in 2021.</p>
<p>Dozens of Republican politicians and other conservatives spent the weekend calling for Clemson University to fire three employees who they believed disparaged Kirk in social media posts. The campaign for their ouster caught the attention of President Donald Trump, who reposted a Truth Social message from South Carolina state representative Jordan Pace that said, “That’s it, now Clemson faculty are inciting violence against conservatives. It’s time for a special session to end this. Defund Clemson. End Tenure at State colleges.”</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/ClemsonUniv/status/1966891746400293215">statement Saturday</a>, Clemson officials said one employee had been suspended while the university continues to investigate their social media posts. “We understand the frustration, and we share the deep concern over the nature of these posts. However, we will continue to act within the bounds of the law and our University policies to ensure accountability and integrity.”</p>
<p>Among other college employees terminated for their responses to Kirk’s killing, University of Miami officials <a href="https://x.com/umiamimedicine/status/1966915659620635126">announced Saturday</a> they removed an unnamed employee for “unacceptable public commentary.”</p>
<p>Lisa Greenlee was removed as a part-time instructor from Guilford Technical Community College in Jamestown, N.C., on Thursday after she made comments criticizing Kirk to students during an online class, saying, “I’ll praise the shooter; he had good aim.” A video of her remarks made the rounds on X, where right-wing accounts encouraged the college to fire her.</p>
<p>“We deeply regret that students, employees, and the community were impacted by her comments. Greenlee’s behavior is not consistent with the college’s values and mission to serve Guilford County. Her statement regarding the assassination of Charlie Kirk does not support the open and respectful learning and working environment that GTCC provides every day,” GTCC president Anthony Clarke said in a statement. “We want to reiterate that supporting violence is reprehensible and will not be tolerated at the college.” Greenlee did not respond to <em>Inside Higher Ed</em>’s request for comment.</p>
<p>Two employees at Cumberland University in Lebanon, Tenn., were dismissed Thursday for making “inappropriate comments on the internet related to the tragic shooting of Charlie Kirk,” university president Paul Stumb wrote in a <a href="https://x.com/CumberlandU/status/1966523444251558156/photo/1">statement posted on X</a>. He identified the employees as Michael Rex, an English and creative writing professor, and Max Woods, an assistant esports coach, but he did not share what they said. Like Greenlee, both had been the subject of online campaigns advocating for their firing.</p>
<p>“This decision was not made lightly,” Stumb wrote. “We understand the importance and the impact of this action, and we want to emphasize that we conducted a comprehensive investigation prior to making our decision.”</p>
<p>Before Stumb’s statement was publicized, Rex posted an apology on his Facebook page. “No one deserves to be murdered,” he wrote. “I did not think about the pain and anger that my words would create. My comments were not meant to celebrate nor to foster political violence and for any traums [<em>sic</em>] my words caused, I am truly sorry.” Rex and Wood did not respond to <em>Inside Higher Ed</em>’s request for comment.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/09/12/staff-members-fired-grad-student-punished-cheering-charlie-kirks-death">The recent firings follow the dismissals</a> of Laura Sosh-Lightsy, a student affairs administrator at Middle Tennessee State University, and an unnamed staff member at the University of Mississippi.</p>
