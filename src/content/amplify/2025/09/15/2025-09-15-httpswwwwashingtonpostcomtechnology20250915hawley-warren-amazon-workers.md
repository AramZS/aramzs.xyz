<p>In a letter to Amazon founder and Post owner Jeff Bezos, Sens. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat, and Josh Hawley, a Republican, say Harvard data suggests the retailer’s hourly workers have unfair, volatile schedules.</p>
<p>Amazon, the second largest private employer in the United States, is under fresh bipartisan scrutiny from federal lawmakers over its treatment of workers.</p>
<p>In a letter to Amazon founder and executive chair Jeff Bezos sent Friday, Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts) and Josh Hawley (R-Missouri) raised concerns about how the company schedules shifts for hourly warehouse and delivery workers. A 2024 survey from the Shift Project at the Harvard Kennedy School suggests those employees are required to use a system that can leave them with “volatile and unreliable schedules — and uncertain paychecks,” the senators wrote.</p>
