<p dir="ltr">WASHINGTON — Planned Parenthood clinics throughout the country began telling Medicaid patients Friday that their routine health care appointments will no longer be covered as a federal court order takes effect. </p><p dir="ltr">The change, which could remain in place for months, if not longer, will likely impact the hundreds of thousands of Medicaid enrollees who go to Planned Parenthood clinics for health care not related to abortion. </p><p dir="ltr">“This decision is devastating to patients here in the state and across this country. And it is compounding what is an already broken and overstretched health care system,” said Shireen Ghorbani, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Association of Utah. “We know that cancers will go undetected, STIs will go untreated.”</p><p dir="ltr">Dominique Lee, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts, said there is no plan for other health care providers to absorb the Medicaid enrollees. </p><p dir="ltr">“There’s no one waiting in the wings to take care of our patients,” Lee said. “Planned Parenthood is the safety net.”</p><p dir="ltr">Planned Parenthood has identified at least 200 clinics out of about 600 that could close if they cannot treat Medicaid patients and receive reimbursements from <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/gop-tax-cut-plans-may-depend-savings-medicaid-what-it-and-who-relies-it" target="_blank">the state-federal health program</a> for lower-income people and some people with disabilities.</p><p dir="ltr">“We are working, you know, feverishly with our colleagues and teams to mitigate that number,” Alexis McGill Johnson, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said. “We have to remember 50% of Planned Parenthood patients use Medicaid for their health care insurance. And so that is a very meaningful impact to the health centers that also rely on reimbursement in the same way every other single health care provider relies on reimbursement for the services provided.” </p><h4>GOP law targets Planned Parenthood</h4><p dir="ltr">Federal law for decades has barred funding from going toward abortion services with limited exceptions for rape, incest, or the life of the pregnant patient. </p><p dir="ltr">Earlier this year, Republicans in Congress included a provision in their “big, beautiful” law that prevents Medicaid funding from going to certain health care organizations that provide abortions and received more than $800,000 in reimbursements from the program during a recent fiscal year. </p><p dir="ltr">The language, which originally applied for 10 years but was reduced to one year in the final version of the bill, appeared to specifically target Planned Parenthood. It prevents the organization from receiving any Medicaid funding for health care services unrelated to abortion, like annual physicals, cancer screenings and STI testing.</p><p dir="ltr">Planned Parenthood <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/planned-parenthood-sues-trump-administration-officials-over-defunding-provision-budget-bill" target="_blank">quickly filed a lawsuit</a> in the federal district court in Massachusetts in July, shortly after President Donald Trump signed the legislation.  </p><p dir="ltr">A district court judge <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/federal-judge-quickly-rules-favor-planned-parenthood-suit-over-medicaid-funding" target="_blank">issued a temporary restraining order</a> and then <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/one-big-beautiful-law-provision-planned-parenthood-funding-partly-blocked-judge" target="_blank">a preliminary injunction</a> that month, blocking the Department of Health and Human Services from implementing that one aspect of the law and allowing Medicaid patients to continue going to Planned Parenthood for routine health care services.</p><p dir="ltr">On Thursday, a three-judge panel from the U.S. 1st Circuit Court of Appeals <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/appeals-court-allows-provision-freezing-medicaid-funding-planned-parenthood" target="_blank">overturned the lower court’s ruling</a>, clearing the way for the Trump administration to stop reimbursing Planned Parenthood for Medicaid patients while the case continues. </p><p dir="ltr">Peyton Humphreville, senior staff attorney at Planned Parenthood Federation of America and one of the lawyers handling the lawsuit, said on a call with reporters Friday the organization is evaluating all of its options but doesn’t expect additional rulings until later this year at the earliest. </p><p dir="ltr">“The 1st Circuit Court of Appeals has entered a briefing schedule on the preliminary injunction appeal that will be fully briefed by mid-November,” Humphreville said. “From there, the court will schedule oral argument and will at some point after the oral argument rule on the preliminary injunction appeal.”</p> </div>
