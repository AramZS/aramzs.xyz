<p>Perhaps the most legendary piece of plastic in the hacker community is the humble <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Draper">"Cap'n Crunch" whistle</a>. The free-in-cereal whistle was able to emit a piercing shriek at 2600Hz - the exact tone required to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2600_hertz#2600_Hz">unlock the US phone network</a>.</p>
<p>So, because it's all I seem to do these days, I turned my my trusty RepRapPro and decided to see whether it was possible to 3D print a whistle which could produce the same frequency.</p>
<p>I found a <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:46825">customisable whistle on Thingiverse</a> and customised it to include the <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:157457">Over The Air hashtag</a>.</p>
<p>Rather than do any funky customisations with radius or length, I simply scaled the whistle in Slic3r.</p>

<p>I made them at 75%, 85%, 100%, and 100%.</p>
<p>The print wasn't without issues. Because of the large opening, the top layer didn't seal properly - even on the smallest print.</p>
<figure><img alt="Whistle Holes" src="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Whistle-Holes.jpg"/><figcaption>Whistle Holes</figcaption></figure>
<p>The logo printed reasonably well - and the holes in the side were easily sealed with my fingers. But I might adjust the model for a thicker top layer.</p>
<p>The models come with an integrated "pea". The little ball in printed inside the barrel - a hard poke with a sharp stick set the ball free.</p>
<p>So, how did it sound?</p>

<p>Not bad! We broke out a tonal analyser on a smartphone and, on the smallest whistle, I managed to just about hit 2600Hz!</p>

<p>The 3D print is rather rough and was quite harsh on the lips - so it's worth sanding the final print down or rubbing some acetone on it before blowing.</p>
<p>Now, obviously, this doesn't look exactly like the original whistle. There are no 3D models I could find - although there are several rather detailed photos.</p>

<p>For my next step I can go one of two ways. Either refine the existing whistle so it reliably produces the 2600Hz tone - or try to make a replica of the bo'sun whistle and then get that pitch perfect. Thoughts?</p>
<p>Oh, and the tone is <em>really</em> loud and annoying for anyone nearby!</p>
