<p>Whether they appear in a yellow lined notebook or on white printer paper, government documents are government documents.</p>
<p>The color of the paper doesn’t change that the public has a right to the information. The words on the page could reveal recent violations, annual spending or a new proposal. And if the yellow lined paper becomes a text message? Well, the information hasn’t changed. And, <a href="https://www.cleveland.com/news/2025/07/gov-mike-dewine-signs-measure-allowing-ohio-lawmakers-to-shield-texts-emails-from-public-view.html">usually</a>, neither has the public’s right to know.</p>
<p>Text messages are <a href="https://www.muckrock.com/news/archives/2017/jan/27/whats-public-record/">public records</a>. Yet even the advanced FOIA user can get tied into knots around public records and texts. Texts are one of the most private areas of our lives. No one else reads our text messages. Most of the time, we don’t even read our text messages.</p>
<p>The feeling that emails (the close cousin of texting and a <a href="https://www.muckrock.com/news/archives/2025/apr/02/using-foia-for-emails/">common FOIA request</a>) are less private than texts is self-evident. You conduct business over email, you don’t send pictures of your dog to everyone. Your work email sits on server space owned by your employer.</p>
<p>But if you’re a public employee conducting public business, email and text messaging are just the white and yellow lined paper of digital communications.</p>
<p>Clearing up this confusion over text messages gets to the heart of public records law. Public records are public based on <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2018/07/18/remember-public-officials-your-texts-are-public-records/">the content of the information</a>, not the format. <a href="https://www.archives.gov/records-mgmt/scheduling/id">The Federal Records Act defines records</a> “regardless of physical form or characteristics,” and <a href="https://www.rcfp.org/open-government-sections/7-text-messages-and-other-electronic-messages/">several states have adopted similar language</a> in their public records laws.</p>
<p>Still, there are some challenges that can make requesting text messages more difficult than other public records. You may even <a href="https://www.muckrock.com/news/archives/2017/may/04/seattle-text-messages-phone/">end up with a photocopied phone</a>. This guide will help you prepare for these challenges and navigate them.</p>

<h2>How to file a request for text messages</h2>
<p>The wording in a request for text messages is straightforward. You can include “text messages” in a list of other types of communications, like emails or memos, and include <a href="https://www.muckrock.com/foi/stickney-10983/jeff-walik-emails-157611/">anyone you think might be on the thread</a> as “sent to, from or cc’d.”</p>
<blockquote> <p>“All communications, including but not limited to emails, text messages, voicemails and memos, sent to, from or cc’d …” </p> </blockquote>
<p>Or you can request text messages without other types of communications, <a href="https://www.muckrock.com/foi/new-york-city-17/text-messages-sent-by-deputy-mayor-philip-banks-145346/">like Reuters editor Ben Welsh</a>, who requested all “text messages sent on public phones and devices” by New York City’s deputy mayor during a three-day period.</p>
<p>The process of searching for texts to hand over is where things get more complicated.</p>
<h2>Where are text messages stored?</h2>
<p>Unlike some government records, text messages don’t hang out in an office cabinet or on top of a desk. And unlike emails, they aren’t stored in the Cloud or on a server by default. The location of text messages adds a twist to how they are retrieved.</p>
<p>In FOIA lingo, the storage process of documents is called “records retention.” Records retention concerns the location and length of time a government agency should keep a record. Not all records are kept in perpetuity. <a href="https://www.archives.gov/records-mgmt/scheduling">Plans for how a record will be archived and eventually disposed of</a> are called a “records retention schedule.”</p>
<p>Like the question of what a public record is, how long an agency keeps a record is shaped by the content of the record, not the format. As <a href="https://www.archives.gov/records-mgmt/faqs/general.html">the federal government’s expert in managing information</a> and records, the National Archives lists documents like budgeting and employment ethics records<a href="https://www.archives.gov/records-mgmt/grs.html"> among its common retention categories</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.archives.gov/records-mgmt/bulletins/2015/2015-02.html">The National Archives guidance</a> for federal agencies is to treat text messages like other communications, and <a href="https://www.archives.gov/records-mgmt/bulletins/2013/2013-02.html">designate one employee as the “capstone”</a> or most important overlap of communication. Once the capstone employee is decided, all their communications are stored permanently. The National Archives also recommends that <a href="https://www.archives.gov/records-mgmt/bulletins/2015/2015-02.html">agencies have a policy for capturing texts</a> that are public records, train employees on recognizing public records on personal devices and use a third-party backup system to backup messages.</p>
<p>In practice, archiving text messages is more complicated. On personal devices, the National Archives <a href="https://www.archives.gov/records-mgmt/bulletins/2015/2015-02.html">suggests that </a><a href="https://www.archives.gov/records-mgmt/bulletins/2015/2015-02.html">employees should be trained</a> to sort public business from private, but that’s almost impossible to enforce. Government-issued devices could be part of an agency’s backup system, but if not, texts would only be stored on individual devices. There’s no one-size-fits-all answer for where and how long text messages at an agency will be stored. Some agencies could have a system for archiving messages, others could leave it up to the employee to manage their paper trail.</p>
<h2>How does the agency search for the text messages?</h2>
<p>In <a href="https://www.open-dc.gov/FOIA_AdvisoryOpinion_TextMessages">an opinion on Washington D.C.’s FOIA law and text messaging</a>, D.C.’s Office of Open Government recommended three ways to anticipate the challenges of searching text messages:</p>
<ul> <li> <p>Discourage employees from texting on their personal devices </p> </li> <li> <p>Require an employee using a personal device to separate messages about public business </p> </li> <li> <p>Require employees to submit a sworn statement about their search for messages on personal devices </p> </li> </ul>
<p>When the phone is issued by the government, the agency can more easily set up systems to retain and archive all texts on the phone. <a href="https://www.smarsh.com/about-us">Technology vendors</a> help agencies <a href="https://www.smarsh.com/blog/government-gap-in-archiving-text-messages/">with electronic communications archiving</a> and search.</p>
<p>If the texts aren’t backed up to an agency-wide system, the employee could either be asked to search their own phone or hand it over for someone else to search. In Washington state, a court ordered a <a href="https://www.thenewstribune.com/news/politics-government/article32533455.html">county prosecutor to search his personal phone </a>and submit texts to the county for review. In cases where an employee is searching their own phone, they could be asked to submit a sworn statement about their search for responsive records.</p>
<h2>Disappearing messages</h2>
<p>In the last several years, apps like Signal and WhatsApp have popularized features that destroy messages after a short period of time. Luckily, the upshot of this practice is less complicated than searching for text messages. If the texts contain public business, using self-destructing message apps breaks public records laws and undermines transparency.</p>
<p>Last year, the San Francisco mayor’s office came under scrutiny for a decade-long practice of allowing the mayor to delete texts, <a href="https://missionlocal.org/2024/09/mayor-breed-is-deleting-texts-legal-experts-say-thats-a-problem/">flouting California public records law</a>. After the Washington Post <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2021/12/30/hogan-wickr-messages-disappear/">uncovered that former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan had used a self-destructing text message app</a>, Maryland lawmakers <a href="https://mgaleg.maryland.gov/mgawebsite/Legislation/Details/hb0395?ys=2022RS&amp;search=True">introduced legislation</a> to require the governor’s office to <a href="https://statescoop.com/encrypted-messaging-maryland-gov-hogan/">retain all electronic communications</a>.</p>
<p>In 2022, <a href="https://www.open-dc.gov/FOIA_AdvisoryOpinion_TextMessages">D.C.’s Office of Open Government asked the District</a> to prohibit the use of auto-deleting technologies.</p>
<h2>So you got the texts</h2>
<p>If your request is successful then, as the kids say, <a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2016/07/how-show-me-the-receipts-became-a-catchphrase-for-holding-the-powerful-accountable.html">you have the receipts</a>. Once you receive the messages, you can share them with the public like Connecticut Mirror reporters Katy Golvala and Ginny Monk. While reporting on a policy addressing racial inequality in the state, Golvala and Monk <a href="https://ctmirror.org/2023/01/01/ct-baby-bonds-money-ned-lamont-shawn-wooden/">received and published texts about the policy</a>, including trenchant musings on its future from the state’s now former comptroller: “Lol @ baby bonds we’ll fix that.”</p>
