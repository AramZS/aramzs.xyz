<p>Earlier this month, <strong>Marc Elias</strong>, the prominent Democratic lawyer turned media entrepreneur, was at his home just outside <strong>Washington</strong> when the milestone arrived. The outlet he founded in 2020,<strong> Democracy Docket</strong>—a <a href="https://www.democracydocket.com">digital news organization</a> that covers voting rights, elections, and the courts from an unapologetically pro-democracy standpoint—had been inching toward 50,000 paid subscribers. The team didn’t expect to cross that line until after <strong>Labor Day</strong>. But a stronger-than-anticipated August put the number suddenly within reach, only 17 months after launching a premium membership program.</p>
<p>“Every day I would ask, ‘When do we think we’re going to hit it?’” Elias told me by phone on Thursday.</p>
<p>Then, on Wednesday, August 13, his phone buzzed with a text from managing director <strong>Allie Rothenberg</strong>. She sent a screen shot showing the paid subscriber tally at exactly 50,000. Elias, describing it to me as a “momentous and meaningful” marker, immediately emailed the team with the news. Two weeks later, Democracy Docket celebrated again, this time surpassing 500,000 subscribers on <strong>YouTube</strong>.</p>
<p>For Elias, the success has been vindicating. From the start, he believed there was a sizable audience hungry for in-depth coverage of the legal and political battles shaping American elections. “When Democracy Docket started,” Elias recalled, “I’d tell people, ‘I’m going to build a media company.’ And they’d shoot back, ‘You’re definitely not going to do that.’ And I’d respond, ‘No, I am.’”</p>
<p>Today, Democracy Docket is thriving. At $120 per year, its 50,000 subscribers translate to…</p>

<p><strong><em>Targeting the Trans: </em></strong>One day after the deadly shooting at a <strong>Catholic</strong> school in <strong>Minneapolis</strong>, right-wing media turned up the anti-trans rhetoric, weaponizing the suspect’s gender identity against the entire community. Outlets and personalities sought to frame the violence as proof that transgender people pose a public threat. That line of attack (shamefully) reached the <strong>White House</strong> briefing room on Thursday, when a <strong>Daily Wire </strong>figure <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/atrupar.com/post/3lxi3sx5fqn2g">pressed</a> press secretary <strong>Karoline Leavitt</strong> on whether the <strong>FBI</strong> should “institute a new class of domestic terrorism that involves trans ideology.” The same individual asked if the administration would support such a move. Leavitt replied she would need to “check with the appropriate people.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <strong>Fox News</strong> got in on the action, with <strong>Laura Ingraham </strong>railing against what she called the “trans cult” and airing banners like: “TRANS MAINSTREAMING, TRAGIC RESULTS.” And across the right-wing ecosystem, sites such as <strong>Breitbart</strong> and<strong> The Gateway Pundit</strong> emphasized the suspect’s gender identity and linked it to the horrific violence, as if identity itself were responsible.</p>
<ul><li><p>👁️<em> Turning a blind eye:</em> While <strong>CNN</strong> and <strong>MSNBC</strong> led their prime time programming with the disturbing exodus playing out at the <strong>CDC</strong>, <strong>Fox News </strong>largely opted to turn a blind eye to the situation, only briefly covering the situation from a vantage point sympathetic to the <strong>White House</strong>.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Matt Gertz </strong>wrote about how Fox News let <strong>Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</strong> spin on <strong>"Fox &amp; Friends"</strong>: "There are fewer senior leaders at CDC to stand up to Kennedy and his conspiracy theories. And after this morning, we can expect Fox to be in his corner."
