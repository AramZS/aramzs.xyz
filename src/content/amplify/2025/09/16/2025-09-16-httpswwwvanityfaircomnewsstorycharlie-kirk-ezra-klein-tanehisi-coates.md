<p>Before he was killed last week, <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/charlie-kirk-killing-political-violence?srsltid=AfmBOop2zv-CG4hFuILVg2mVh1PHjvCNeYhkpzhBX5vKt7q7-lnWE33_">Charlie Kirk</a> left a helpful compendium of words—ones that would greatly aid those who sought to understand his legacy and import. It is somewhat difficult to match these words with the manner in which Kirk is presently being memorialized in mainstream discourse. <em>New York Times</em> columnist <strong>Ezra Klein</strong> <a data-event-boundary="click" data-event-click='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-in-view='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-include-experiments="true" data-offer-url="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/11/opinion/charlie-kirk-assassination-fear-politics.html" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/11/opinion/charlie-kirk-assassination-fear-politics.html">dubbed Kirk</a> “one of the era’s most effective practitioners of persuasion” and a man who “was practicing politics in exactly the right way.” California governor <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/charlie-kirk-new-media-ecosystem?srsltid=AfmBOooO6oP6f1YS29vijmhIEa415JZPg9AqNUkye5wBhwqz8A_VEWc7"><strong>Gavin Newsom</strong></a> hailed Kirk’s “passion and commitment to debate,” advising us to continue Kirk’s work by engaging “with each other, across ideology, through spirited discourse.” <em>Atlantic</em> writer <strong>Sally Jenkins</strong> <a data-event-boundary="click" data-event-click='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-in-view='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-include-experiments="true" data-offer-url="https://bsky.app/profile/sallyjenx.bsky.social/post/3lyptbfcmpk2w" href="https://bsky.app/profile/sallyjenx.bsky.social/post/3lyptbfcmpk2w">saluted Kirk</a>, claiming he “argued with civility” and asserting that his death <a data-event-boundary="click" data-event-click='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-in-view='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-include-experiments="true" data-offer-url="https://bsky.app/profile/patrickhruby.bsky.social/post/3lypsxldso22n" href="https://bsky.app/profile/patrickhruby.bsky.social/post/3lypsxldso22n">was</a> “a significant loss for those who believe engagement can help bridge disagreements.”</p>
<p>The mentions of “debate” and “engagement” are references to Kirk’s campus tours, during which he visited various colleges to take on whoever come may. That this aspect of Kirk’s work would be so attractive to writers and politicians is understandable. There is, after all, a pervasive worry, among the political class, that college students, ensconced in their own bubbles, could use a bit of shock therapy from a man unconcerned with preferred pronouns, trigger warnings, and the humanity of Palestinians. But it also shows how the political class’s obsession with universities blinds it to everything else. And the everything-else of Kirk’s politics amounted to little more than a loathing of those whose mere existence provoked his ire.</p>

<p>It is not just, for instance, that Kirk held disagreeable views—that he was pro-life, that he <a data-event-boundary="click" data-event-click='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-in-view='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-include-experiments="true" data-offer-url="https://ca.news.yahoo.com/charlie-kirk-actually-said-whether-213400821.html" href="https://ca.news.yahoo.com/charlie-kirk-actually-said-whether-213400821.html">believed in public executions</a>, or that he rejected the <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/charlie-kirk/charlie-kirk-there-no-separation-church-and-state">separation of church and state</a>. It’s that Kirk reveled in open bigotry. Indeed, claims of Kirk’s “civility” are tough to square with his penchant for demeaning members of the LGBTQ+ community <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/charlie-kirk/charlie-kirk-uses-slur-refer-transgender-tiktok-influencer">as “freaks”</a> and <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/charlie-kirk/charlie-kirk-uses-slur-refer-transgender-tiktok-influencer">referring to trans people</a> <a href="http://google.com/url?q=https://www.mediamatters.org/charlie-kirk/bout-nostalgia-90s-tpusa-founder-charlie-kirk-says-anti-trans-slur-youtube&amp;sa=D&amp;source=docs&amp;ust=1758036295707249&amp;usg=AOvVaw0aRN997BsbgHwJsNkmz1Ei">with the slur</a> “tranny.” Faced with the prospect of a <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/topic/kamala-harris?srsltid=AfmBOoq0-is9L2c1geK3_zAyGJbPxVfnzYkBAR98cERH8Sf4bGt958Zd"><strong>Kamala Harris</strong></a> presidency, Kirk told his audience that the threat had to be averted because Harris wanted to “<a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/charlie-kirk/charlie-kirk-kamala-harris-seeks-kidnap-your-child-trans-agenda">kidnap your child via the trans agenda</a>.” Garden-variety transphobia is sadly unremarkable. But Kirk was a master of folding seemingly discordant bigotries into each other, as when he defined “<a data-event-boundary="click" data-event-click='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-in-view='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-include-experiments="true" data-offer-url="https://x.com/WallStreetApes/status/1965144047368241313" href="https://x.com/WallStreetApes/status/1965144047368241313">the American way of life</a>” as marriage, home ownership, and child-rearing free of “the lesbian, gay, transgender garbage in their school,” adding that he did not want kids to “have to hear the Muslim call to prayer five times a day.” The American way of life was “Christendom,” Kirk claimed, and Islam—“<a data-event-boundary="click" data-event-click='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-in-view='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-include-experiments="true" data-offer-url="https://x.com/charliekirk11/status/1965281328108343507" href="https://x.com/charliekirk11/status/1965281328108343507">the sword the left is using to slit the throat of America</a>”—was antithetical to that. Large “dedicated” Islamic areas were “<a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/charlie-kirk/charlie-kirk-large-dedicated-islamic-areas-are-threat-america">a threat to America</a>,” Kirk asserted, and New York mayoral candidate <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/how-gen-z-is-powering-the-race-for-new-york-city-mayor?srsltid=AfmBOoqESNS85N37O16r9_W6UU0glsCsZXcapCLQLTUU7_RT7CDkeNtK"><strong>Zohran Mamdani</strong></a> was a “<a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/media/4032192">Mohammedan</a>,” with Kirk supposing that anyone trying to see “Mohammedism take over the West” would love to have New York—a “prior Anglo center”—“under Mohammedan rule.”</p>
<p>Kirk <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/charlie-kirk/charlie-kirk-black-crime-major-issue-our-country">habitually</a> <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/charlie-kirk/charlie-kirk-affirmative-action-does-not-address-real-problem-black-crime-and-black">railed against</a> “<a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/fox-friends/charlie-kirk-blames-chicago-gun-violence-lack-father-problem-black-community">Black crime</a>,” claiming that “<a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/charlie-kirk/charlie-kirk-goes-unhinged-racist-rant-prowling-blacks-go-around-fun-go-target-white">prowling Blacks go around for fun to go target white people</a>.” He repeated the rape accusations against <strong>Yusef Salaam,</strong> a member of the exonerated Central Park Five who is now a New York City councilman, calling him a “<a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/charlie-kirk/charlie-kirk-makes-false-accusations-about-exonerated-central-park-five-defendant-and">disgusting pig</a>” who had gotten away with “gang rape.” Whatever distaste Kirk held for Blacks was multiplied when he turned to those from Haiti. Haiti was, by Kirk’s lights, a country “<a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/charlie-kirk/charlie-kirk-haiti-legitimately-infested-demonic-voodoo-allows-practitioners-do-quasi">infested with demonic voodoo</a>,” whose migrants were “<a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/charlie-kirk/charlie-kirk-warns-haitian-migrants-will-become-your-masters-if-trump-loses-election">raping your women and hunting you down at night</a>.” These Haitians, as well as undocumented immigrants from other countries, were “having a field day,” per Kirk, and “coming for your daughter next.” The only hope was <strong><a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/topic/donald-trump?srsltid=AfmBOooOCjgMf0DUVWSJZjR4A_q25S2ctfETQP7Geg6xvOw2evCvg0fU">Donald Trump</a>,</strong> who had to prevail, lest Haitians “become your masters.”</p>

<p>The point of this so-called mastery was as familiar as it was conspiratorial—“great replacement.” There was an “<a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/charlie-kirk/charlie-kirk-southern-border-course-great-replacement-theyre-trying-replace-us">anti-white agenda</a>,” Kirk howled. One that sought to “make the country more like the Third World.” The southern border was “the dumping ground of the planet,” he claimed, and a magnet for “the rapists, the thugs, the murderers, fighting-age males.” “They’re coming from across the world, from China, from Russia, from Middle Eastern countries,” he said, “and they’re coming in and they’re coming in and they’re coming in and they’re coming in…”</p>
<p>You can probably imagine where this line of thinking eventually went.</p>
<p>“Jewish donors,” <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/media/4013084">Kirk claimed</a>, were “the number one funding mechanism of radical open-border, neoliberal, quasi-Marxist policies, cultural institutions, and nonprofits.” <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/charlie-kirk/charlie-kirk-defends-elon-musks-antisemitism-some-largest-financiers-left-wing-anti">Indeed</a>, “the philosophical foundation of anti-whiteness has been largely financed by Jewish donors in the country.”</p>

<p>Kirk’s bigotry was not personal, but extended to the institution he founded, Turning Point USA. <strong>Crystal Clanton,</strong> the group’s former national field director, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/a-conservative-nonprofit-that-seeks-to-transform-college-campuses-faces-allegations-of-racial-bias-and-illegal-campaign-activity?reload=true">once texted</a> a fellow Turning Point employee, “I HATE BLACK PEOPLE. Like fuck them all … I hate blacks. End of story.” One of the group’s advisers, <strong>Rip McIntosh,</strong> <a data-event-boundary="click" data-event-click='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-in-view='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-include-experiments="true" data-offer-url="https://www.informant.news/rip-mcintosh-tpusa-racist-newsletter/" href="https://www.informant.news/rip-mcintosh-tpusa-racist-newsletter/">once published a newsletter featuring an essay from a pseudonymous writer that said Blacks</a> had “become socially incompatible with other races” and that Black culture was an “un-fixable and crime-ridden mess.” In 2022, after three Black <a data-event-boundary="click" data-event-click='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-in-view='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-include-experiments="true" data-offer-url="https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/38863562/virginia-football-shooting-anniversary-three-legacies-live-on" href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/38863562/virginia-football-shooting-anniversary-three-legacies-live-on">football players were killed at another college</a>, <strong>Meg Miller,</strong> president of Turning Point’s chapter at the University of Missouri, <a data-event-boundary="click" data-event-click='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-in-view='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-include-experiments="true" data-offer-url="https://kansascitydefender.com/justice/white-mizzou-student-racism-kill-n-word/" href="https://kansascitydefender.com/justice/white-mizzou-student-racism-kill-n-word/">joked</a> (“joked”) in a social media message, “If they would have killed 4 more n-ggers we would have had the whole week off.”</p>
<p>Kirk subscribed to some of the most disreputable and harmful beliefs that this country has ever known. But it is still chilling to think that those beliefs would be silenced by a gunshot. The tragedy is personal—Kirk was robbed of his life, and his children and family will forever live with the knowledge that a visual record of that robbery is just an internet search away. And the tragedy is national. Political violence ends conversation and invites war; its rejection is paramount to a functioning democracy and a free society. “Political violence is a virus,” Klein noted. This assertion is true. It is also at odds with Kirk’s own words. It’s not that Kirk merely, as Klein put it, “defended the Second Amendment”—it’s that Kirk endorsed hurting people to advance his preferred policy outcomes.</p>
<p>In 2022, when Kirk was frustrated, for instance, by the presence of <strong>Lia Thomas</strong> on the University of Pennsylvania women’s swim team, Kirk did not call for “spirited discourse.” Instead, while discussing a recent championship tournament, he said he would have liked to have seen a group of fathers <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/charlie-kirk/youtube-charlie-kirk-calls-men-confront-and-physically-prevent-trans-student-athletes">descend from the stands</a>, forming “a line in front of [Lia] Thomas and saying, ‘Hey, tough guy, you want to get in the pool? ’Cause you’re gonna have to come through us.” Mere weeks before his death, Kirk reveled in Trump’s deployment of federal troops to DC. “Shock and awe. Force,” <a data-event-boundary="click" data-event-click='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-in-view='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-include-experiments="true" data-offer-url="https://x.com/charliekirk11/status/1958565497869389840" href="https://x.com/charliekirk11/status/1958565497869389840">he wrote</a>. “We’re taking our country back from these cockroaches.” And in 2023, Kirk told his audience that then president <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/topic/joe-biden?srsltid=AfmBOopdhcLsc36tSaba5Rpa7Ij0mOetapD2nM-2hvF7mE3pyiGXiAT3"><strong>Joe Biden</strong></a> was a “corrupt tyrant” who should be “put in prison <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/charlie-kirk/charlie-kirk-joe-biden-should-be-put-prison-andor-given-death-penalty-crimes-against">and/or given the death penalty</a> for his crimes against America.”</p>

<p>What are we to make of a man who called for the execution of the American president, and then was executed himself? What are we to make of an NFL that, on one hand, encourages us to “<a data-event-boundary="click" data-event-click='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-in-view='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-include-experiments="true" data-offer-url="https://www.nfl.com/news/nfl-teams-will-again-stencil-messages-in-end-zone-including-end-racism-and-choose-love" href="https://www.nfl.com/news/nfl-teams-will-again-stencil-messages-in-end-zone-including-end-racism-and-choose-love">End Racism</a>,” and, on the other, urges us <a data-event-boundary="click" data-event-click='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-in-view='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-include-experiments="true" data-offer-url="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6624434/2025/09/12/nfl-decision-explanation-charlie-kirk-moment-of-silence/" href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6624434/2025/09/12/nfl-decision-explanation-charlie-kirk-moment-of-silence/">to commemorate</a> an unreconstructed white supremacist? And what of the writers, the thinkers, and the pundits who cannot separate the great crime of Kirk’s death from the malignancy of his public life? Can they truly be so ignorant to the words of a man they have so rushed to memorialize? I don’t know. But the most telling detail in Klein’s column was that, for all his praise, there was not a single word in the piece from Kirk himself.</p>
<p>More than a century and a half ago, this country <a data-event-boundary="click" data-event-click='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-in-view='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-include-experiments="true" data-offer-url="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/06/what-this-cruel-war-was-over/396482/" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/06/what-this-cruel-war-was-over/396482/">ignored the explicit words</a> of men who sought to raise an empire of slavery. It subsequently transformed those men into gallant knights who sought only to preserve their beloved Camelot. There was a fatigue, in certain quarters, with Reconstruction—which is to say, multiracial democracy—and a desire for reunion, to make America great again. Thus, in the late 19th century and much of the 20th, this country’s most storied intellectuals transfigured hate-mongers into heroes and ignored their words—just as, right now, some are ignoring Kirk’s.</p>
<p>Words are not violence, nor are they powerless. Burying the truth of the Confederacy, rewriting its aims and ideas, and ignoring its animating words allowed for the terrorization of the Black population, the imposition of apartheid, and the destruction of democracy. The rewriting and the ignoring were done not just by Confederates, but also by putative allies for whom the reduction of Black people to serfdom was the unfortunate price of white unity. The import of this history has never been clearer than in this moment when the hard question must be asked: If you would look away from the words of Charlie Kirk, from what else would you look away?</p>
