<p>Meta's HUD glasses with sEMG wristband will in fact be Ray-Ban branded, a leaked clip which also depicts the HUD and wristband in action reveals.</p>
<p>An <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KukUa4x51Yc&amp;ref=uploadvr.com">unlisted video</a> on Meta's YouTube channel titled "Many Looks. Infinite Capabilities" shows Meta and EssilorLuxottica's upcoming full lineup: the regular Ray-Ban Meta glasses, the <a href="https://www.uploadvr.com/oakley-meta-hstn-glasses-now-shipping/">Oakley Meta HSTN glasses</a>, the rumored Oakley Sphaera glasses, and the rumored HUD glasses with sEMG wristband, which are labeled as "Meta | Ray-Ban" with the word "Display" underneath.</p>
<p>The clip shows the heads-up display (HUD) being used for Meta AI and on-foot navigation, as well as the wristband being used to <a href="https://www.uploadvr.com/meta-semg-wristband-gestures-nature-paper/">finger-swipe</a> letters on a surface to respond to a message.</p>

<p>That Meta is launching smart glasses with a HUD controlled by an sEMG wristband at Connect 2025 is <a href="https://www.uploadvr.com/meta-connect-2025-predictions-expectations/">not a surprise</a>. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, The Verge, The Information, The Financial Times, and CNBC have all reported that Meta intends to release such a device, and in July, renders of it and its wristband <a href="https://www.uploadvr.com/meta-celeste-hud-glasses-name-design-emg-wristband-gestures-leak/">were discovered</a> in early firmware.</p>
<p>But what is somewhat of a surprise is that they will be Ray-Ban branded.</p>
