<div><div><p>Utah County prosecutors on Tuesday charged <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/charlie-kirk-shooting-suspect-identified-as-22-year-old-utah-man-tyler-robinson/">Tyler Robinson</a> in the shooting death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University, a murder officials say was politically motivated. They intend to seek the death penalty.</p><p>Utah County attorney Jeff Gray announced <a data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26098852-tyler-robinson-indictment/"}' data-offer-url="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26098852-tyler-robinson-indictment/" href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26098852-tyler-robinson-indictment/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">the indictment</a> at a midday news conference, listing charges of aggravated murder, felony discharge of a firearm causing serious bodily injury, and commission of a violent offense in the presence of a child. Robinson, 22, is also charged with two counts of obstruction and two counts of witness tampering.</p><p></p><p></p><p>“Charlie Kirk was murdered while engaging in one of our most sacred and cherished American rights,” Gray said. “The bedrock of our democratic republic is the free exchange of ideas in a search for truth, understanding, and a more perfect union.”</p><p></p><p>Gray said that the murder was considered an aggravated offense because it was believed to be motivated by the victim’s political expression. On the matter of the death penalty, he added: “I do not take this decision lightly, and it is a decision I have made independently as county attorney based solely on the available evidence and circumstances and nature of the crime.”</p><p>Robinson will make his first court appearance at 3 pm MST on Tuesday.</p><p>Kirk, 31, was fatally shot on September 10 while taking questions from students. The cofounder of Turning Point USA, he was credited with galvanizing young conservatives and playing a pivotal role in Donald Trump’s 2024 White House return.</p><p>The shooting sparked <a data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.sltrib.com/news/2025/09/16/charlie-kirk-shooting-uvu-alerts/"}' data-offer-url="https://www.sltrib.com/news/2025/09/16/charlie-kirk-shooting-uvu-alerts/" href="https://www.sltrib.com/news/2025/09/16/charlie-kirk-shooting-uvu-alerts/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">chaos on campus</a>, where delayed and contradictory emergency alerts left many students and faculty scrambling in confusion. Vigils for Kirk have since been held in Arizona, New York, and Washington, among other states. Across the US, Kirk’s murder has become both a rallying cry for <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/right-wing-activists-are-targeting-people-for-allegedly-celebrating-charlie-kirks-death/">far-right retribution</a> and fuel for an <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/after-charlie-kirks-death-trump-team-calls-dismantling-leftist-groups-2025-09-16/">assault on civil society</a>.</p><p>Investigators claim forensic evidence links Robinson to the shooting, with FBI director Kash Patel telling <em>Fox &amp; Friends</em> that matching DNA was found on a towel wrapped around the rifle and on a screwdriver recovered from the rooftop where the fatal shot was fired. Patel also said investigators believe Robinson wrote a note of his alleged intent to kill Kirk, bolstering claims the attack was premeditated.</p><p>An indictment <a data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/26098838/tyler-robinson-indictment.pdf"}' data-offer-url="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/26098838/tyler-robinson-indictment.pdf" href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/26098838/tyler-robinson-indictment.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">released Tuesday</a> adds vivid details to the allegations. Prosecutors say surveillance footage captured Robinson climbing onto a campus rooftop, lying prone in a “sniper position,” and firing from nearly 160 yards away. Investigators recovered cartridges at the scene with hand-engraved messages, which prosecutors argue points to premeditation and motive.</p><p>Prosecutors also cited interviews with Robinson’s parents and roommate, who said he expressed anger that Kirk “spreads too much hate” and admitted he had “enough of his hatred.” The filing further alleges that Robinson told his roommate to stay silent if approached by police, and that children were visible near the stage when Kirk was shot—factors prosecutors say aggravated the seriousness of the crime.</p><p>Investigators are also scrutinizing Robinson’s <a data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2025/09/15/charlie-kirk-shooter-suspect-discord-chat/"}' data-offer-url="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2025/09/15/charlie-kirk-shooter-suspect-discord-chat/" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2025/09/15/charlie-kirk-shooter-suspect-discord-chat/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">digital footprint</a>.
