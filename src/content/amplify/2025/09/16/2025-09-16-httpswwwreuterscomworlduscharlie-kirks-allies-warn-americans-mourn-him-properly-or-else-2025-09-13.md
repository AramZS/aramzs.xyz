  A smattering of commentators – including ordinary people joking about and
  sometimes celebrating Kirk's death to lawmakers and pundits dwelling on his
  history of bigoted rhetoric – has also surfaced, only to be targeted in
  organized campaigns.

Calls to run people out of jobs have flooded across X. A newly registered site, "Expose Charlie's Murderers," has 41 names of people it alleged were “supporting political violence online” and claims to be working on a backlog of more than 20,000 submissions.</p><p>A Reuters review of the screenshots and comments posted to the site shows that some of those featured joked about or celebrated Kirk's death. One was quoted as saying, "He got what he deserved" and others were quoted providing variations on "karma's a bitch." Others, however, were critical of the far-right figure while explicitly denouncing violence.</p><p>Still others appear to have done little more than point out that a longtime gun control foe had been shot to death. At least three accurately quoted Kirk's 2023 comments in which he told a crowd that some gun deaths were "worth it,” saying that the annual drumbeat of firearms-related killings in the United States was "a prudent deal" in exchange for the Constitution's Second Amendment.</p><p>One person who was featured on the site said their employer had been bombarded by phone calls, with callers threatening not to let up until they were fired or disciplined. The person said they plan to avoid the office in the coming days.</p><p>“To be very, very clear, I don’t condone the murder of Charlie Kirk,” the person told Reuters in a phone call, speaking on condition of anonymity to avoid further harassment. “But I do, at the same time, have to appreciate the irony of this situation,” they said, referring to Kirk being shot through the neck with a rifle following years of vociferous opposition to gun control.</p><p>Reuters could not establish who is running the website. The site did not respond to questions about its ownership, methodology, or why quoting Kirk accurately could be seen as "supporting political violence." Squarespace, the site's host, did not return messages seeking comment.</p><p>Jay Childers, an associate professor of communications at the University of Kansas, said there was a long history of government officials and political elites attempting to control rhetoric and suppress dissent.</p><p>“I do not think this moment is really new in that sense," he said, although he noted that "the ability for anyone to post their thoughts on the internet certainly makes far more people potential targets of any attempts to control political speech.”</p><div><p>Reporting by Raphael Satter; Editing by Paul Thomasch and Mark Porter</p></div><nav aria-label="Tags"></nav><p></p><div><address><p>Reporter covering cybersecurity, surveillance, and disinformation for Reuters.
