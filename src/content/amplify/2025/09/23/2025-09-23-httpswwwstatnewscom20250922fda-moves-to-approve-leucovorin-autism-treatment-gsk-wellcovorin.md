<p>In a highly unusual move, the Food and Drug Administration re-approved a drug on Monday that stopped being sold more than 25 years ago, part of a push from the Trump administration to identify the causes of and potential treatments for autism.</p>
<p>The drug, GSK’s Wellcovorin, is a branded version of leucovorin, a widely available generic drug that’s generally used to help tame the side effects of drugs, including certain cancer treatments. President Trump and his health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., on Monday announced that the administration is exploring leucovorin as an autism therapy. Health officials also said that Tylenol use during pregnancy could cause autism.</p>
<p>Wellcovorin was originally approved in 1983, and GSK stopped marketing the drug in 1999, leading the FDA to withdraw the drug’s approval. Before it was pulled, the drug was authorized — in 5 milligram and 25 milligram tablets — to treat the toxicities associated with a drug called methotrexate, among other uses.</p>
