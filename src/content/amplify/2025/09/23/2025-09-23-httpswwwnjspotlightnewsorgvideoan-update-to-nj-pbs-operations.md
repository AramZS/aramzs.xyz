title: An update to NJ PBS operations

<div><div>
<p>For the past 14 years, NJ PBS has been managed and operated by WNET, Channel 13 in New York. The station itself is licensed by the state of New Jersey.</p><p data-slot="gpt-square-0"></p>
<p>In a statement Tuesday, WNET announced, “Regrettably, we were not able to reach an agreement with the New Jersey Public Broadcasting Authority to continue beyond June 2026.”</p>
<p>Until that time, NJ PBS — and NJ Spotlight News with Briana Vannozzi — will remain on the air. After June 2026, NJ Spotlight News with Briana Vannozzi will continue to be produced and will air on THIRTEEN, its digital platforms and will be made available to other outlets interested in carrying it.</p>
<p>And while WNET will no longer operate the station after June 2026, it is eager to work with a NJ-based institution interested in shaping its future.</p><p data-slot="gpt-square-1"></p>
