<h2>Summary. </h2>
<p>Despite a surge in generative AI use across workplaces, most companies are seeing little measurable ROI. One possible reason is because AI tools are being used to produce “workslop”—content that appears polished but lacks real substance, offloading cognitive labor onto coworkers. Research from BetterUp Labs and Stanford found that 41% of workers have encountered such AI-generated output, costing nearly two hours of rework per instance and creating downstream productivity, trust, and collaboration issues. Leaders need to consider how they may be encouraging indiscriminate organizational mandates and offering too little guidance on quality standards. To counteract workslop, leaders should model purposeful AI use, establish clear norms, and encourage a “pilot mindset” that combines high agency with optimism—promoting AI as a collaborative tool, not a shortcut.</p>
<p>A confusing contradiction is unfolding in companies embracing generative AI tools: while workers are largely following mandates to embrace the technology, few are seeing it create real value. Consider, for instance, that the number of companies with fully AI-led processes <a href="https://www.accenture.com/content/dam/accenture/final/accenture-com/document-3/Accenture-Reinventing-Enterprise-Operations-FA-9-25-24.pdf">nearly doubled</a> last year, while AI use has likewise <a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/691643/work-nearly-doubled-two-years.aspx">doubled</a> at work since 2023. Yet a <a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai_report_2025.pdf">recent report</a> from the MIT Media Lab found that 95% of organizations see no measurable return on their investment in these technologies. So much activity, so much enthusiasm, so little return. Why?</p>
