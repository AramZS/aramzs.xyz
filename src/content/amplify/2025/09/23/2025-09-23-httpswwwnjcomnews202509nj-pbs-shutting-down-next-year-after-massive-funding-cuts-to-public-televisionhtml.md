title: NJ PBS shutting down next year after massive funding cuts to public television
---
<p>NJ PBS will be shutting down next year after WNET was unable to reach an agreement with the state’s Public Broadcasting Authority to continue operating the public television station, it was announced Tuesday.</p>
<p>Debra Falk, director of communications for NJ PBS, said the recent cuts by the <a href="https://www.nj.com/opinion/2025/06/trump-cuts-to-pbs-public-media-jeopardizes-njs-access-to-free-local-news-opinion.html">federal and state government</a> have been “very significant.”</p>
<p>New Jersey state legislators cut $750,000 in funding to NJ PBS during budget talks earlier this year, resulting in layoffs, according to <a href="https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/business/2025/08/14/nj-pbs-cut-staff-loss-federal-state-funding/85663437007/ ">NorthJersey.com</a>.</p>
<p>And across the country, public media outlets took a huge hit this summer when Congress decided to eliminate $1.1 billion allocated to the public broadcasting. That left some 330 PBS and 246 NPR stations, each with unique issues related to their communities and history, with the prospect of having to find other funding sources.</p>
<p>The WNET Group, the New York City-based public television station, entered into an agreement with authority to operate NJ PBS after then-Gov. Chris Christie <a href="https://www.nj.com/news/2010/05/njn_may_struggle_to_survive_af.html">cut funding to the state’s public television station</a> in 2010.</p>
<p>The current contract expires on June 30, 2026. Until then, the company will continue to operate NJ PBS and produce its nightly newscast, NJ Spotlight News with Briana Vannozzi, which will remain available on NJ PBS, Thirteen and digital platforms, according to a news release.</p>
<p>“WNET is committed to supporting the state through this transition and looks forward to collaborating with New Jersey–based institutions interested in operating a public television network,” said Falk. “We remain a willing partner to collaborate, and we will continue to serve the New Jersey community on Thirteen and our digital platforms.”</p>
<p>The shuttering of New Jersey PBS “is a loss for all of us who live here,” U.S. Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) said in a statement Tuesday. “Their programming benefits all New Jerseyans young and old. I’ll continue to stand up to the attacks on public broadcasting and support local networks in Jersey and across the country.”</p>
<p>State Sen. John Burzichelli (D-3rd Dist.) and state Sen. Andrew Zwicker (D-16th Dist.) on Tuesday called for a “top-to-bottom analysis” to find out what can be done to keep NJ PBS on the air.</p>
<p>“The shutdown of public TV in New Jersey will have real-life consequences, depriving the state’s residents of invaluable news and educational programming,” both said in a joint statement. “The television network has played a pivotal role in New Jersey, bridging the divide between New York and Philadelphia with trusted information relevant to the lives and civic activities of the state’s residents.”</p>
