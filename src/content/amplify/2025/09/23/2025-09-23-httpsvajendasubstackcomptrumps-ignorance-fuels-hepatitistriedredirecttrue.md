<p>There was an egregious display of ignorance by Trump at his “autism announcement” where he blamed acetaminophen as the cause of autism. He also went wild on a vaccine disinformation tangent with choice quotes like, “Don’t let them pump your baby up with the largest pile of stuff you’ve ever seen in your life,” and, “You have a little child. A little fragile child. And you’ve got a vat of 80 different vaccines, I guess, 80 different blends, and they pump it in.”</p>
<p>(Not only is this so wrong that it’s painful, but he is almost certainly this wrong about everything else, from the economy to defense. Pretty frightening.)</p>
<p>Arthur Caplan, a Professor of Medical Ethics at the New York University School of Medicine wrote this on Twitter about the fiasco, “The announcement on autism was the saddest display of ignorance, unfounded blather, dangerous advice, recycled nonsense and outright malpractice advice since Trump recommended bleach for Covid. A total laughingstock and embarrassment.”</p>

<p>The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) of OB/GYN immediately released <a href="https://www.acog.org/news/news-releases/2025/09/acog-affirms-safety-benefits-acetaminophen-pregnancy">this statement</a>, “Suggestions that acetaminophen use in pregnancy causes autism are not only highly concerning to clinicians but also irresponsible when considering the harmful and confusing message they send to pregnant patients, including those who may need to rely on this beneficial medicine during pregnancy.”</p>
<p>The whole response from ACOG is worth reading <a href="https://www.acog.org/news/news-releases/2025/09/acog-affirms-safety-benefits-acetaminophen-pregnancy#:~:text=%E2%80%9CSuggestions%20that%20acetaminophen%20use%20in,this%20beneficial%20medicine%20during%20pregnancy.">here</a>, and I agree with them that, “It is highly unsettling that our federal health agencies are willing to make an announcement that will affect the health and well-being of millions of people without the backing of reliable data.”</p>
<p>The highest-quality studies have shown no credible link between acetaminophen and autism. Fear and disinformation from Trump and RFK Jr about acetaminophen and autism means many (hundreds of thousands? perhaps millions?) of people may not take acetaminophen during pregnancy, one of the few safe medications for pain and fever in pregnancy. Many will unnecessarily suffer with pain and fevers, which themselves can have negative repercussions.</p>
<p>Falsely linking acetaminophen and autism is about blaming and punishing women and is yet another step towards policing women’s bodies. I would be remiss if I did not point out that I can find bad data that links epidurals with autism, because it’s possible to cherry-pick your way to almost any conclusion. Is it possible epidurals could be next on this list? Why not? Why would they stop with acetaminophen? After all, aren’t women supposed to feel pain during delivery as part of atonement for original sin?</p>
<p>I absolutely believe that RFK Jr and the Project 2025 goons will use shitty data to further blame women for a variety of pregnancy outcomes, as this is helpful in their goal of policing pregnancies. Fascists are obsessed with purity and cleansing, which has a natural overlap with the wellness movement, so the idea of medications spoiling the purity of pregnancy is right on brand with the fascists in power and their MAHA minions.</p>
<p>During the announcement, Trump also blathered on about the hepatitis B vaccine, spewing disinformation about not needing the vaccine at birth as, “Hepatitis B is sexually transmitted” and there is, “No reason” to give a baby a hepatitis B vaccine shortly after birth.</p>

<p>I am sure it shocks you to hear that Trump is ignorant about the importance of vaccinating against hepatitis B vaccination at birth. And what’s more, his disinformation could kill children.</p>
<p>Even though the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) decided not to address the current recommendation of universal vaccination against hepatitis B at birth, Trump’s incorrect ramblings are going to do damage.</p>
<p>I know writing about childhood vaccinations isn’t my usual beat, but combating disinformation is, and the more people who are informed, the more we can maybe immunize the pubic (#SorryNotSorry) against both the disinformation and hepatitis B. One of the most effective ways to change minds is through personal connections, so hopefully, some of you will have the opportunity to discuss the contents of this post with family and friends who might not have access to the facts. Also, if you are not vaccinated against hepatitis B, maybe this information will change your mind.</p>
<p>Trump and RFK Jr’s campaign against the hepatitis B vaccine might seem genuine on the surface. Why do we need to vaccinate at birth against a sexually transmitted infection (STI)? Why not wait until the teen or pre-teen years, like with the HPV vaccine? The second point that is often made is that as the recommendation is to universally screen for hepatitis B during pregnancy, babies who are at risk of acquiring hepatitis B during birth can be identified and vaccinated at birth, and then others can get vaccinated later.</p>
<p>While these may sound like scientific arguments, they are not. And that’s a big issue with disinformation, it can feel intuitive. The problem is that the folks repeating it are leaving out critical facts that disrupt their narrative. So let’s get you caught up on all the important stuff that Trump and RFK Jr are leaving out.</p>
<p>Hepatitis B is a virus that infects the liver. It can cause an acute infection, which can be silent or cause symptoms, and occasionally an acute infection can lead to liver failure, less so for children. While some people will clear hepatitis B after the initial infection, others will develop a chronic infection, where the virus is active, and this increases their risk of liver failure and liver cancer over their lifetime. Vaccinating infants against hepatitis B is very important because the younger someone is when they get infected, the greater their risk of developing chronic hepatitis B. When an adult gets hepatitis B, they have a 5% risk of a chronic infection.. Here are the stats for children:</p>
<ul><li><p>Infection during delivery: 90% risk of chronic infection</p></li><li><p>Infection after delivery but before age 2: 60% risk of chronic infection </p></li><li><p>Infection between age 2 and 9: 25% risk of chronic infection</p></li></ul>
<p>About 25% of people who get chronic hepatitis B will eventually die from the disease. So, yes, preventing childhood infection is very important.</p>
<p>While screening for hepatitis B during pregnancy and vaccinating infants born to someone with hepatitis B dramatically reduces the risk of getting the virus, not everyone gets prenatal care and human error can lead to someone not getting vaccinated. Vaccinating everyone at birth prevents any babies from falling through the cracks.</p>
<p>Before universal vaccination at birth, in the United States about 18,000 children under the age of 10 were infected with hepatitis B each year and 50% of those infections, about 9,000 cases, were acquired at birth. How did the other 9,000 kids a year get hepatitis B? From simply living their lives as kids in the United States.</p>
<p>Wait, what? How is this possible? How can kids get hepatitis B, a disease that is widely considered to be an STI, but no one knew how?</p>
<p>Hepatitis B is highly infectious. It is 100 times more transmissible than HIV and can be transmitted with minute amounts of blood not visible to the human eye. It can also be found in body fluids, like saliva. And, it can live on surfaces for up to 7 days. It can even be recovered from nail polish.</p>
<p>This means there are lots of ways that kids can get hepatitis B that have nothing to do with their mother having hepatitis B during pregnancy or sexual activity. I had my boys vaccinated when they were born prematurely. What if one of their health care professionals had chronic hepatitis B and didn’t know? In fact, many people who have the virus don’t know.</p>
<p>Here are some ways by which hepatitis B can be spread:</p>
<ul><li><p>Contact with blood from cuts in skin</p></li><li><p>Sharing gum</p></li><li><p>Sharing utensils, like spoons or forks</p></li><li><p>Sharing washcloths </p></li><li><p>Contact with blood during sports </p></li><li><p>A bite at a daycare</p></li><li><p>Improperly sterilized equipment at the doctor, dentist, acupuncturist office, or at the nail salon. </p></li></ul>
<p>What if your child uses the wrong toothbrush at home? What if they share nail polish at a sleep over and someone had a bleeding cuticle? And how do you sterilize the nail scissors at your home, because in one study, in homes where someone is positive for hepatitis B, the hepatitis B virus was detected on 27% of nail scissors and in 50% of nail clippings. Shared use of nail scissors in the house was associated with transmission of hepatitis B.</p>
<p><strong>Many seemingly innocuous activities can transmit hepatitis B. </strong>It’s really that infectious, and many people at risk of transmitting the virus don’t know they are infectious. This is why we recommend that all newborns be vaccinated against hepatitis B, because we want them protected from birth.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates the universal hepatitis B vaccination at birth is so effective at preventing hepatitis B in young children, and hence the ramifications, that one life is saved for every 13 vaccinated. It’s pretty difficult to get a better outcome for a health investment.</p>
<p>Since universal vaccination against hepatitis B at birth was adopted in the United States, cases in children have dropped by 99%. As preventing hepatitis B prevents liver cancer, the vaccine is one of our cancer moonshots!</p>
<p>Hepatitis B is a highly contagious viral infection that can lead to chronic liver disease and liver cancer, yet it is easily preventable with a safe and effective vaccine series that starts at birth. Despite decades of scientific evidence showing the vaccine’s lifesaving benefits, it has become a target for disinformation campaigns that spread fear and confusion. The result threatens public health, especially when amplified by public figures who ignore or distort the facts. Protecting people from hepatitis B requires not only access to vaccination but also confronting the dangerous spread of misinformation with clear, evidence-based communication.</p>
<p>When Trump, RFK Jr, and the MAHA movement rail against hepatitis B vaccination at birth understand this is not based on science. Rather, it is preying on fears and is based on willful ignorance tied up with some weird, perverted quest for purity. If we stop giving the HBV vaccine at birth, thousands of children will suffer unnecessarily and many will die, but I guess that is the necessary price of purity.</p>
