<p>A Guatemalan family from Leominster, Massachusetts, says federal agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement detained their 5-year-old daughter outside their home to pressure her father to surrender.</p>
<p><a data-id="https://www.telemundonuevainglaterra.com/noticias/local/ice-arresto-leominster/2524370/" data-type="link" href="https://www.telemundonuevainglaterra.com/noticias/local/ice-arresto-leominster/2524370/">In a recording obtained by Telemundo Nueva Inglaterra</a>, the family's anguished screams can be heard as they try to recover the girl.</p>
<p>"He was driving with my daughter when he called me and told me he thought someone was chasing him," the girl's mother said in Spanish.</p>
<p>In the video of the incident, which the family said occurred on Tuesday, the mother can be heard demanding her daughter's return.</p>
<p>"They took my daughter, she's 5 years old. She has autism spectrum," the woman says in the video. "Give me my daughter back."</p>
<p>The mother also explained that her daughter's father "managed to run back into the parking lot of my house, but they grabbed the girl."</p>
<p>The family said ICE agents challenged Edward Hip, a Guatemalan man who has lived in the United States for 22 years, to leave his home for his daughter.</p>
<p>"Is that your daughter? Come here so I can see those IDs," an agent can be heard saying in the video, which shows him motioning toward the camera.</p>
<p>"Hey, I can give it through the door," a man is heard saying in response.</p>
<p>"You can do it right here," the agent says, pointing to the ground in front of himself.</p>
<p>The mother reported alleged harassment by the officers.</p>
<p>"They threatened us, saying that if we didn't open the door within 15 minutes, they would enter the house," she told Telemundo Nueva Inglaterra.</p>
<p>Leominster police arrived at the scene, recovered the child and returned her to the family.</p>
<p>However, two days later, on Hip's wife's birthday, federal agents returned to the house, pulled the man out of the car and arrested him.</p>
<p>"Officers came out behind my house, arrested him, took him away," the mother said. "We are not criminals."</p>
<p>Lizeth Román, a friend and neighbor of the family, demands that further investigation be conducted into the agents' actions.</p>
<p>"The use of bounty hunters and officers without a warrant be investigated," she told Telemundo Nueva Inglaterra. "They had them cornered. We don't know if they're still there right now. They came out from behind the house, got in through there, and tried to get into our window."</p>
<p>The girl is in good condition, the family says, while her father is being held at an ICE detention center in Plymouth. He and his wife have an active asylum claim and are the parents of two children born in the United States.</p>
<p>Telemundo Nueva Inglaterra reached out to ICE for comment, but has not yet received a response.</p>
