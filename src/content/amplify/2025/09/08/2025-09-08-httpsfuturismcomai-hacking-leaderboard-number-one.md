<p>For the first time ever, an AI model has seized the top spot on a white hat hacking leaderboard.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://xbow.com/blog/top-1-how-xbow-did-it/">blog post</a>, the cybersecurity firm Xbow boasted about its historic rise to the top of the <a href="https://hackerone.com/leaderboard">HackerOne leaderboard</a>, which ranks the top ethical hackers in the US against each other as they duke it out in the name of cybersecurity.</p>
<p>Xbow's use of AI for white hat hacking follows a <a href="https://www.itpro.com/security/the-history-and-future-of-automation-in-security">long tradition of automation</a> on both sides of the ethics divide, culminating in a <a href="https://tech-adv.com/blog/ai-cyber-attack-statistics/">majority of hackers using the technology</a>. Xbow claims its AI is "fully autonomous," operating with minimal human input, though of course that's a common claim that often turns out to be <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/google-duplex-phone-calls-human">more complicated in reality</a>.</p>
<p>Xbow's AI is centered on what's known as "automated penetration testing," a method that simulates cyberattacks by exploiting vulnerabilities in a given system — a much faster version of the so-called "pentests" that human white hat hackers do on behalf of clients to probe their potential vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>As company founder Oege de Moor <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-24/one-of-the-best-hackers-in-the-country-is-an-ai-bot?sref=YfHlo0rL">told <em>Bloomberg</em></a>, such "manual" — read: human-conducted — tests cost about $18,000 on average and can take weeks to complete, often leading businesses to put off this <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-penetration-testing/">important security measure</a> until it's too late.</p>
<p>"By automating this," de Moor said, "we can completely change the equation."</p>
<p>While it's clear that Xbow's process works, it's not without flaws. As <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/software/ai/an-ai-holds-the-top-slot-in-a-leaderboard-that-ranks-people-who-hunt-for-system-vulnerabilities-used-by-hackers/"><em>PC Gamer</em> notes</a>, Xbow's tech is as <a href="https://futurism.com/ai-industry-problem-smarter-hallucinating">prone to hallucination</a> as any other AI — but the company circumvents any harm, it says, by having humans vet each issue as it arises.</p>
<p>Beyond winning the top hacker spot, the year-old startup has also <a href="https://xbow.com/blog/series-b/">raised $117 million in seed funding</a> to date from financiers including Sequoia Capital and the venture capital firm NFDG. Speaking to <em>Bloomberg</em>, NFDG partner Nat Friedman said that although Xbow's AI is "exciting," he also finds it "somewhat terrifying."</p>
<p>"We are now in the era of machines hacking machines," Friedman said.</p>
