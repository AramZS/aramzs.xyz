  Michael R. Bernstein doesn’t need everyone to love his “weird music” - The
  Washington Post
---
<p>You might not even remember you’re listening to it. All good.</p>
<p>Some people learn to code in Python and call themselves software engineers. Michael R. Bernstein is not one of those people.</p>
<p>The D.C.-based musician uses Python to code the kind of dreamlike music you almost forget you’re listening to while it’s playing. It does not impose but rather aches until it seeps into the wrinkles of your brain. His most recent recording, “The Perfect Radio Station of the Mind,” is a 30-minute instrumental track that weaves jubilance and eeriness into pulsating background noise.</p>
<p>While Bernstein, 45, now describes himself as an “old guy that makes weird music,” he spent his young adulthood sleuthing around a teeming DIY scene in New York City. In the early 2000s, he was a member of the industrial noise band Double Leopards and the thorny psychedelic group Religious Knives. When he moved to D.C. in 2014, Bernstein says he found a “musical home” at Rhizome – a space where “the freaks” could pursue the avant-garde, experimental jazz, improvisation and more.</p>
<p>Since then, no two shows of Bernstein’s have been the same. At his upcoming Rhizome performance, he plans to set up handmade “robots” that emit light and repetitive notes while he plays tracks from his computer and paces around the room. That is, he says, “if this all works out.”</p>
<p>In terms of his gear and his sound, Bernstein’s inspiration doesn’t come from the current artificial intelligence discourse or some sci-fi film but from Harry Partch, the 20th-century composer who engineered complex bespoke instruments that used an array of materials including eucalyptus branches, beer bottles and Pyrex carboys from a radiation lab. Bernstein first encountered Partch’s work at an exhibition in the West Village when he was an undergraduate at NYU, and he’s been entranced ever since. If Partch was hardware, Bernstein is software.</p>
<p>If you decide to stream “The Perfect Radio Station of the Mind” on Bandcamp, it might not be your first online encounter with Bernstein’s musical world – you’ve probably seen the heavily memed 2023 image of then-Vice President <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/music/2024/07/23/kamala-harris-record-collection-jd-vance-spotify/">Kamala Harris brandishing a jazz </a>record. In the photo, she is standing outside of Home Rule Records, a shop in D.C.’s Brightwood Park neighborhood that Bernstein has co-owned for the past decade.</p>
<p>The visit sparked a rush of attention for the store, but Bernstein was unfazed. In terms of his music, he thinks of his audience in similar terms. “In a 20-to-30 minute performance, it really only takes one moment to really communicate with someone in a deep and resonant way,” Bernstein says. “If I play to a room of 50 people, it’s okay if 48 of them don’t get it, if one or two people can really understand it deeply or have a good experience.”</p>
