<p>Google's CEO, Sundar Pichai, said in May that <a href="https://www.seroundtable.com/google-sundar-pichai-web-publishing-ai-39491.html">web publishing is not dying</a>. Nick Fox, VP of Search at Google, said in May that the <a href="https://www.seroundtable.com/google-on-ai-ctr-studies-39628.html">web is thriving</a>. But in a court document filed by Google on late Friday, Google's lawyers wrote, "The fact is that today, the open web is already in rapid decline."</p>
<p>This document can be found <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.vaed.533508/gov.uscourts.vaed.533508.1664.0.pdf">over here (PDF)</a> and on the top of page five, it says:</p>
<blockquote>The fact is that today, the open web is already in rapid decline and Plaintiffs’ divestiture proposal would only accelerate that decline, harming publishers who currently rely on open-web display advertising revenue.</blockquote>
<p>Here is a screenshot:</p>

<p>I spotted this via Jason Kint who posted about it on <a href="https://x.com/jason_kint/status/1964379070084325719">X</a> about this:</p>

<p>This statement seems to contradict what Google's top executives said just months ago and agrees with what the open web community has been saying for several months now.</p>
<p>Of course, some may read into this statement differently.</p>

<blockquote><p>Glad this is being covered as it would suggest either Google executives have been lying to the public and investors for months or to a Court. It’s important context, Barry, to note this is in their actual arguments why they shouldn’t have to divest their adjudicated monopolies. <a href="https://t.co/JZVsKiosPa">https://t.co/JZVsKiosPa</a></p>— Jason Kint (@jason_kint) <a href="https://twitter.com/jason_kint/status/1965017740160418028?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 8, 2025</a></blockquote>
