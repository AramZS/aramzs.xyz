<p>The term “plant” is often used to describe someone whose success was not solely the result of a grassroots movement, but instead bolstered by powerful corporate interests who secretly poured massive amounts of money into ensuring their fame.</p>
<p>For example: Charlie Kirk was a fossil fuel industry plant. The right-wing activist murdered last week built his massive platform for <a href="https://x.com/charliekirk11/status/1938631309930496221">racism</a>, <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/charlie-kirk/charlie-kirk-tells-taylor-swift-submit-your-husband-and-have-ton-children">sexism</a>, <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/charlie-kirk/charlie-kirk-uses-slur-refer-transgender-tiktok-influencer">transphobia</a> and <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/charlie-kirk/charlie-kirk-likens-concern-about-climate-change-pseudo-paganism">climate denial</a> in part by using anonymous funding from Big Oil.</p>
<p>Turning Point USA, the group Kirk founded to ignite a culture war on college campuses, has managed to hide much of its funding sources. Roughly half of the group’s <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/800835023">$40 million in income</a> in 2020 came from 10 anonymous donors, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/internet/turning-point-usa-donations-surged-pandemic-rcna37143">NBC News reported</a>.</p>
<p>But in 2017, Kirk admitted that some of the group’s anonymous donors “are in the fossil fuel space.” Speaking to <em><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/a-conservative-nonprofit-that-seeks-to-transform-college-campuses-faces-allegations-of-racial-bias-and-illegal-campaign-activity">The New Yorker</a></em><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/a-conservative-nonprofit-that-seeks-to-transform-college-campuses-faces-allegations-of-racial-bias-and-illegal-campaign-activity">’s Jane Mayer</a>, Kirk disclosed that he’d fundraised for TPUSA at the annual meeting of the Independent Petroleum Association of America (IPAA), as well as the 2017 board meeting of the National Mining Association.</p>
<p>In those meetings, Kirk promised oil and gas companies he’d fight “the myth that fossil fuels are dirty,” and target the “leftist professors” on college campuses who “perpetuated” the “myth.”</p>
<p>The meetings “went great,” Kirk told Mayer. The IPAA’s president, Barry Russell, wound up <a href="https://archive.is/pQj6D">joining TPUSA’s advisory council</a>, where he remains today. (Kirk had said that most advisory council members are also TPUSA donors).</p>
<h3>How Kirk tried to re-popularize climate denial</h3>
<p>Over the next nine years, Kirk worked to chip away at <a href="https://climatecommunication.yale.edu/publications/younger-americans-are-growing-more-worried-about-global-warming/">young Americans’ rising concerns about climate change</a>. He did this by claiming climate science is still debated—and then peddling the conspiracy theory that all climate policies are a Democratic bid for government control.</p>
<p>“A tyrant’s fantasy is to have a massive green economy transition,” <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/media/4009494">he said in 2023</a>. “You can get rid of private property, you can control people’s movements. It’s fundamentally the abolition of civilization as we know it.”</p>
<p>To justify his claim that climate science is unsettled, Kirk would often cite “experts” who downplay the seriousness of planetary heating. For example, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/reel/809191097507305">in 2023</a>, Kirk claimed climate science is “debated” because “a Nobel prize winning scientist recently came out and said there is no real climate crisis.” Kirk also <a href="https://x.com/charliekirk11/status/886665137322512384?lang=en">cited the opinions of John Coleman</a>, the now-deceased founder of the Weather Channel, as evidence that climate change is a hoax.</p>
<p>But the experts Kirk cited were almost always unqualified. For example, Coleman was a meteorologist, not a climate scientist, and his claims were <a href="https://science.feedback.org/review/there-are-clear-evidence-for-climate-change-contrary-to-claims-by-john-coleman/">frequently</a> <a href="https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-john-coleman-climate-change-176441300111">debunked</a> by publishing climate scientists. The Nobel-Prize-winning scientist Kirk referenced, John Clauser, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/11/16/john-clauser-nobel-climate-denial/">is not a climate scientist</a>, and won the Nobel for physics in the 1970s. No other Nobel Prize-winning physicist denies mainstream climate science; in fact, <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/news/2021/10/05/princetons-syukuro-manabe-receives-nobel-prize-physics">some of them are climate scientists</a> themselves.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, Kirk never considered the opinions of publishing climate scientists to be credible. Instead, he reflexively dismissed their warnings as "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tm0jIRDzHeY">garbage … designed for one thing: power and control.</a>”</p>

<h3>Kirk’s final climate segment</h3>
<p>Kirk’s continued to frame climate change as a conspiracy in an interview with <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/charlie-kirk/charlie-kirk-science-says-nothing-scientists-say-things-global-warming-does-not-have">Trump’s Secretary of Energy Chris Wright</a> three weeks before his death.</p>
<p>In the interview, Kirk and Wright spoke about the Department of Energy’s recently-released <a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/department-energy-issues-report-evaluating-impact-greenhouse-gasses-us-climate-invites">151-page report</a> claiming climate change is not a serious problem. That report was put together by five contrarian scientists <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/how-chris-wright-recruited-a-team-to-upend-climate-science-2/">personally recruited by Wright</a>, a former fracking executive.</p>
<p>Kirk praised the report, and dismissed all criticism against it as politically motivated. “We think this is all politicized,” Kirk said. “This is driven towards a environmentalist agenda that is trying to weaken American energy dominance.”</p>
<p>Wright agreed, and said all the critics of his climate report only took issue with who wrote it—not the data within it. “They want to impugn the writers or impugn the way we reference people,” Wright said. “They want to find little things. What we want to talk about is the data.”</p>
<p>This, however, was objectively false. The data within Wright’s report was <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/energy-department-greenhouse-gas-report-climate-experts/">meticulously criticized</a> by 85 publishing climate scientists, who issued <a href="https://sites.google.com/tamu.edu/doeresponse/home">a 439-page rebuttal</a> pointing out various misrepresentations, messy citations, cherry-picking, and factual errors. In addition, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/scientists-say-new-government-climate-report-twists-their-work/">many of the scientists cited in Wright’s report</a> complained that their data was misrepresented, and explained their complaints in detail.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most mind-boggling part of Kirk’s final climate interview, however, was the argument he used to claim there can be no such thing as a scientific consensus about climate change.</p>
<p>”Science does not have consensus,” he said. “This is a very important thing. Right? Science says nothing. Scientists say things. Okay? Science never talks. Science is silent. This is a good thing that could apply to everything.”</p>
<p>Kirk was certainly correct that scientists say things. But over the course of his life, Kirk was set on ignoring most of them. For example, the vast majority of publishing climate scientists have been saying the same thing over and over for decades: That heat-trapping pollution from fossil fuels, industrial agriculture, and deforestation is steadily raising the average temperature of the planet—and that the warming poses an existential threat to human, animal and plant life.</p>
<p>Kirk ignored those scientists for a simple reason: Because listening to them would mean accepting that fossil fuels harm people. Neither Kirk nor his donors could accept that reality.</p>
<h3>The inseparable connection between climate denial and right-wing extremism</h3>
<p>The point of this newsletter is not to claim that Kirk was paid by the fossil fuel industry to say things he didn’t believe about climate change. I think most online political commentators genuinely believe what they’re saying, no matter who they’re funded by.</p>
<p>The point is to reinforce <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/may/01/big-oil-danger-disinformation-fossil-fuels">what has been true for decades</a>: <strong>the fossil fuel industry is behind most of the climate disinformation you see and hear today.</strong></p>
<p>Big Oil has spent billions sowing doubt about the reality and severity of climate change. They’ve done this for one reason: Solving climate change would require using less of their product, and using less of their product would hurt their bottom line.</p>
<p>Pretty much everyone with a massive following who spreads climate denial derives money or power from fossil fuels. The sooner everyone understands that, the better.</p>
<p>The other point here is to remind everyone about the inseparable connection between climate denial and other types of right-wing extremism. Often, you’ll hear climate activists debate whether it’s a good idea to get involved in larger movements for justice, or whether it’s better to just “stay in their lane” of climate policy.</p>
<p>The opposition to climate action is not having that debate. Instead, they are funding right-wing extremists who say things like the Civil Rights Act was "<a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2025/09/viral-claims-about-charlie-kirks-words/">huge mistake</a>;” that Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson was "<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/charlie-kirks-rhetoric-inspired-supporters-enraged-foes-2025-09-13/">a diversity hire</a>;" that <a href="https://www.advocate.com/politics/2022/4/14/conservative-pundit-charlie-kirk-says-trans-people-are-blame-inflation">trans people are responsible for inflation</a>; and that Taylor Swift should "<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/09/13/charlie-kirk-turning-point-politics-debates/">submit to [her] husband</a>." As long as “climate change is fake” is part of that rhetoric, they don’t care what the rest of it looks like.</p>
<p>Racism, sexism, and transphobia is being used to build the climate denier base. If you want climate action, you can’t pick and choose which you fight back against.</p>
