<p>Officials will also tout the drug leucovorin as a potential autism treatment, in what President Donald Trump has billed as a “very important” announcement.</p>
<p>The Trump administration is expected to unveil new efforts on Monday exploring how <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/09/05/rfk-autism-tylenol-pregnancy/">one medication may be linked to autism</a> and another one can treat it, according to four people with knowledge of the plans who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the announcement was not yet public.</p>
