<p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation is reportedly preparing to categorize transgender people as “violent extremists,” a categorization supported by organizations affiliated with Project 2025.</p>
<p>According to a <a data-event-boundary="click" data-event-click='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-in-view='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-include-experiments="true" data-offer-url="https://www.kenklippenstein.com/p/fbi-readies-new-war-on-trans-people?publication_id=7677&amp;utm_campaign=email-post-title&amp;r=dwhc5&amp;utm_medium=email" href="https://www.kenklippenstein.com/p/fbi-readies-new-war-on-trans-people?publication_id=7677&amp;utm_campaign=email-post-title&amp;r=dwhc5&amp;utm_medium=email">September 18 report</a> by independent journalist Ken Klippenstein, two anonymous national security officials said that the Bureau is discussing treating trans subjects as a subset of its new threat category, “Nihilistic Violent Extremists” (NVEs), which was created earlier this year. The Bureau defines “Nihilistic Violent Extremism” as “criminal conduct… in furtherance of political, social, or religious goals that derive primarily from a hatred of society at large and a desire to bring about its collapse by sowing indiscriminate chaos.”</p>
<p>Officials said that such a classification would give the Trump administration “political (and media) cover” as they escalate their <a href="https://www.them.us/story/trump-administration-every-anti-lgbtq-attack-second-hundred-days">anti-trans campaign</a> in the aftermath of right-wing pundit <a href="https://www.them.us/story/charlie-kirk-trans-shooter-lgbtq-weapon">Charlie Kirk’s death</a>.</p>
<p>“They are cynically targeting trans people because the shooter’s lover was trans,” an unnamed senior intelligence official told Klippenstein. “The administration has convinced itself that the Charlie Kirk murder exposes some dark conspiracy.”</p>
<p>Last week, the false claim that there were “transgender” engravings on the bullets that suspect Tyler Robinson allegedly used to shoot Kirk began <a data-event-boundary="click" data-event-click='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-in-view='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-include-experiments="true" data-offer-url="https://www.primetimer.com/news/steven-crowder-claims-gun-recovered-at-charlie-kirks-shooting-had-bullet-cartridges-engraved-with-transgender-and-anti-fascist-ideology" href="https://www.primetimer.com/news/steven-crowder-claims-gun-recovered-at-charlie-kirks-shooting-had-bullet-cartridges-engraved-with-transgender-and-anti-fascist-ideology">circulating widely</a>, boosted by anti-LGBTQ+ conservatives like <a href="https://www.them.us/story/nancy-mace-trans-people-institutionalized-internet-charlie-kirk">Rep. Nancy Mace</a> and Steven Crowder. Utah Gov. Spencer Cox <a data-event-boundary="click" data-event-click='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-in-view='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-include-experiments="true" data-offer-url="https://thehill.com/homenews/lgbtq/5501615-human-rights-campaign-wsj-retraction-kirk/" href="https://thehill.com/homenews/lgbtq/5501615-human-rights-campaign-wsj-retraction-kirk/">later confirmed</a> that there was “no indication that the ammunition included transgender references.” On Sunday, Cox told <em>Meet the Press</em> that Robinson was allegedly in a romantic relationship with a roommate who is trans, providing no additional public corroborating data or information of the roommate's gender. The authorities have stipulated the roommate has been cooperating with the investigation and was not aware of the shooting prior to its occurrence.</p>
<p>Despite no evidence linking an alleged trans roommate to Robinson’s motivation for shooting Kirk, right-wingers are nevertheless attempting to use this detail to push an anti-trans agenda. <a data-event-boundary="click" data-event-click='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-in-view='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-include-experiments="true" data-offer-url="https://x.com/itsyourgov/status/1968802472111083949?s=12" href="https://x.com/itsyourgov/status/1968802472111083949?s=12">In a petition</a> launched on Thursday, the <a href="https://www.them.us/story/heritage-foundation-republican-party-reagan-trump-project-2025">Heritage Foundation</a> — the far-right think tank behind the derided and controversial <a href="https://www.them.us/story/project-2025-explained">Project 2025</a> — and its spin-off group, the Oversight Project, asked the FBI to designate “Transgender Ideology-Inspired Violent Extremism” (TIVE) as a domestic terrorism threat category.</p>
<p>The group defines “TIVE” as “the belief that violence is justified against people who oppose [the trans community],” as well as the belief that opposing trans rights “itself constitutes a form of violence towards people who identify as [trans or gender nonconforming]... or poses an imminent threat to such persons’ emotional, psychological, or physical safety, including through self-harm or suicide.”</p>
<p>As <a data-event-boundary="click" data-event-click='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-in-view='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-include-experiments="true" data-offer-url="https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/us-politics/charlie-kirk-shooting-transgender-extremism-terrorism-b2829621.html" href="https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/us-politics/charlie-kirk-shooting-transgender-extremism-terrorism-b2829621.html"><em>The Independent</em></a> noted, if such a category is adopted by the FBI, it could be applied to rhetoric used by activists, writers, and allies speaking out against anti-trans policies and rhetoric.</p>
<p>At least a dozen <a href="https://www.them.us/story/nancy-mace-trans-people-institutionalized-internet-charlie-kirk">hoaxes have claimed trans people were responsible for mass shootings</a> and other incidents since 2012.In reality, there is no evidence suggesting significant patterns of violence committed by trans people. In 2024, The Gun Violence Archive’s Executive Director, Mark Bryant, said that out of 5,000 mass shootings tracked by the archive, the number of trans or LGBTQ+ suspects is in “the single digit numbers.”</p>
