<h2>A court ruling keeps the search giant intact while also allowing payments to the iPhone maker to continue at a vulnerable time</h2>

<p>Google and Apple are both breathing easier. For Apple, a deep sigh may be particularly appropriate.</p>
<p>The two tech giants scored a notable victory late Tuesday from a <a href="https://archive.is/o/BnYRO/https://www.wsj.com/tech/judge-bars-google-from-exclusive-search-deals-orders-data-sharing-e65a2191">federal judge’s ruling</a> in one of the U.S. government’s two antitrust cases against Google. U.S. District Judge Amit P. Mehta essentially turned down the government’s request to break up Google or force the company to end the payments it makes to Apple.</p>
<p>Those payments have kept Google as the default search engine on Apple’s devices while providing a valuable revenue stream to Apple. It is one that now reportedly reaches more than $20 billion a year.</p>
<p>The government argued that <a href="https://archive.is/o/BnYRO/https://www.wsj.com/tech/google-loses-federal-antitrust-case-27810c43">those payments lessened competition</a>, since few others in the search-engine business can afford to match the price Google pays. But Judge Mehta countered that banning the payments would actually strengthen Google’s hand by essentially giving the company free access to Apple’s huge base of users.</p>
<p>“So, for now, Google will be permitted to pay distributors for default placement,” Mehta wrote. “There are strong reasons not to jolt the system and to allow market forces to do the work.”</p>
<p>Google’s payments of $20 billion amount to only about 5% of Apple’s total annual revenue now. But they’re a <a href="https://archive.is/o/BnYRO/https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/stock-market-today-dow-sp500-nasdaq-live-12-24-2024/card/heard-on-the-street-apple-is-not-losing-google-s-billions-without-a-fight-DzKJB5QeBIDCywMHBgi8">much larger contributor</a> to the bottom line, given that Apple incurs little incremental costs associated with that revenue stream.</p>
<p>Apple’s services segment, which includes the licensing payments from Google, commanded gross profits of 75 cents for every dollar of revenue for the 12-month period ended in June. Gross margins on Apple’s hardware business were 37% for the same period.</p>
<p>Losing such a profitable revenue stream would have come at a <a href="https://archive.is/o/BnYRO/https://www.wsj.com/tech/apple-aaple-stock-analysis-ac141e7e">difficult time for Apple</a>. The iPhone still accounts for more than half the company’s annual revenue yet has averaged just 2% annual revenue growth over the past three years.</p>
<p>Apple’s slow start in generative artificial intelligence also means expectations are rather low for this year’s crop of new phones—expected to be <a href="https://archive.is/o/BnYRO/https://www.wsj.com/tech/personal-tech/iphone-17-upgrade-decision-cb29aed7">unveiled next week</a>. Analysts are projecting that iPhone revenue will grow less than 4% in Apple’s fiscal year that ends next September.</p>
<p>Ironically, the existence of Perplexity and other purveyors of AI-forward browsers as upstart competitors to Google helped stave off punishment on the payment-ban question. In declining to institute such a ban, the judge reasoned that the <a href="https://archive.is/o/BnYRO/https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/ais-threat-to-google-just-got-real-8280b4ee">competitive landscape was already threatening</a> Google’s dominant position—meaning the court didn’t need to intervene.</p>
<p>Google isn’t out of the legal woods. There are <a href="https://archive.is/o/BnYRO/https://www.wsj.com/business/media/judge-rules-google-operates-illegal-ad-monopoly-1d955ed4">cases pending in the U.S.</a> and Europe, as well as the lingering possibility that a body appointed by Judge Mehta to oversee the court’s remedies finds Google isn’t sticking to its obligations.</p>
<p>Apple, too, may not be home free. Mehta said he is prepared to revisit the idea of a payment ban “if competition is not substantially restored through the remedies the court does impose.”</p>
<p>But make no mistake, the ruling amounts to a major win for both companies.</p>
<p>Google’s parent <a href="https://archive.is/o/BnYRO/https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/googles-unloved-stock-makes-it-a-big-tech-bargain-189f2533">has been undervalued by investors</a> as it slogs through the legal challenges. Meanwhile, Apple has faced the prospect of losing a large chunk of its operating profits at a time when tech giants are having to pour many billions into AI investments.</p>
<p>For both companies, maintaining the status quo is about as good as it gets.</p>
