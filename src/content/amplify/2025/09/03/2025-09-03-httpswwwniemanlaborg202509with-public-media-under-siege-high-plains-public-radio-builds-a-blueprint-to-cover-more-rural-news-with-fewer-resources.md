<p>To expand regional coverage while keeping costs down, HPPR aims to build out a “contributors network” of part-time and volunteer community members coordinated by a lean central editorial team.</p>
<p>On June 13, <a href="https://www.hppr.org">High Plains Public Radio</a> received some welcome news: It had been awarded a $750,000 <a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2025/07/press-forward-grants-22-7-million-to-22-newsroom-projects/">grant</a> from Press Forward.</p>
<p>Over the next three years, the station will build out a regional news contributors network called the High Plains Civic Media Network for the rural communities it serves across the Oklahoma and Texas panhandles, eastern Colorado, western Kansas, and far southwest Nebraska.</p>
<p>The news of the grant came just one day after the House of Representatives <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/06/12/us/house-rescissions-vote.html">voted to slash</a> funding for public media by $1.1 billion. The Senate <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/07/18/nx-s1-5469912/npr-congress-rescission-funding-trump">approved</a> the rescission package that President Trump signed into law in July.</p>
<p>The Corporation for Public Broadcasting <a href="https://cpb.org/sites/default/files/FY%202025%20Radio%20CSG%20General%20Provisions%20and%20Eligibility%20Criteria.pdf">defines</a> “Rural Audience Service Stations” as stations with a coverage area population (CAP) density “equal to or less than 40 people per square kilometer.” That works out to about 104 people per square mile.</p>
<p>HPPR’s coverage area, spanning nearly 90 counties and 332 communities, has a CAP density of about nine people per square mile, said Quentin Hope, executive director and <a href="https://archive.storycorps.org/interviews/valarie-smith-and-quentin-hope/">founder</a>, including 248 communities with populations under 1,000. “It’s a wide area, rural both by demography, but also in terms of mindset and identity,” he said. (The 1930s Dust Bowl, he added, “was exactly centered in HPPR’s coverage area.” This is a region where large-scale agriculture underpins the economy, but “a very promising wheat crop can be destroyed in minutes by a passing hailstorm.”)</p>

<p>The rescission hits rural stations like HPPR <a href="https://niemanreports.org/rural-stations-federal-cuts-npr-cpb-kaxe/">especially hard</a> because they <a href="https://cpb.org/aboutpb/rural">rely heavily</a> on funding from the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/08/01/nx-s1-5489808/cpb-shut-down-public-broadcasting-trump">Corporation for Public Broadcasting</a> (CPB). For High Plains, the loss of expected operating grants combined with the loss of supplementary funding the CPB has long contributed toward critical shared services (like music rights and the <a href="https://www.nprdistribution.org/about">satellite system</a>) amount to “about $550,000 in lost money over two years, which is around 15% of the budget,” Hope said. Not only is that a large gap to fill — it’s the loss of “backbone support” from one of the most reliable sources of largely unrestricted operating funding for the station. The CPB had provided funding to HPPR for 45 years of broadcast operation, Hope said.</p>

<p>In a moment when many public media stations are thinking about <a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2025/08/how-tribal-radio-stations-are-preparing-for-a-future-without-the-corporation-for-public-broadcasting/">plugging budget holes</a> and <a href="https://niemanreports.org/local-trusted-defunded-public-media-federal-funding-npr-cpb/">staying afloat</a>, I wanted to talk to Hope about how High Plains is working to build something new even as it reckons with financial pressure. As he wrote in a <a href="https://www.hppr.org/2025-07-17/moving-forward-amid-the-loss-of-federal-funding-with-your-support">public statement</a> to HPPR listeners, “rather than a ‘struggle to survive’ I see this work as a time to ‘realize the potential’ of HPPR,” embracing the imperative for public media to innovate that some have <a href="https://dicktofel.substack.com/p/what-to-do-now-about-public-broadcasting">explicitly encouraged</a>.</p>
<p>The Press Forward grant was the culmination of years of “strategic thinking” for High Plains Public Radio, Hope said. “It’s the direction we need to go anyway, just to serve more and to serve better.” The threat-turned-reality of losing CPB funding, he added, was “all the more reason to do it.”</p>
<p>“Open calls for funding don’t happen in a bubble,” said Press Forward director <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dale-anglin-6915213/">Dale Anglin</a>. The team selecting projects to fund took the challenges newsrooms face into account, including threatened public media cuts. She highlighted the “collaborative” nature of the proposed public media project.</p>
<p>“Especially now, we need strong regional infrastructure that can connect smaller stations to larger entities and help them continue to provide essential local news and information to their communities,” Anglin said.</p>
<p>High Plains Public Radio currently has <a href="https://www.hppr.org/people">10 full-time employees</a>. Just one of those is a full-time reporter, covering western Kansas, and his editorial direction comes from the editor of the <a href="https://www.kmuw.org/about-kansas-news-service">Kansas News Service</a>. Four other staffers are involved in “editorial” more broadly — interviews, features, newsletters, and so on. HPPR has studios in Garden City, Kansas, and in Amarillo, Texas, and some staff work remotely from other locations. (Hope lives in Denver, but grew up in Garden City, where his mother worked for the Garden City Telegram.)</p>
<p>In terms of content, HPPR offers two programming services. <a href="https://www.hppr.org/high-plains-public-radio-schedule#weekly">HPPR Mix</a> is broadcast over HPPR’s <a href="https://www.hppr.org/hppr-fm-stations-and-coverage">18-station network</a>, and is also available through digital streaming. The service airs news and public affairs (about 40% of the weekly schedule); classical music (a little over 20%), Americana, folk, and jazz music (about 30%), and culture programs. That includes 26 hours of locally produced and hosted programming, and around an hour daily of regional and state news content including newscasts and four-minute short story segments.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.hppr.org/hppr-connect-radio-schedule#weekly-schedule">HPPR Connect</a>, meanwhile, is available via the HPPR mobile app and digital streaming on its website. This service provides national and international news, information, discussion, and arts and culture programming from NPR, Public Radio International, and other public radio producers, Hope said.</p>
<p>HPPR also produces 10 to 12 pieces per week for its website. About a quarter of these are “news,” Hope said; others are more related to arts and culture or area events and programs.</p>
<p>In other words, local news is just a small part of HPPR’s digital and broadcast offerings. The numbers underscore “the limitations of traditional, broadcast-based approaches to providing ‘local’ news,” Hope said, “especially for a public radio operation like HPPR that serves a wide region.” Because HPPR covers such a wide area, its engineering costs are high: Excluding labor, engineering accounts for about 46% of the budget, including powering the network of 18 transmitters, insurance, and maintenance.</p>
<p>He envisions the Civic Media Network as a model for HPPR to produce much more local news and better serve its audience across platforms, while remaining financially sustainable. If successful, he hopes news outlets in other rural areas can apply the same model to do more with less and better serve (and grow) their audiences.</p>
<p>This model essentially entails building out a region-wide “contributors network” coordinated by a lean central editorial team. HPPR plans to hire three new positions to this central team (a network editor, network director, and network digital producer) alongside its existing staff.</p>
<p>The contributors network, meanwhile, will consist of a mix of part-time and volunteer positions (and some in between who might receive modest monthly stipends with an “output expectation”), including, Hope expects, some retirees. The network positions will include:</p>
<ul> <li>“community correspondents” who cover some general-interest news;</li> <li>“topical correspondents” who are more like beat reporters (for the High Plains, Hope said, “probably the number one topic is water resources and the Ogallala Aquifer, on which so much of the economy depends”);</li> <li>volunteer “community connectors” who monitor local social media and act as HPPR ambassadors and points of contact in local communities;</li> <li>and “regional curators” who summarize and curate some stories.</li> </ul>
<p>Overall, Hope estimated that these various positions will amount to a network of 80 to 100 people. That would include just two full-time “regional reporters”: HPPR’s current lone reporter covering western Kansas, and a second reporter to cover the Texas Panhandle.<sup><a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2025/09/with-public-media-under-siege-high-plains-public-radio-builds-a-blueprint-to-cover-more-rural-news-with-fewer-resources/#footnote_0_242860">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Hope contrasted his vision for this network with Report for America’s model. While the latter matches trained reporters with communities (sometimes locals, sometimes not), he plans for the network to consist of people who may lack journalism training but who are already rooted in their communities, and can be trained through partnerships HPPR aims to develop with local universities and individual journalism professors.</p>
<p>“It’s bringing the <em>journalism</em> to the community, rather than the journalists to the community,” he said.</p>
<figure><a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2022/07/city-bureau-gets-10-million-to-make-public-meetings-more-public/?relatedstory"><img alt="" sizes="auto, (max-width: 315px) 100vw, 315px" src="https://www.niemanlab.org/images/city-bureau-documenters-315x177.jpg" srcset="https://www.niemanlab.org/images/city-bureau-documenters-315x177.jpg 315w, https://www.niemanlab.org/images/city-bureau-documenters-220x124.jpg 220w"/></a></figure>
<p>HPPR is not trying to reinvent the wheel entirely. “Lots of pieces of this have been [and are] being done in various places,” Hope said, pointing to the <a href="https://www.documenters.org">Documenters</a> <a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2022/07/city-bureau-gets-10-million-to-make-public-meetings-more-public/">network</a> as rooted in similar ideas. “There’s a lot of learning in the system and experiments and working models that we hope to draw on, and adapt appropriately.”</p>
<p>Making news sustainable is an especially tall order for rural areas in large part because economies of scale don’t apply. The network should give HPPR a presence in most communities without requiring it to pay full-time reporters in every community. (That presence, in turn, should strengthen HPPR’s pitch to county-specific foundations and trusts; HPPR will seek additional local grant funding for community correspondents.)</p>
<p>Hope believes producing more content will help HPPR grow its audience significantly. Ten to 12 pieces per week on the website, he said, is “not enough information flow to really build an audience.” With the network, he wants to grow that output “sevenfold,” to about 15 to 20 pieces per day, which would include some curated content, some original reporting, and some very short pieces.</p>
<p>“If you don’t have enough stuff coming people’s way, they don’t have a reason to come back or to bookmark you,” he said. Audiences need “a sufficient flow to keep checking in, to form habits.”</p>
<figure><a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2025/08/these-public-radio-stations-have-built-online-audiences-thatll-help-them-survive-federal-cuts/?relatedstory"><img alt="" sizes="auto, (max-width: 315px) 100vw, 315px" src="https://www.niemanlab.org/images/chanhee-lee-ZjqsbZvKsTs-unsplash-315x177.jpg" srcset="https://www.niemanlab.org/images/chanhee-lee-ZjqsbZvKsTs-unsplash-315x177.jpg 315w, https://www.niemanlab.org/images/chanhee-lee-ZjqsbZvKsTs-unsplash-220x124.jpg 220w"/></a></figure>
<p>HPPR’s best estimate of its weekly cumulative broadcast audience, Hope said, is about 26,000 unique listeners, plus about 2,500 on digital streams. It gets about 28,000 unique monthly website visitors. (See <a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2025/08/these-public-radio-stations-have-built-online-audiences-thatll-help-them-survive-federal-cuts/">these examples</a> of public radio stations with standout online audiences, mostly in major metro areas.)</p>
<p>“We hope to at least triple this reach by the time the HPCMN is built out,” he said. (Press Forward <a href="https://www.pressforward.news/infrastructure25/">described</a> HPPR’s civic media network as a service “for more than 600,000 adults across the High Plains region.”)</p>
<p>Expanding and better serving HPPR’s audience also requires a multi-platform emphasis, Hope added, and treating broadcast as one platform among many instead of the primary vector for news. He envisions both the network and central editorial team producing content for multiple platforms, “with an emphasis on digital platforms.”</p>
<p>Since founding HPPR <a href="https://www.hppr.org/hppr-history">in 1977</a>, Hope has positioned the organization as both “an ear to the world, and a voice of the High Plains,” he said.</p>
<p>Being an NPR affiliate, and carrying the BBC and other music programming, Hope sees HPPR as having “always done well as an ear to the world,” which he said is important in a rural area that can feel isolated. But, he added, “I think we’ve always felt like the voice of the High Plains, we’d never really realized.”</p>
<p>A network tailored to meet local information needs and interests, he hopes, will help HPPR better realize that voice.</p>
<p>The $750,000 from Press Forward doesn’t help HPPR with its CPB budget shortfall. This month, HPPR <a href="https://www.hppr.org/2025-09-01/its-up-to-us">launched</a> an “Up to Us” bridge funding <a href="https://www.hppr.org/its-up-to-us">campaign</a> to raise the two years of lost CPB funding over the next four months on top of its annual end-of-year fundraising (about $215,000 in membership, and $67,000 in sponsorship). HPPR, Hope noted, is in a “highly conservative area,” and doesn’t have the luxury of the short-term “rage giving” many more urban stations (with smaller budget shortfalls) have successfully tapped.</p>
<p>“We’re having to be a little more careful in planning out over the next several months, and from multiple sources,” he said. (The campaign is still primarily geared toward individual donors, but HPPR is also looking for business sponsorship and foundation support, he said.)</p>
<p>Still, “the announcement of the grant was fortuitous, because we could tell a future-oriented story,” Hope said.</p>
<p>“It’s a story that says, ‘this is bridging and building to something that fulfills the mission, but in a far more significant way than you imagined before,’” he said. “It’s the next generation of public media, or civic media for the region. That’s a more powerful story and more compelling one — it’s also a more hopeful story, particularly for staff or for the board, that it’s not a struggle to survive, it’s an opportunity…to fulfill the mission you had in mind from the very start.”</p>
<ol><li>The second reporting position is not covered by the Press Forward grant, Hope noted; “we’ll need to find other funding” that would cover about $62,000 a year between salary, payroll taxes, and health insurance. He projects HPPR will turn to this in the project’s second year, once the network is up and running, and thinks the position could ultimately be funded jointly with another news organization in the area.
