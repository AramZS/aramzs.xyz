<p>Author and essayist Malcolm Gladwell has claimed he was previously “cowed” into accepting transgender women in women’s sports, declaring on a podcast this week that trans women “have no place” competing against their cisgender peers.</p>
<p>Gladwell, a longtime <em>New Yorker</em> contributor best known for his 2000 book <em>The Tipping Point</em>, made the comments on an episode of the podcast “The Real Science of Sport” released Tuesday. The podcast’s hosts, scientist Ross Tucker and sports journalist Mike Finch, have <a data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://podcasts.apple.com/za/podcast/s3-e8-why-transgender-athletes-threaten-fairness-in/id1461719225?i=1000522515770"}' data-offer-url="https://podcasts.apple.com/za/podcast/s3-e8-why-transgender-athletes-threaten-fairness-in/id1461719225?i=1000522515770" href="https://podcasts.apple.com/za/podcast/s3-e8-why-transgender-athletes-threaten-fairness-in/id1461719225?i=1000522515770">denounced trans-inclusive sports</a> on past episodes of the show, and Tucker himself was <a data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/26/sports/olympics/world-rugby-transgender-women.html"}' data-offer-url="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/26/sports/olympics/world-rugby-transgender-women.html" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/26/sports/olympics/world-rugby-transgender-women.html">involved in World Rugby’s decision</a> to <a href="https://www.them.us/story/world-rugby-trans-athlete-guidelines">ban trans women from competition</a> several years ago.</p>
<p>Tucker was also a guest at a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Hm6pejAP4">2022 MIT athletic panel</a>, hosted by Gladwell, regarding trans women’s participation in athletic competitions. Speaking to Tucker on the podcast this week, Gladwell said that he regretted not endorsing Tucker’s position during the panel, claiming — without evidence — that “90%” of the audience was “on [Tucker’s] side” but had been unwilling to admit it. (Gladwell had <a data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://x.com/Gladwell/status/1123969807383236609"}' data-offer-url="https://x.com/Gladwell/status/1123969807383236609" href="https://x.com/Gladwell/status/1123969807383236609">already endorsed Tucker’s views</a> on trans athletes as “smart” in 2019.)</p>
<p>“If we did a replay of that exact panel at the Sloan conference this coming March [...] it would be, I suspect, near unanimity in the room that trans athletes have no place in the female category. I don’t think there’s any question,” Gladwell said, adding that he was “ashamed” and had felt too “cowed” to express his opinion on the subject. (A vast majority of U.S. residents <a href="https://www.them.us/story/73-percent-of-americans-oppose-laws-banning-trans-girls-from-womens-sports">supported trans-inclusive sports</a> just four years ago, but polling has <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/02/26/americans-have-grown-more-supportive-of-restrictions-for-trans-people-in-recent-years/">recently shifted</a> afterseveral years of <a href="https://www.them.us/story/trump-republican-campaign-anti-trans-ads-election">Republican anti-trans propaganda</a>.)</p>
<p>Gladwell went on to allege that during the 2022 panel, sports researcher <a href="https://www.them.us/story/womens-sports-policy-working-group-anti-trans-athletes-martina-navratilova">Joanna Harper</a> told Tucker that “you [cis people] have to let us win” — which Gladwell took as evidence that trans people were demanding to win competitions, and that “no one [...] question the considerable physical physiological advantage they bring to the sport.”</p>
<p>In fact, Harper was responding to Gladwell’s final question, in which he asked whether trans athletes’ successes in elite sports would “undercut” trans people hoping to compete at non-elite levels. “If we let trans women compete in women's sport, then we have to let them win. Not win disproportionately, but win at least some of the time,” Harper responded — saying, in other words, that trans women should not be required to perform poorly in sports to compete.</p>
<p>Sharing the episode on <a href="https://www.them.us/story/elon-musk-twitter-transphobic-harassment-deadnaming-misgendering">Elon Musk’s X</a> platform, <a data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://x.com/Gladwell/status/1963233983765831682"}' data-offer-url="https://x.com/Gladwell/status/1963233983765831682" href="https://x.com/Gladwell/status/1963233983765831682">Gladwell wrote</a> that he had gone on his “favorite podcast” to discuss his “favorite topic.”</p>
<p>The fixation on trans athletes is a part of a larger anti-trans strategy from conservatives. Last week, former swimmer <a href="https://www.them.us/story/riley-gaines-sports-trans-rights">Riley Gaines told the <em>New York Times</em></a> that winning on sports was key. “The gender ideology movement is a house of cards,” she claimed, with athletic participation “the card that makes all of it crumble,” opening the door to convince the general public that trans women are not truly women. That refrain is one often repeated by the Trump administration, which has prevented trans athletes from <a href="https://www.them.us/story/trump-administration-immigration-visa-restrictions-trans-women-sports">obtaining travel visas</a> and used inclusive sports policies to <a href="https://www.them.us/story/title-ix-special-investigations-team-trump-administration-linda-mcmahon-trans-athletes">target some states’ federal funding</a>.</p>
<p>Once celebrated for his <a data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2019/8/23/20828597/the-10000-hour-rule-debunked"}' data-offer-url="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2019/8/23/20828597/the-10000-hour-rule-debunked" href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2019/8/23/20828597/the-10000-hour-rule-debunked">since-debunked “10,000 hour rule”</a> of skill mastery, the 63-year-old Gladwell has become a more controversial figure over time. In early 2020, Gladwell opined that Penn State should <a data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.centredaily.com/news/local/community/state-college/article239761683.html"}' data-offer-url="https://www.centredaily.com/news/local/community/state-college/article239761683.html" href="https://www.centredaily.com/news/local/community/state-college/article239761683.html">restore a statue of Joe Paterno</a>, the football coach who was dismissed for concealing sexual abuse allegations made against former defensive coordinator Jerry Sandusky. Later that same year, Gladwell joined more than 150 other writers — including <a href="https://www.them.us/story/jk-rowling-chris-columbus-anti-trans-views-response">J.K. Rowling</a> and <a href="https://www.them.us/story/white-gay-men-are-hindering-our-progress">Andrew Sullivan</a> — in signing a widely derided <a data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/07/harpers-letter-free-speech/614080/"}' data-offer-url="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/07/harpers-letter-free-speech/614080/" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/07/harpers-letter-free-speech/614080/">open letter in <em>Harper’s</em> magazine</a> to decry “illiberalism” and “intolerance of opposing views” (i.e., so-called “cancel culture”). That December, Gladwell also <a data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.thedailybeast.com/malcolm-gladwell-puzzled-by-new-yorkers-firing-of-jeff-toobin-for-zoom-masturbation/"}' data-offer-url="https://www.thedailybeast.com/malcolm-gladwell-puzzled-by-new-yorkers-firing-of-jeff-toobin-for-zoom-masturbation/" href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/malcolm-gladwell-puzzled-by-new-yorkers-firing-of-jeff-toobin-for-zoom-masturbation/">declared</a> that he “couldn’t find any intellectual justification” for <em>The New Yorker</em>’s firing of Jeffrey Toobin, who was found to have <a data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/jeffrey-toobin-masturbation-disaster_n_64534da4e4b04616030ff32f"}' data-offer-url="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/jeffrey-toobin-masturbation-disaster_n_64534da4e4b04616030ff32f" href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/jeffrey-toobin-masturbation-disaster_n_64534da4e4b04616030ff32f">masturbated on a Zoom video call</a> between co-workers and staff at the radio station WNYC.</p>
