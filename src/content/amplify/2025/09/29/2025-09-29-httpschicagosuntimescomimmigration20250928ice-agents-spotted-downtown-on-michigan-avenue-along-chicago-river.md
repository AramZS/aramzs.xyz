<p>Dozens of federal immigration agents were spotted making arrests in downtown Chicago and the River North neighborhood early Sunday afternoon.</p>
<p>A Sun-Times photographer saw the agents, many of whom appeared to be with U.S. Border Patrol, make at least two arrests.</p>
<p>The agents were walking north on Michigan Avenue from Millennium Park toward Tribune Tower. The agents, some of whom were masked, then walked down Wacker Drive near Trump Tower, while some headed to the Riverwalk. They then made their way to River North.</p>
<p>Some passersby shouted at the agents telling them to go home and “ICE sucks.” One person shouted, “Thank you!” Another said: “Real patriotic guys. Real patriotic.”</p>
<p>As the officers walked north on Clark Avenue, about two dozen protesters tailed them, chanting, “ICE go home!”</p>
<p>Their presence downtown is the latest part of President Donald Trump’s administration campaign against immigration. The administration announced the launch of “Operation Midway Blitz” on Sept. 8, bringing a flood of federal immigration officers to the Chicago area to conduct raids and arrests.</p>
<p>Since then, several people have been arrested. In response, protesters have regularly gathered at the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in suburban Broadview, where there was little activity on Sunday. In contrast, federal officers again fired rubber pellets and chemical irritants into crowds of protesters gathered there Friday and Saturday.</p>
<p>One arrest witnessed by the Sun-Times on Sunday happened near Clark and Superior streets around 2 p.m. Agents chased down a man and asked him for his papers. About two dozen agents surrounded the man, who was handcuffed. Several activists were also present recording the arrest.</p>

<p>Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights confirmed federal agents were seen downtown. The organization said over 50 agents were seen around 1 p.m. near Millennium Park, the Michigan Avenue Apple Store and other locations along Michigan Avenue.</p>
<p>Agents were still in the area Sunday afternoon in an “ongoing operation,” according to the organization.</p>
<p>Earlier Sunday, the Department of Homeland Security <a data-cms-ai="0" href="https://x.com/DHSgov/status/1972297960319832252">said in a social media post</a> that 11 people had been arrested during a protest outside the Broadview ICE facility Saturday night.</p>
<p><a data-cms-ai="0" href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/news/2025/09/27/ice-broadview-action-mayor-katrina-thompson-immigration">Federal agents launched tear gas</a> and other chemical irritants near protesters gathered at the facility. A Chicago journalist was among the people arrested.</p>
<p>DHS claimed in a social media post that two guns were recovered from the people arrested. The agency also alleged an “explosive device” was found near the facility. The post did not say whether the people arrested had been charged and what they were charged with.</p>
