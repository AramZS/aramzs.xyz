<p><a href="https://pitchfork.com/artists/1742-godspeed-you-black-emperor/">Godspeed You! Black Emperor</a> are the latest indie-rockers to pull their music from Spotify. However, the Canadian post-rock band have gone one step further and removed nearly their entire discography from all major streaming services. Pitchfork has reached out to the band’s label, <a href="https://pitchfork.com/thepitch/10-essential-albums-from-constellation-records-the-legendary-independent-record-label/">Constellation Records</a>, for comment.</p>
<p>Currently, no Godspeed You! Black Emperor records are available to stream on <a data-event-boundary="click" data-event-click='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-in-view='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-include-experiments="true" data-offer-url="https://open.spotify.com/artist/4svpOyfmQKuWpHLjgy4cdK?si=oGyktZF2SWytOXgGtRRm4A" href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/4svpOyfmQKuWpHLjgy4cdK?si=oGyktZF2SWytOXgGtRRm4A">Spotify</a> or <a data-event-boundary="click" data-event-click='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-in-view='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-include-experiments="true" data-offer-url="https://tidal.com/browse/artist/3641735" href="https://tidal.com/browse/artist/3641735">Tidal</a>. The band’s two albums for <a data-event-boundary="click" data-event-click='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-in-view='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-include-experiments="true" data-offer-url="https://kranky.net/" href="https://kranky.net/">Kranky</a>—1998’s <a href="https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/godspeed-you-black-emperor-f-a-infinity/"><em>F# A# ∞</em></a> and 2000’s <a href="https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3489-lift-your-skinny-fists-like-antennas-to-heaven/"><em>Lift Your Skinny Fists like Antennas to Heaven</em></a>—are still up on <a data-event-boundary="click" data-event-click='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-in-view='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-include-experiments="true" data-offer-url="https://music.apple.com/us/artist/godspeed-you-black-emperor/40884339" href="https://music.apple.com/us/artist/godspeed-you-black-emperor/40884339">Apple Music</a>, but a representative for the label confirmed to Pitchfork that they are in the process of being taken down. “Kranky has always granted artists control over how their music is presented and disseminated,” they shared in a statement. Godspeed You! Black Emperor’s catalog can still be purchased and streamed via <a data-event-boundary="click" data-event-click='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-in-view='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-include-experiments="true" data-offer-url="https://godspeedyoublackemperor.bandcamp.com/" href="https://godspeedyoublackemperor.bandcamp.com/">Bandcamp</a>.</p>
