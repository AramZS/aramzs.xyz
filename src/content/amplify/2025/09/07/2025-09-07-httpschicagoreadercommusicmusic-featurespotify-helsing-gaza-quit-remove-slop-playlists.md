<p>Six hundred and seventy-five million people in 184 countries and territories—roughly 8.2 percent of the world’s population—actively use Spotify every month, according to the Swedish streaming company’s <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1639920/000163992025000003/ck0001639920-20241231.htm">most recent filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission</a>. “Spotify has transformed the way people access and enjoy music, podcasts, and audiobooks,” the 2024 SEC paperwork says. The platform has also had a profound impact—almost none of it good—on the people who create those media.</p>
<p>Even if you’re nestled so comfortably in the embrace of the Spotify algorithm that you barely notice which artists’ songs it’s playing, you probably know that streaming royalty rates are, generally speaking, garbage. Spotify is a vast engine for extracting wealth from the music ecosystem, and one of the main ways it does this is by paying, on average, just $0.003 for every time a song is streamed. <a href="https://artists.spotify.com/en/blog/modernizing-our-royalty-system">Last year, Spotify further tilted its playing field toward big stars by instituting a policy withholding</a> payouts entirely on songs streamed fewer than 1,000 times in a 12-month period. (Full disclosure: In 2021, I was paid to appear on the Spotify-produced podcast <em>Bandsplain</em>.) These paltry rates are a big part of why some musicians have never played ball with Spotify—and why others who once streamed their music through the platform are now leaving it.</p>
<p>Spotify devalues music in other ways too—for instance, by encouraging listeners to treat it as wallpaper, or by building playlists rife with agreeably bland commissioned tracks it can license at even more favorable rates. (Look up <a href="https://harpers.org/archive/2025/01/the-ghosts-in-the-machine-liz-pelly-spotify-musicians/">Liz Pelly’s reporting on “Perfect Fit Content.”</a>) But because Spotify offers a jaw-droppingly vast catalog—more than 100 million songs, per that same SEC filing—it also has the biggest user base. This keeps artists on the platform despite the growing litany of injustices and insults it inflicts on them. In 2020, for example, <a href="https://musically.com/2020/07/30/spotify-ceo-talks-covid-19-artist-incomes-and-podcasting-interview/">Spotify cofounder and CEO Daniel Ek</a> said that musicians need to release more material to create “a continuous engagement with their fans” if they want to thrive on the platform: “You can’t record music once every three to four years and think that’s going to be enough.” Ek himself has no music on Spotify, and he hasn’t had to cultivate continuous engagement with a single fan to be <a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/daniel-ek/">worth, according to <em>Forbes</em>, roughly $10 billion</a>.</p>
<p>It’d be an understatement to say Ek’s business plan and approach to art are sore spots for people in the music industry. “We’ve just felt like it’s been a necessary evil for a long time,” says Ben Moskow, cofounder of Chicago hip-hop multimedia collective <a href="https://chicagoreader.com/best-of-chicago/best-music-nightlife/real-ones-tyrel-tchinchinian-zack-fox/">Real Ones</a>. “But I just don’t think it has to be, and I’m glad that we just finally have agreed to start treating it that way.”</p>
<p>I’ve noticed lots of musicians openly questioning their engagement with Spotify this year, especially since the January publication of Pelly’s rigorously reported book, <em>Mood Machine: The Rise of Spotify and the Costs of the Perfect Playlist</em>. And this summer, the exodus accelerated when a damning piece of news came to light. <a href="https://helsing.ai/newsroom/helsing-raises-eur600m-to-invest-in-european-technological-sovereignty">On June 17, German AI defense company Helsing announced</a> it had raised 600 million euros in a funding round led by Prima Materia, Ek’s venture capital firm. Ek also serves as chairman of Helsing.</p>
<p>This connection isn’t new—Prima Materia invested 100 million euros in Helsing in 2021, and this was one of the reasons <a href="https://chicagoreader.com/music/concert-preview/cindy-lee-empty-bottle/">cited by</a> front person Patrick Flegel of Canadian indie project Cindy Lee for refusing to upload the 2024 album <em>Diamond Jubilee</em> to Spotify. (They initially self-released it as a folder of WAV files via a GeoCities site.) But the latest news has traveled further and seems to be sticking better. Since mid-June, several high-profile indie acts—<a href="https://pitchfork.com/news/deerhoof-to-remove-music-from-spotify/">Deerhoof</a>, <a href="https://pitchfork.com/news/xiu-xiu-to-pull-music-from-spotify/">Xiu Xiu</a>, <a href="https://pitchfork.com/news/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-leave-spotify/">King Gizzard &amp; the Lizard Wizard</a>—have pulled their music from Spotify and explicitly cited Ek’s involvement in Helsing.</p>

<p><sup>Smushie’s new second album, <em>Cicero Pizza Anthology</em>, is no longer on Spotify. </sup></p>
<p>Some Chicago artists are following suit. On July 25, the same day King Gizzard left Spotify, Chicago singer-songwriter Austin Koenigstein, who records psychedelic pop as <a href="https://chicagoreader.com/music/smushie-psych-pop/">Smushie</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DMjFUX2RTC7/?img_index=1">announced he’d be bailing on the platform too</a>. Two weeks before that, he’d self-released his second Smushie album, <em>Cicero Pizza Anthology</em>. “I had the best two weeks of online performance on Spotify after my record came out,” Koenigstein says. “Things were really spiking, and it felt promising. But I was all the while being exposed to stuff about AI bands—like the proliferation of that stuff on the platform.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jul/14/an-ai-generated-band-got-1m-plays-on-spotify-now-music-insiders-say-listeners-should-be-warned">In July</a>, an AI-generated soft-rock band called Velvet Sundown attracted press attention after racking up more than a million streams on a couple albums it had uploaded to Spotify in June. This is a separate phenomenon from Spotify’s Perfect Fit Content program—those “ghost artists” are real musicians, but they typically work pseudonymously and sign deals with Spotify that give up certain royalty rights. This allows Spotify to place ghost tracks on playlists with huge followings and keep a bigger share of the money they generate.</p>
<p>Ek is funneling money he’s made from Spotify—money that could’ve gone to struggling musicians, if he’d been content to be less obscenely wealthy—into an AI weapons company. This has weighed heavily on many artists, Koenigstein among them. “The weapons industry has one face to it,” he says. “It’s pro-war, wherever it is—or pro-militarism, or violence. I started to feel like it was all zero-sum.” The news of Ek’s new investment in Helsing broke as Israel intensified its genocidal campaign against Palestinians in Gaza with a near total blockade of food and other aid, and that was the last straw for Koenigstein. He decided to pull his solo work from Spotify. “I saw this video of a girl eating sand in Gaza,” he says, “and I was like, ‘I would do anything if I could just wash a little bit of this off of me.’”</p>

<p>Chicago metal band <a href="https://chicagoreader.com/music/immortal-bird-reggies/">Immortal Bird</a> pulled its early DIY material from Spotify the same day Koenigstein removed Smushie. For the band to remove the rest of their music, they’ll have to reach agreements with the folks who released it—most notably Pittsburgh label 20 Buck Spin, which put out their 2019 album, <em>Thrive on Neglect</em>, and its 2024 follow-up, <em>Sin Querencia</em>.</p>
<p>“It was really easy,” says vocalist <a href="https://chicagoreader.com/music/rae-amitay-of-immortal-bird-on-the-resuscitation-of-a-tlc-classic/">Rae Amitay</a>. “It’s not like we’re leaving money on the table—it’s really not a huge move for us,” they explain. “At a couple points in our career, we’ve made it onto those big Spotify playlists with half a million listeners, and that boosts your plays and it looks cool for a couple weeks. When our 2019 album came out—that was probably the most successful one, and Spotify was behind that in whatever way they were—we had, like, 20, 30K monthly listeners, something like that. It goes away. It’s not real. There’s no real return on that success.”</p>
<p>Amitay supports Palestinian liberation and bailed on Spotify in large part because of Helsing. “Everyone has their lines and their limits,” they say. “I just don’t like 40-year-old <em>Megamind</em> supervillains investing in AI weaponry.”</p>
<p>Ben Moskow from Real Ones and <a href="https://chicagoreader.com/music/minor-moon-lincoln-hall/">Minor Moon</a> main man Sam Cantor are both making plans to leave Spotify. Moskow isn’t a musician, but the Real Ones collective has such an active role in the scene that its movement on Spotify could change a lot of minds. The collective has used its Spotify account to build playlists on which its members collaborate.</p>
<p>“Our biggest playlist, the Coldest in Chicago playlist on Spotify, has 300-something likes, and that was after a few years of development,” Moskow says. “But we were still, like, ‘Oh, it would be a shame to have to start over and not care about all that growth.’ Eventually, when we really looked at it on paper, there’s no equivalency here to be made. It was just, like, ‘We can’t keep doing this.’” Real Ones stopped paying for a premium Spotify account and imported all its playlists to Tidal. Moskow says the collective will have to talk further about whether to completely pull the plug on Spotify.</p>
<p>Sam Cantor has long been skeptical of Spotify—in 2021, he attended Zoom meetings held by the <a href="https://chicagoreader.com/music/music-workers-jobs-disappeared-but-their-bills-didnt/">local chapter of the Union of Musicians and Allied Workers</a> in advance of a demonstration in front of Spotify’s Chicago offices. Despite his discomfort, though, Minor Moon’s alt-Americana is on the platform. “Over the last ten or so years, if you’re not on Spotify, as an indie band, it’s in some ways felt like you are excluding yourself from the opportunity to be heard by the wider public,” he says. “You’re foreclosing the opportunity to sort of be ‘discovered’—and that ‘democratized discoverability,’ it didn’t feel completely imaginary. I think in the last few years, it’s felt more like they’re dangling something shiny in front of all of us. It’s really not a widely accessible way to be discovered, more and more, in the context of all the slop that’s increasingly a big part of these playlists.”</p>
<p>Cantor has the same complaints about Spotify as everyone else I spoke to—especially Ek’s Helsing investment, in light of the genocide in Gaza. Like most musicians, Cantor doesn’t see significant income from Spotify—he makes more money selling LPs and other physical merch—but leaving isn’t without its risks. Some venues, for instance, use Spotify metrics to help them decide who to book.</p>
<figure><p class="rw-outer-content"><span>Some content could not be imported from the original document.</span> <a href="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=88571657/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=333333/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/">View content ↗ </a></p></figure>
<p><sup>Minor Moon’s 2024 album <em>The Light Up Waltz</em> is still on Spotify—but not for long.</sup></p>
<p>“You’re not just disappearing to the listeners that you have or might potentially have,” Cantor says. “You’re also disappearing to the portion of the industry that’s placing Spotify metrics as a central part of how they determine the reach and potential of a given artist. I’m really interested in being part of a cultural shift in which that is no longer the case.”</p>
<p>Whether that cultural shift occurs now or years from now is up to the artists whose millions of tracks make up Spotify’s library. “Part of me feels like we’ve all been talking about this for so long—we’re like, ‘We’re gonna get off,’” Koenigstein says. “We all need to see each other do it, and we’ve been playing chicken for a long time. King Gizzard, they’re a huge band, which is nice. But I think people also need to start seeing maybe their friends’ band go for it.”</p>
