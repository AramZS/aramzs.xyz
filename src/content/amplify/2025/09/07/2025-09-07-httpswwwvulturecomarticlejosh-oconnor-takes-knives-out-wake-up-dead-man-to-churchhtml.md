<p>Like any good mystery series, the Benoit Blanc movies know the value of repetition. You could call it a formula if you felt like knocking this series of films from writer-director <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/11/rian-johnson-knives-out.html">Rian Johnson</a>, which kicked off with <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/11/knives-out-movie-review-rian-johnsons-whodunit.html"><em>Knives Out</em></a> in 2019 and continued with <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2022/12/glass-onion-a-knives-out-mystery-movie-review.html"><em>Glass Onion</em></a> in 2022. As those two films did, Johnson’s latest, <em>Wake Up Dead Man</em>, premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival to this year’s most rabid crowds so far. Once again, Johnson has gathered together an all-star cast — this group includes Glenn Close, Andrew Scott, Kerry Washington, Jeremy Renner, and Josh Brolin — to set up the pins so that Daniel Craig’s dapper Southern detective can knock ’em all down. But while <em>Wake Up Dead Man</em> is another murder mystery, the most compelling crime in the film occurs in plain sight, as <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/challengers-josh-oconnor-is-filthy.html">Josh O’Connor</a> outright steals the film out from under Benoit Blanc, and he does it dressed in the vestments of a Catholic priest.</p>
<p>O’Connor plays Reverend Jud Duplenticy, a young priest seeking his own salvation. He gets sent to a small upstate New York church to assist Monsignor Wicks (Josh Brolin), a kind of Catholic Colonel Kurtz — aggressive and territorial and half-mad. O’Connor plays his half of the power struggle between the two priests initially as light comedy; the English actor (playing American again, as he did in <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/the-actual-tennis-in-challengers-is-kind-of-a-serve.html"><em>Challengers</em></a>) is downright nebbishy in moments. He’s a great fit for Johnson’s tendency to puncture the moment with comic relief, which is kind of infuriating. No one that handsome should also get to have good comic timing.</p>
<p>But it’s in the film’s surprising degree of sincerity that O’Connor makes himself invaluable. <em>Wake Up Dead Man</em> is the most earnest (and least comedic) of the three Blanc films. And it’s sincere about faith, of all things, and politics, too. My guess is that will occupy a great deal of the reaction to this movie. If <em>Knives Out</em> and <em>Glass Onion</em> were sideswipes at the anti-immigrant right and Silicon Valley fascists, respectively, <em>Wake Up Dead Man</em> is Rian Johnson taking dead aim at Trump and his band of hard-liners. The all-star cast mostly plays Wicks’ parishioners, each with their own little set of personal foibles that at any moment could become a motive to kill. Because yes, there is eventually a murder, and Blanc turns up in town full of theories and brio.</p>
<p>But this is Father Jud’s movie. We get a third of the way into it before Blanc arrives, and by then, O’Connor has already more than capably put the film on his shoulders. An idealistic priest with a profound belief in the Church’s power to save souls could be a tough sell for another actor, but O’Connor capably lands every beat — he’s awfully formidable for a pretty boy, and awfully sympathetic for a priest. There’s a darkness on the periphery of his performance, too. No man of such intense religious faith can ever be ruled out as a killer, after all.</p>
<p>Daniel Craig was deservedly lauded for the first two Blanc films, and he’s no less winning in this one. But with <em>Wake Up Dead Man</em> as interested in salvation as it is in its whodunit yarn, Josh O’Connor ends up as the film’s MVP: Most Valuable… Priest.
