<p>With the warm California sunshine on their backs, the Russian dissidents were finally at journey’s end. A year after fleeing their homeland, they had crossed the border into America from Mexico to start a new life in the free world.</p>
<p>Vadim and his wife, Yuliya, believed they were safe at last, far beyond the reach of President Putin’s repressive regime. Today, however, they are being forced to reassess their choice.</p>
<p>In recent months, dozens of Russians have been expelled from the US and returned to Russia with the co-operation of immigration authorities.</p>
<figure></figure><p>Vadim and Yuliya, a couple in their mid-thirties, whose names have been changed to protect their identities, live in fear of a knock at their Brooklyn door — not from the FSB, but from US Immigration Customs and Enforcement (ICE) agents. “Everyday could be my last here,” said Vadim, who is nervous about taking the subway for fear of bumping into ICE officers.</p>
<p>On August 27, less than a fortnight after President Trump’s summit with Putin in Alaska, dozens of Russians were rounded up and deported. Among them was Artyom Vovchenko, 27, a deserter from the war in Ukraine. He is facing a prison sentence of up to decade or could be sent back to the front line.</p>
<p>“Part of me hoped that Putin would be arrested when he came to Alaska because he’s a war criminal,” said Vadim. “And yet Trump welcomed him as if he were a friend.”</p>
<p>Vadim and Yuliya’s supposed crime in Russia was documenting the reality of the conflict on an anti-war Telegram channel. They shared stories with tens of thousands of followers that contradict the propaganda peddled on Russian state TV.</p>

<p>The couple were forced to flee Yakutia, their native province, in 2023 after discovering they were under surveillance by the Russian security services. Yuliya was fired from her job for refusing to donate to the army and Vadim went into hiding to avoid being drafted into the war.</p>
<p>Their options were limited because Europe is mostly closed to Russian citizens. Countries like Thailand that were initially welcoming to Russian émigrés have become less attractive after the government in Bangkok signed an extradition treaty with Putin.</p>
<p>Like many others, Vadim and Yuliya concluded the only truly safe country was the proudest democracy of them all: the United States of America. An estimated 70,000 Russians have crossed the American southern border after the invasion of Ukraine.</p>
<p>In the winter of 2023, Vadim and Yuliya flew to Mexico City via Moscow and Istanbul with the aim of reaching US soil. “We were terrified we would be taken off the flight in Moscow,” Vadim said.</p>
<figure><picture><figure><img alt="Illustration of a handwritten letter with a drawing of a couple releasing a dove carrying a message." src="https://www.thetimes.com/imageserver/image/%2Fcbd793e7-5994-4f21-a8e9-d6a6e2e4a9a6.jpg?crop=959%2C1280%2C0%2C0"/><figcaption>A letter sent from Yuliya and Vadim in California: “To our dear friend, wishing you a merry Christmas and a happy new year. We just wanted to say that we’re truly grateful to you and everyone who has helped us this whole time. At what has been a really difficult time for us, your daily help and support has been invaluable! Also, we must thank you for organising the mission to save our favourite cats! We must hope that next year the bloody war will end and the usurper will die or be sent to prison for the rest of his life!”</figcaption></figure></picture></figure>
<p>Pretending to be tourists, the couple arrived in Mexico to suspicious questions by the authorities and spent months trying to get an appointment on the US border to claim asylum. They finally crossed in July last year. Upon arrival, they were sent to a detention facility in California. They were imprisoned for five months.</p>
<p>According to Vadim, around a quarter of the asylum seekers in the California detention centre were from ex-Soviet countries. Among them, they recognised an acquaintance who worked for Alexei Navalny’s anti-corruption organisation. The migrants were detained in cells holding 64 people each. A number of them attempted suicide, including one man who tried to tear open his veins with his teeth after he was placed in solitary confinement, according to Vadim. “I’d escaped Russian prison only to end up in an American jail,” he said.</p>
<p>The Russians were eventually released on parole on condition they wore an ankle tag. They now live in fear that they could be arrested by an ICE agent at any moment and sent back to Moscow.</p>
<p>In the popular imagination, <a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/8a59c2ab-4e65-430d-8e59-ff656d8f16c1">Trump’s immigration crackdown</a> has largely targeted Hispanic communities. Mexicans, Venezuelans, Guatemalans, Cubans and Hondurans have constituted the bulk of those crossing the southern border in recent years and represent the majority of those returned since January. Masked ICE agents have raided restaurants and hotels across the US, seizing illegal migrants and transferring them to detention centres such as “<a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/833e0b29-e9cc-4eb1-ae2c-a875ff221d2b">Alligator Alcatraz</a>”, a facility deep in the Florida Everglades that a federal judge ordered last month to be shut down.</p>
<p>From these facilities, the illegal migrants have been deported to countries including El Salvador, Rwanda and South Sudan. In the first seven months since Trump returned to the White House, the US has deported nearly 200,000 people, a senior source at the Department of Homeland Security recently told CNN.</p>
<p>Speaking to The Times, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the exiled former oligarch and Putin critic, said he had no problem with Trump’s wider immigration crackdown. But he urged the White House to reconsider its approach to Russians at risk of political persecution.</p>
<figure><picture><figure><img alt="Mikhail Khodorkovsky sitting in a chair in front of blackboards filled with mathematical equations." src="https://www.thetimes.com/imageserver/image/%2F4701b540-1cd9-41f9-ac03-830aadb168a0.jpg?crop=7868%2C5248%2C0%2C0"/><figcaption>Mikhail Khodorkovsky RICHARD POHLE FOR THE TIMES</figcaption></figure></picture></figure>
<p>“Within this broader policy, there is a specific issue concerning individuals from Russia who are seeking political asylum or humanitarian visas,” he said. “This involves around 100,000 people, approximately 5,000 of whom are currently being held in immigration detention facilities.</p>
<p>“Among these 5,000 are several hundred individuals who are genuinely persecuted in Russia for their anti-war and pro-democracy positions.”</p>
<p>Although the deportation of Russians to Russia has accelerated under Trump, the policy began under his predecessor Joe Biden. According to Dmitry Valuev, 46, president of Russian America for Democracy in Russia, an organisation that supports political refugees, deportations under Biden were smaller in number.</p>
<p>He said Russian deportees on those flights avoided returning to Russia by begging for their passports during layovers in China and Morocco and buying flights to alternative destinations.</p>
<figure><picture><figure><img alt="Dmitry Valuev in a video interview." src="https://www.thetimes.com/imageserver/image/%2F8b69dc78-5563-4fc3-864f-6df62a20d86f.jpg?crop=1400%2C854%2C0%2C0"/><figcaption>Dmitry Valuev</figcaption></figure></picture></figure>
<p>However, the US now appears to have enlisted the help of the Egyptian government to ensure the migrants are delivered back to Moscow.</p>
<p>The first mass deportation this year took place in June when 47 Russians were put on a flight to Egypt and returned to Russia via Cairo.</p>
<p>On August 27, between 30 and 60 people were sent to Russia on the same route. Some tried to get off the plane in Cairo but were restrained by Egyptian officials and forced to board the onward flight to Moscow, according to Valuev. He believes that US immigration authorities are now working with the Russian FSB.</p>
<p>“I think the June deportation and the August deportation were co-ordinated with the Russian authorities,” he said. “The middlemen in the US immigration system and the Russian FSB could not talk to each other directly without approval from higher up. Someone gave that approval.”</p>
<p>When the dissidents arrived in Russia, the Russian authorities were given documents relating to their asylum applications in the US. Those dossiers, outlining their political beliefs and criticisms of Putin, could be used to prosecute them back home, campaigners believe.</p>
<p>Khodorkovsky said the treatment of Russian dissidents by the US posed the question of “whether the current administration is prepared to act as a leader of the democratic world”.</p>
<p>He said the deportations were particularly troubling given the Russians were “accompanied by documents that can help fabricate criminal cases against them, and all of this at the expense of the American taxpayer”.</p>
<p>“This is no longer about democratic leadership — it’s about the risk of being seen as an ally of dictators,” he said.</p>
<p>ICE, a branch of the Department of Homeland Security, did not respond to questions about whether they co-operated with Russian authorities on deportations. The US state department declined to comment and referred to the Department of Homeland Security. The Egyptian embassy in Washington was approached for comment.</p>
<p>In a public letter addressed to Mark Carney, the prime minister of Canada, this week, Yulia Navalnaya, Navalny’s widow, pleaded with the Canadian government to resettle hundreds of Russian refugees. The letter, published in The Globe and Mail, was jointly signed by the opposition leaders Vladimir Kara-Murza and Ilya Yashin.</p>
<p>Having helped organise anti-Putin protests outside the Russian embassy in Mexico City after Navalny’s death, Vadim and Yuliya now wonder if their future will resemble the tragic fate of the man who once championed Russia’s democratic hopes.</p>
<p>“I have sacrificed everything to stand up for what is right,” said Vadim. “If that makes me a traitor, so be it.”</p>
