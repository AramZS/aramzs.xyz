<p>Pharmacies and doctors are struggling to adjust to a new regulatory environment for updated coronavirus vaccines that are no longer broadly recommended.</p>
<p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/09/04/rfk-jr-vaccines-cdc-senate-hearing/">told senators</a> this week that anyone can get a new coronavirus vaccine. But many Americans are finding the opposite.</p>
<p>Confusion is rippling through the health care system as pharmacies and doctors try to adjust to providing a vaccine that is no longer broadly recommended. Americans’ experiences vary widely from easily booking appointments to having to cross state lines to access the shots, according to more than 3,200 submissions to The Washington Post’s <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/09/04/coronavirus-vaccines-access-stories/">request for readers</a> to share their experiences.</p>
