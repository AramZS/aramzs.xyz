<p>Selenium WebDriver refers to both the language bindings and the implementations of the individual browser controlling code. This is commonly referred to as just <em>WebDriver</em>.</p>
<p>Selenium WebDriver is a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver1/">W3C Recommendation</a></p>
<ul><li><p>WebDriver is designed as a simple and more concise programming interface.</p></li><li><p>WebDriver is a compact object-oriented API.</p></li><li><p>It drives the browser effectively.</p></li></ul>
<p>If you are new to Selenium, we have a few resources that can help you get up to speed right away.</p>
