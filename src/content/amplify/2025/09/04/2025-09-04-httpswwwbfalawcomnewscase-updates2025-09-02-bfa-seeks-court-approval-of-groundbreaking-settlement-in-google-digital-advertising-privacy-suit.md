  BFA Seeks Court Approval of Groundbreaking Settlement in Google Digital
  Advertising Privacy Suit
---
<p>On September 2, 2025, Bleichmar Fonti &amp; Auld LLP (BFA) and its co-counsel moved the Court to approve a sweeping and significant settlement in <em>In re Google RTB Consumer Privacy Litigation</em>, a nationwide class action challenging Google’s data sharing practices in its real-time bidding (RTB) advertising system. The proposed settlement provides never-before-available relief to the U.S. Google account holders who make up the settlement class.</p>
<p>As part of the agreed-to changes, Google will create a new user control that empowers account holders to limit the information Google shares about them in Google’s RTB. Google will also make substantial changes to its disclosures to provide information about RTB and about the new RTB control. Plaintiffs’ expert estimates the minimum value of the settlement relief to be between $1.4 and $2.9 billion, and the maximum value to be between $18.3 and $21.6 billion—an excellent result by any measure.</p>
<p>BFA has played a leading role in this litigation, with Lesley Weaver serving on the Plaintiffs’ Executive Committee since 2021, and Anne Davis and Josh Samra playing key roles on the litigation team.</p>
<p>The settlement is currently pending approval before Judge Gonzales Rogers of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California.</p>
