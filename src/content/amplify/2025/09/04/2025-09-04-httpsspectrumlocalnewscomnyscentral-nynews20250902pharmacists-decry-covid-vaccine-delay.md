<p>WOODSTOCK, N.Y. – More and more people are asking pharmacist Dr. Neal Smoller if they are eligible for the COVID-19 vaccine.</p>
<p>Smoller, owner of Woodstock's Village Apothecary, said there’s a lot of confusion around who can get the jab this year. He said that's, in part, because Health and Human Services Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr. announced earlier this year that the vaccine would no longer be universally available.</p>
<h4><b>What You Need To Know</b></h4>
<h5><ul> <li>Federal Health and Human Services Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr. fired 17 members of the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices</li> <br/> <li>That committee approves use of vaccines nationwide, including the COVID-19 vaccine </li> <br/> <li>Secretary Kennedy says the firings were necessary to restore public trust</li> <br/> <li>Some pharmacists are decrying the move as an act of vaccine skepticism</li> </ul> </h5>
<p>Now, only people deemed "high-risk," like the elderly or those with comorbidities, can get the shot. That still means most Americans can get a shot, but it has led to many assuming they're not eligible.</p>
<p>“I don't know where I stand," Smoller said. "I'm a health care professional. I'm the person that's out and exposed to the virus the most, being in a public setting and helping to combat the virus, and I won't be eligible based on the FDA's new criteria.”</p>
<p>Smoller calls it an atmosphere of chaos, one that’s extended to health care providers as well.</p>
<p>In June, Kennedy fired 17 members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which recommends how vaccines are used nationwide. It’s led to a delay in the approval of this season’s COVID vaccines. Smoller says he’s worried that they may not be approved at all.</p>
<p>Speaking with national news outlets, Kennedy said the firings were a long time coming.</p>
<p>“We wanted to make sure there are people on that panel for the first time in history that don't have conflicts of interest, that are not making money by voting themselves rich," Kennedy said.</p>
<p>New York state doesn’t specifically require approval from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for providers to give out vaccinations. In a statement, the state Department of Health said it is reviewing the latest federal guidance and will share its analysis once that review is complete.</p>
<p>But Smoller said he’s worried insurance companies may not pay providers for the shots if the CDC doesn’t approve them.</p>
<p>“Vaccination was the one area that was very cut and dry and was consistent, and that was buoying us, keeping us alive," he said. "If that goes away, it's not just, we're not going to make money, it's that we potentially can't survive another year.”</p>
<p>Smoller says this indecision could have a significant effect on public health, especially as overall COVID-19 hospitalizations are down but unvaccinated hospitalizations are up.</p>
<p>“Patients of mine that I've worked very hard to protect over the past five years, blood, sweat and tears, to make sure that the most vulnerable people were protected with these vaccine," he said. "They potentially are going to be at risk right now, right? And I can't do anything about it.”</p>
