<p><b>When Marya Zlatnik meets with women</b> in the early stages of pregnancy, she gives them the standard advice: take prenatal vitamins; avoid alcohol, smoking and eating raw fish. But for certain patients, the maternal fetal medicine specialist at the University of California at San Francisco, who specializes in high-risk pregnancies, adds another warning: Avoid plastic.</p>
<p>That’s easier said than done. Plastic permeates Americans’ lives — it’s in furniture, food packaging, clothing, electronics and even <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/interactive/2024/microplastics-air-human-body-organs-spread/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template">in the air</a>. Zlatnik starts with the low-hanging fruit: Try not to eat or drink from plastic containers. Avoid heating plastic in the microwave. Stay away from highly processed foods.</p>
<p>Some women are receptive; others are not, overwhelmed with too much information and not enough time. But for women who have had at least one premature birth, Zlatnik said, “I want them to have the information.”</p>
<p>She is one of a small number of medical practitioners across the country warning patients about the risk of a set of chemicals found in plastics. Known as phthalates, these compounds are found in the blood and urine of virtually everyone in the United States; nine of them are approved for use in plastics that come in close contact with food. For the last two decades, scientists have gathered growing evidence that these chemicals are linked to a dizzying array of health problems, including premature birth, infertility and ADHD. And the greatest risks — and the most dangerous outcomes — are to pregnant women and their children.</p>
<p>To understand how plastic chemicals are affecting human health, The Washington Post interviewed more than two dozen scientists, former regulators and industry officials, and reviewed nearly 50 academic studies on the health effects of phthalates published in the last 20 years. The investigation revealed strong evidence that the chemicals have harmful effects on babies in utero, even as they continue to be used in food, medical supplies and personal care products.</p>
<p>Scientists are most concerned about the link between exposure to the chemicals during pregnancy and infertility later in life — particularly in males.</p>
<p>Phthalates are part of a group of chemicals known as “endocrine-disruptors” — chemicals that can interfere with the normal functioning of the body’s hormones. Those chemicals are particularly dangerous to developing fetuses, which rely on hormones to shape their growth and development.</p>
<p>“If any of these chemicals get into a woman while she’s pregnant, the chemicals will go right across into the baby,” said Philip Landrigan, a pediatrician and director of the program for Global Public Health and the Common Good at Boston College. “The placenta provides no protection at all.”</p>

<p>Until 10 weeks, the fetus develops mostly in isolation from the mother’s bloodstream. Its nutrients primarily come from the yolk sac.</p>
<p>At this stage, the placenta surrounds the fetus, but it is protected from the mother’s blood by a set of plug structures.</p>
<p>Between weeks 10 and 12 those plugs dissolve, allowing maternal blood to flow in. Chemicals, including phthalates, can then flow from the mother’s bloodstream to the fetus through the placenta and umbilical chord.</p>
<p>Chemicals can also slip through the membrane surrounding the fetus and seep into the amniotic fluid.</p>
<p>Babies exposed to higher levels of phthalates in utero are more likely to be born prematurely, have reproductive problems and infertility later in life, and even be diagnosed with ADHD.</p>
<p>Some people transform their lives to avoid exposure, but the vast majority remain unaware of the risk. At the same time, scientists find it difficult to say what level of phthalates is too high — poor outcomes have been found even at low doses.</p>
<h2>Plastic Peril</h2>
<p>A series on the chemicals that lurk in everyday plastics — and how they affect our health.</p>
<p>Plastics and chemical industry representatives argue that the Food and Drug Administration still considers phthalates safe. A minority of scientists, meanwhile, have questions about whether phthalates are definitively linked to these health conditions.</p>
<p>“Endocrine-disrupting chemicals are one of the biggest global health threats of our time,” said Leonardo Trasande, a professor of pediatrics and population health at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine. “And 2 percent of us know about it — but 99 percent of us are affected by it.”</p>

<p><b>Phthalates (pronounced </b><i><b>tha-lates</b></i><b>) have</b> sometimes been called “everywhere chemicals.” That’s because — while they dissipate quickly in the body — almost everyone on the planet is exposed to them repeatedly and constantly. Phthalates are plasticizers, or chemicals added to some plastics to make them more flexible and stretchy. As a result, they can be found almost anywhere that plastics are used: shower curtains, vinyl flooring, garden hoses, medical devices. Phthalates are also used in lotions, perfumes and almost anything with a fragrance.</p>

<p>But people are mostly exposed through food, especially <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/06/27/ultra-processed-foods-predigested-health-risks/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template">highly processed foods</a> that have passed through numerous packages and conveyor belts of plastic. A <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/health/food-contaminants/the-plastic-chemicals-hiding-in-your-food-a7358224781/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template">study</a> by Consumer Reports last year found phthalates in 84 of 85 grocery and fast foods tested. Another <a href="https://www.plasticlist.org/report?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template">study</a>, by an independent research group in California, found them in about three-quarters of 312 foods tested.</p>
<p>For decades, no one worried that Americans were consuming large quantities of phthalates in their food. Then in the 1980s, Earl Gray, an Environmental Protection Agency toxicologist, began feeding pregnant rats corn oil mixed with the chemicals. There had been murmurings in the scientific community that the chemicals could block development of testosterone; the EPA was tasked with investigating that question.</p>
<p>What Gray found shocked him. Male rats exposed to phthalates in utero, he found, were more likely to have birth defects, including undescended testicles and malformed penises. They also showed another clear sign of disrupted development: a shortened distance between anus and genitals, known by scientists as “anogenital distance,” or AGD. In many species, a shortened AGD is linked to poor sperm counts, infertility and low testosterone levels. Scientists called the condition “phthalate syndrome.”</p>
<p>Then, in the early 2000s, a set of scientists in Denmark began investigating a <a href="https://karger.com/hrp/article-abstract/60/Suppl.%203/49/372405/Testicular-Dysgenesis-Syndrome?redirectedFrom=fulltext&amp;itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template">mysterious set of symptoms</a> in humans. Sperm quality and sperm count were decreasing — according to some research, by as much as 40 percent over just a few decades. Testicular cancers and birth defects were on the rise.</p>
<p>The changes were happening so quickly — over just a generation or two — that they couldn’t be explained by large-scale genetic changes. It had to be either a marked change in lifestyle or environmental exposures. Researchers called the newfound condition “testicular dysgenesis syndrome.” And it looked eerily similar to the symptoms shown by Gray’s rats.</p>

<p><b>Arica Nyamsi has always been concerned</b> about the link between environment and health — her mother died of cancer when she was 4 years old, and she spent some of her teen years struggling with chronic migraines and stomach pain. But the St. Louis dancer and choreographer’s fears escalated when she had a miscarriage in 2022. She began reading about how chemicals — including phthalates — that alter hormone levels can increase the chances of miscarriage.</p>
<p>She and her husband, Wil, had just moved into a new home, and she began replacing everything made of plastic: Tupperware and clothes hangers and polyester clothing. Her 1-year-old’s toys are made of wood and silicone; she avoids any processed foods. Now, almost seven months pregnant with her second child, avoiding plastic has taken on extra urgency.</p>
<p>“I think plastic is the enemy,” Nyamsi said. “It’s the plague of people and the planet.”</p>

<p>Nyamsi is one of thousands of women around the country enrolled in the ECHO program, short for Environmental influences on Child Health Outcomes, a nationwide study launched by the National Institutes of Health. Since she was 12 weeks pregnant, scientists have tracked Nyamsi’s levels of phthalates and a host of other environmental chemicals. Their goal: to connect exposure to chemicals in utero to health problems later in life.</p>
<p>Not everyone is as concerned as Nyamsi. Cassondra Perez, a mother of two in Mahwah, New Jersey, who is also a participant in the study, said that if her doctor gave her clear instructions to avoid plastic, she would — but for now, her children play with plastic toys and drink formula made from bottled water. “I don’t have information on what is good to give to them or not,” she said. “If I did, I would change that.”</p>
<p>Scientists say the most dangerous period of exposure is in the first trimester, before some women even realize that they are pregnant.</p>
<p>In early pregnancy, fetal hormones act like the conductor of an orchestra: They tell tissues to grow, organs to develop; signals to turn on and off. As a result, fetal life is one of a few key periods when endocrine-disrupting chemicals can change the course of human health.</p>
<p>At worst, they can create conditions that follow the baby all the way to adulthood.</p>
<p>“Hormones during development are instructing tissues and organs,” said Terje Svingen, a reproductive toxicologist at the Technical University of Denmark. “That’s where your future is set and laid out.”</p>

<p>Until Week 6, embryos don’t look male or female. Their genitals are an undifferentiated group of bulges and ducts that, depending on their exposure to hormones, can transform into male or female organs.</p>
<p>Starting in Week 6, embryos with a Y chromosome begin producing testosterone. Between eight and 14 weeks, that testosterone signals the genitals to form male anatomy.</p>
<p>Genitals morph into penis, testicles and scrotum. For female fetuses, in the absence of testosterone, genitals develop into clitoris and vulva.</p>
<p>In males, the distance between anus and genitals lengthens more than in females, forming the anogenital distance.</p>
<p>But if a male has inadequate testosterone during that key period, the anogenital distance is shorter — a marker for future fertility problems.</p>
<p>“As a male, you need a certain amount of testosterone during a critical period of development,” said Rod Mitchell, a professor of pediatric endocrinology at the University of Edinburgh. “If you get that, you program your reproductive health normally.”</p>
<p>But phthalates act as antiandrogens, which means they block the development of testosterone. Scientists believe that phthalates interrupt the cells, known as Leydig cells, that manufacture fetal testosterone; but it’s difficult to measure what’s happening within the growing fetus without performing invasive procedures.</p>
<p>Without enough testosterone, testicles don’t descend fully, a condition known as cryptorchidism; sometimes, the urethra emerges on the side of the penis instead of on the tip, a condition known as hypospadias. Later in life, men with these conditions are more likely to suffer from infertility or low sperm counts.</p>
<p>And the strongest marker for low testosterone during that critical period is the same measurement Gray was tracking with his rats: a short anogenital distance.</p>
<p>In 2005, the scientist and statistician Shanna Swan published the first look at AGD and phthalate exposure in humans. In a <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16079079/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template">study</a> of 136 pregnancies across the country, Swan found that women with higher levels of phthalates during pregnancy were more likely to give birth to boys with shortened AGDs, smaller penises and undescended testicles.</p>
<p>Since then, many studies, analyzing thousands of pregnancies, have replicated the connection between AGD and phthalates.</p>

<p>At the same time, sperm counts are dropping worldwide. According to one <a href="https://academic.oup.com/humupd/article/29/2/157/6824414?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template">study</a>, sperm counts dropped 1.2 percent per year between 1973 and 2018 — or a roughly 50 percent decline over 45 years. Sperm quality and concentration are also falling.</p>
<p>It’s difficult to connect sperm counts directly to phthalate exposure in utero — that would require following subjects from pregnancy all the way to young adulthood — but researchers have found consistent evidence that having a shorter AGD is linked to lower sperm counts and sperm quality. Men with AGDs under the median — around <a href="https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/10.1289/ehp.1103421?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template">two inches</a> — are more than seven times as likely to have sperm counts so low they risk infertility; they are also more likely to have male birth defects.</p>
<p>Russ Hauser, a professor of reproductive physiology at Harvard University, said he believes that phthalates are contributing to the overall drop in male fertility. Men are being affected, he added, even without particularly dramatic phthalate exposure. “We’re not seeing this at extremely high or unusual exposures,” he said. “It’s at what we call background or general population levels.”</p>
<p>And it’s not just the reproductive system. Hormones also direct brain development, and growing research over the last few years has found a link between phthalate exposure during pregnancy and ADHD and IQ. In one <a href="https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/10.1289/ehp2358?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template">study</a> of mothers and children in Norway, researchers found that the children of mothers with the highest levels of one phthalate were three times more likely to be diagnosed with ADHD as those with the lowest levels. Another similar <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0114003&amp;itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template#s2">study</a> in New York City found that children of highly exposed mothers had, on average, 7 fewer IQ points than children of mothers only slightly exposed.</p>

<p class="rw-outer-content"><span>Some content could not be imported from the original document.</span> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/interactive/2025/plastic-chemicals-phthalates-pregnancy-infertility/?utm_campaign=wp_the7&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;carta-url=https%3A%2F%2Fs2.washingtonpost.com%2Fcar-ln-tr%2F448ec60%2F68b96ede83e69b319c71f694%2F5ff2f995ae7e8a2a74ef10b3%2F47%2F107%2F68b96ede83e69b319c71f694">View content ↗ </a></p>
<p>“We found that higher exposure to phthalates was associated with behaviors that looked like ADHD,” said Stephanie Engel, a professor of reproductive epidemiologyat the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. “More inattentive, more hyperactive, more disruptive behaviors at home and at school.”</p>
<p>Not all studies on brain development agree; some show different findings for boys and girls. But Engel said the same patterns repeat in different research. “Many of them find something related to the same four or five phthalates,” she explained. “They come up over and over again.”</p>
<p>The chemicals can also change the pattern of birth itself. In one <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2794076?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template">study</a> of more than 6,000 participants, high phthalate exposure in utero was linked to a 12 to 16 percent increase in the likelihood of premature birth. Another study that built on those findings found that the chemicals were probably causing around 56,000 premature births every year in the United States. Those premature births are, in turn, linked to long-term challenges including neurological damage, asthma and behavioral problems. Researchers believe the chemicals are causing oxidative stress that could trigger damage to the fetal membranes, leading to early delivery.</p>
<p>“Having an increase of 15 percent in preterm birth is huge for the overall population,” said Kelly Ferguson, a senior investigator at the NIH. “There’s health consequences for children and moms, financial costs.”</p>

<p><b>One of the struggles scientists face</b> is identifying what level of phthalates poses a serious danger. Every person is different, and health is based on a complicated equation of genetic susceptibility and exposure. “We’re always comparing to the average in the general population,” said Sheela Sathyanarayana, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Washington. “But for some people, the average is potentially harmful, and for others it’s not harmful.”</p>
<p>DEHP, or di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, is one of the most frequently studied and most dangerous phthalates. Most research has found that the worst harms occur at urinary levels of more than 300 nanograms per milliliter for DEHP. But the problem for patients is that hospitals and doctors don’t do a routine phthalate test, leaving many women uncertain what their exposure is.</p>
<p>Not all researchers believe that phthalates are causing health problems. The research is challenging since it would be unethical to directly expose a mother to phthalates and track how it affected her child’s health. And it’s impossible to find a true control group, as almost every pregnant woman is exposed to some level of phthalates. Scientists can only piece together evidence from a range of sources: animal studies, epidemiological studies, toxicology.</p>
<p>Mitchell, at the University of Edinburgh, believes that something is altering men’s reproductive health and that it may be an environmental chemical — but not necessarily phthalates. Mice, he pointed out, respond to phthalates less strongly than rats. And a mother who is exposed to high amounts of phthalates, he noted, is likely to be exposed to other chemicals as well.</p>
<p>“We’re just constantly exposed to a soup of chemicals,” he said.</p>

<p>Other researchers counter that the evidence has only grown over the past two decades — and that, with so many documented effects, it’s hard to believe that phthalates don’t cause any health harms. “It’s the weight of the combined evidence,” said Svingen, of the Technical University of Denmark.</p>
<p>Industry representatives argue that phthalates still provide a key role in plastics. Kevin Ott, a spokesperson for the Flexible Vinyl Alliance, pointed out that the chemicals are essential components in blood bags and medical devices, which save lives. “Those benefits should be weighed against the concerns with phthalates,” he said in an email.</p>
<p>The American Chemistry Council’s High Phthalates Panel said in a statement that some newer types of phthalates, including DINP and DIDP, have not been linked to reproductive harms or neurodevelopment. Under the Biden administration, the panel noted, “EPA determined that DINP and DIDP do not pose unreasonable risk of injury to human health for consumers, the general population or to the environment.”</p>
<p>Trasande, the NYU professor, compares the growing research around plastic chemicals to early understanding of lung cancer and smoking. Just as in an individual case of lung cancer can’t be definitively linked to smoking, it will never be possible to say an individual baby was definitively harmed by phthalates. But at the population level, scientists can see telltale signs that those chemicals are undermining human health, adding to growing male infertility or growing cases of ADHD.</p>
<p>“What if there were just a 50 percent probability that phthalates are toxic to reproductive development in boys?” Trasande said. “If it were your grandchild or child, would you allow that to happen?”</p>
<p>For her part, Nyamsi knows her approach to plastic isn’t for everyone. She sometimes feels alienated from friends and other mom groups; she and Wil have tussled over the high cost of replacing plastic items with wood or cotton. “It can be a little isolating being the one that’s a stickler on all the things,” she said.</p>
<p>But once she learned about the risks of plastic, she felt she couldn’t go back. Earlier this year, she choreographed a dance for her troupe that focused on the everyday risks of endocrine-disrupting chemicals. “I feel like at some point in your life, something happens, and then the only thing that matters is your health,” she said. “And that’s where I am now.”</p>

<p>Doctors and researchers continue to wrestle with how to advise pregnant women to protect themselves. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists now advises OB/GYNs to consider asking all their patients about environmental exposures, including screening patients for personal care products or fast food that might contain phthalates. But the chemicals are everywhere. Even someone who avoids plastic entirely may still face exposure from household dust or dairy and meat products that were processed in plastic.</p>
<p>“I prefer not to put the burden on the pregnant person,” said Ferguson, of the NIH. “We need policy change.”</p>
<p>And, despite decades of studies on phthalates, the federal government has placed few restrictions on the use of the chemicals. In 2017, the Consumer Product Safety Commission prohibited the use of five phthalates in children’s toys. But the chemicals are still allowed to come in close contact with food that children and their mothers eat every day. The FDA has repeatedly denied petitions from environmental and health groups to reevaluate the chemicals’ safety.</p>
<p>Asked for comment about the chemicals’ safety, FDA spokesman Andrew Nixon said in a statement, “The agency remains aware of concerns raised about possible health effects of exposure to high levels of phthalates and is working on an updated safety assessment of the nine remaining authorized uses of phthalates.”</p>
<p>Many scientists have heavily critiqued the agency’s lack of action on the chemicals. In one analysis, researchers estimated that phthalates contributed to 100,000 additional cases of male infertility in 2018.</p>
<p>“I believe in the precautionary principle, which means you act in the presence of concerning evidence,” said Linda Birnbaum, a toxicologist and the former director of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. “I don’t have to wait to see dead bodies in order to do something.”</p>
