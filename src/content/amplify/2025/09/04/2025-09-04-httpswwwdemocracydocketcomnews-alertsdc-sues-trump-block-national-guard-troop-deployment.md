<p>The District of Columbia <a data-id="https://assets.bwbx.io/documents/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/rNPkvNYOa_wM/v0" data-type="link" href="https://assets.bwbx.io/documents/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/rNPkvNYOa_wM/v0">sued</a> President Donald Trump Thursday to end his deployment of thousands of National Guard troops in the nation’s capital.</p>
<p>The lawsuit alleges the president and his allies violated federal law and the district’s sovereignty by using over 2,200 National Guard troops from several different states to conduct law enforcement activities in the district.</p>
<p>“The deployment also risks inflaming tensions and fueling distrust toward local law enforcement. And it inflicts economic injuries, depressing business activities and tourism that form the backbone of the local economy and tax base,” the lawsuit reads. “No American jurisdiction should be involuntarily subjected to military occupation.”</p>
<p>“The residents and leaders of the District of Columbia have not requested any of this,” it continues.</p>
<p>Trump has cited out-of-control crime to justify his takeover. But as Democracy Docket has <a href="https://www.democracydocket.com/analysis/the-states-sending-troops-to-dc-have-way-worse-crime-problems-most-didnt-want-to-talk-about-it/">reported</a>, many of the states that sent troops to help occupy D.C. have cities with higher crime rates than the district’s.</p>
