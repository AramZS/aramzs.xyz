<p>The restaurant openings we’re excited about this month bring comfort food to U Street and French cuisine to Adams Morgan.</p>
<p>Craving crispy buffalo wings and meat-sauced garbage plates flanked by cold brews? Prefer to sip grand cru bubblies while nibbling on zesty lamb tartare and juicy escargot? Either way, these new D.C. restaurants have got it covered.</p>
<h2 data-apitype="header" data-contentid="HIO5AT6HDVBBXOG2LAZ3A3EGRU" data-testid="article-header">Upstate FTW</h2>
<p>Having put his stamp on breakfast, lunch and dinner at neighborhood favorites <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/interactive/2024/best-breakfast-sandwiches-dc-area-review-2024/">I Egg You</a>, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/food/part-chinese-part-korean-chiko-branches-out-from-capitol-hill/2019/03/21/5dfba064-4760-11e9-8aab-95b8d80a1e4f_story.html">Chiko</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/food/interactive/2024/best-dc-restaurants/?itid=sr_4_78619f59-3023-4c33-b7d6-6aed0d7641cc#anju">Anju</a>, respectively, Fried Rice Collective co-founder Scott Drewno is now turning his attention to Buffalonian barflies in need of some home cooking.</p>
<p>“We want to do a little wing emporium,” the New York native says of Upstate FTW (short for For the Win), a collaborative venture giving Drewno’s crew control of the food at the existing Sports &amp; Social location on U Street NW. The culinary changeover, which debuts to the general public Thursday, involves remaking the menu into a reflection of Drewno’s youth — including the cut-rate garbage plates ($5.75 a pop) he says he lived on during his college years.</p>
<p>“You just gotta get after it,” Drewno says of the legendary late-night mash-up featuring two cheeseburgers, home fries, macaroni salad and a meaty chili made with 70-30 ground beef browned in chicken stock and seasoned with chili powder, cayenne, garlic, mustard and more.</p>
<p>There are also buffalo wings — “we’re not going to take shortcuts,” Drewno told The Washington Post, estimating that each batch of brined, dried and fried-to-order chicken wings will take 20-plus minutes from start to finish — that have been amped up with some proprietary spices. He says the fire sauce, which combines Thai chiles (dry and fresh), jalapeños, garlic, ginger and more, was crafted “for the heatheads,” while a dry rub kicks things up a notch with black pepper, kosher salt, Korean chile flakes and dehydrated Frank’s RedHot seasoning.</p>
<p>Upstate’s beef on weck sandwich is a team effort stuffing slow-smoked pit beef supplied by <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2022/02/03/best-barbecue-dc-maryland-virginia-2022/">2Fifty Texas BBQ</a> into custom kummelweck rolls with “caraway seeds and crunchy salt baked on the top” made by Pops Bakery in Northeast, all accompanied by grated horseradish and au jus on the side. “It’s just better that way,” Drewno says.</p>
<p>Other staples include baked rigatoni with pulled roast chicken, hot and sweet peppers, and spicy tomato oil; shareable French bread pizzas (pepperoni, margherita-style and four-cheese options); mustard-and onion-topped Zweigle’s hot dogs (red and white hot); queso and chili-topped nachos; Maryland-style crab dip served with garlic crostini; housemade New York-style cheesecake; and a skillet chocolate chip cookie à la mode.</p>

<p>The way Omar Popal sees it, his family-run hospitality group <i>had</i> to breathe new life into the old Habana Village space.</p>
<p>“It’s a gem of a restaurant. We just kind of want to beautify it a bit,” Popal says of the renovated three-story brownstone that’s being converted, in phases, into a neighborhood wine bar (first floor), upscale French dining room (second floor; opening early 2026) and wine dinners/private events space (third floor; late 2026).</p>
<p>The first part, scheduled to debut Sept. 13, picks up where its <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/food/lutece-restaurant-review/2021/02/04/894b6c5e-6243-11eb-9430-e7c77b5b0297_story.html">Georgetown sibling</a> leaves off. “This is going to be like the fun, rowdier version of what Lutèce is,” Popal said of Maison’s raison d'être, stressing that “we’re not going to take reservations; you’re going to come in and just have a beautiful, lively bar.” The beverage program features nearly a dozen imported champagnes, a full complement of aged cognacs and Armagnacs as well as signature cocktails and spirit-free drinks created by Popal Group beverage director Suzy Critchlow.</p>
<p>“If you just want to come in and just slowly drink one glass, you’re welcome to. If you just want to nibble on a couple things, you’re welcome to,” Popal says.</p>
<p>Executive chef Matt Conroy told The Post that the focus is on “modern French food,” citing the Michelin-starred <a href="https://www.fourhorsemenbk.com/">Four Horsemen</a> in New York City as a source of inspiration. Initial offerings are likely to include housemade country terrine accompanied by cherry moustarde and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/food/2023/07/27/how-to-make-gribiche/">gribiche</a>, lamb tartare freshened by herby persillade, crunchy smoked eel croquettes, and a brioche-stuffed chicken and mushroom dish that drew rave reviews earlier this year.</p>
<p>“We served probably 25 people at Lutèce the chicken. And I think 10 of them said it was the best roast chicken they’ve ever had in their life,” Conroy says of the savory showstopper.</p>
<p>Still hungry? Conroy suggests saving room for a dark chocolate torte bolstered by hazelnut, cherries and marsala wine.</p>
