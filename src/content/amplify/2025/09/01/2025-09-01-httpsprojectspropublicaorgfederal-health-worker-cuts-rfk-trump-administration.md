  More than 20,500 workers have left or been pushed out of federal health
  agencies, a ProPublica analysis found. Staffers say the cuts will leave their
  agencies less equipped to conduct studies, perform inspections and combat
  deadly outbreaks.

title: How Many Federal Health Workers Have RFK Jr. and the Trump Administration Cut?

<div><div><p>The analysis is an undercount — it doesn’t include the hundreds or <a href="https://www.govexec.com/workforce/2025/05/agencies-are-violating-law-administrative-leave-and-taxpayers-are-paying-price/405486/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">even thousands</a> of workers who have received layoff notices but remain on administrative leave.</p><p>No health agency has been spared, with some important divisions losing more than 1 in 5 workers. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in charge of public health, lost 15% of its staff; the National Institutes of Health, the <a href="https://siepr.stanford.edu/publications/policy-brief/encouraging-edge-science-through-nih-funding-practices" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">largest funder of biomedical research</a> in the world, 16%; and the Food and Drug Administration, which ensures the safety of most of what goes into people’s bodies — from baby formula to cancer drugs to hip implants — 21%.</p><p>Thousands of these employees were laid off or had their contracts cut, while some took buyouts or retired earlier than anticipated. Divisions have experienced a brain drain of epic proportions, ProPublica found, losing senior leaders behind some of the biggest health initiatives of the modern era, like the rapid rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine.</p><p>Many of the cuts <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/rfk-jr-autism-environment-research-funding">contradict what the administration has said about its priorities</a>.</p><p>The secretary who has <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/whooping-cough-measles-outbreak-vaccine-hesitancy-trump">questioned the safety of vaccines</a> has pushed out scores of regulators who work to make vaccines safe. And while he has declared a new era in the fight against chronic disease, he has decimated a center dedicated to that very goal.</p><p>Division leaders and staffers told ProPublica the cuts will lead their agencies to neglect their duties: Federal researchers will conduct fewer clinical trials and studies, regulators will conduct fewer or less-thorough inspections of egg farms and <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/fda-cuts-drug-factory-inspections">foreign drug factories</a>, and public health specialists will be less prepared to combat outbreaks of deadly viruses. With exit and severance packages pending, many former and current workers would only speak anonymously, out of fear of retribution.</p><p>HHS did not dispute the findings of ProPublica’s analysis and didn’t directly respond to questions about the consequences of the cuts of thousands of scientists, public health specialists and safety inspectors. HHS also did not respond to our questions about why it wouldn’t share data on workforce reductions. A spokesperson for the department said the idea that Kennedy is weakening public health is “dishonest.”</p><p>“Yes, we’ve made cuts — to bloated bureaucracies that were long overdue for accountability,” the spokesperson said in an email. “At the same time, we are working to redirect resources to science that delivers measurable impact, rebuilds public trust, and helps Make America Healthy Again.”</p><p>Former health secretary Xavier Becerra, who served under President Joseph Biden until earlier this year, called the cuts reckless.</p><p>“Public health isn’t a luxury — it’s a core function of government,” he said. “This hollowing out of expertise could leave us dangerously exposed. It takes years to build a professional workforce with the technical knowledge and public trust these roles require. Once you lose that, it’s not easy to get back.”</p></div></div>
