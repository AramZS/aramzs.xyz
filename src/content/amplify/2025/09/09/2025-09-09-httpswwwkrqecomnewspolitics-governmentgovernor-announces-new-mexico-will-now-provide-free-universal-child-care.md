<p><a href="https://www.krqe.com/tag/new-mexico/?ipid=dateline">NEW MEXICO</a> (KRQE) – New Mexico is becoming the first state in the U.S. to offer free early childhood education to every family in the state. Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham announced a universal child care plan that includes higher pay for pre-K educators.</p>
<p><em>Story continues below</em></p>
<p>Starting in November, all New Mexico families, regardless of income, will be able to enroll their kids in pre-K for free. The governor announced they will be investing in more early education programs and facilities. “Universal access, free childcare for every New Mexico family in the state of New Mexico, that starts in New Mexico for the country,” said Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham (D-New Mexico).</p>
<p>It’s an announcement that Governor Lujan Grisham said will change lives across the state, especially for families struggling to make ends meet. Starting in November, the Early Childhood Education and Care Department will implement free childcare across the board. “It is the backbone of creating a system of support for families that allow them to work, to go to college, and do all of the things that they need to do,” said Governor Lujan Grisham.</p>
<p>In recent years, the state expanded no-cost childcare to more households, so, for example, a family of three making less than $100,000 a year would qualify. But, the governor said that still left many New Mexicans straining to cover childcare. Now the state is lifting that income cap.</p>

<p>The state said this will lead to an annual family savings of $12,000 per child. “It’s the difference between moving up into the next affordable house, it’s the difference between ever being able to go on vacation, it’s the difference between making it when inflation in this country remains too high,” said Governor Lujan Grisham.</p>
<p>The governor also announced initiatives to build and renovate childcare facilities through a $13 million low-interest loan fund, along with an additional $20 million she’s asking lawmakers to approve in next year’s budget. Incentive payments will also be available for providers who give early education teachers a minimum of $18 an hour pay rate and offer 10 hours of care per day, five days a week.</p>
<p>“For far too long, we have treated these professionals as babysitters and even called them such, paying them minimum wage or far below the compensation levels for professionals that we’ve entrusted to create the neuroscience, opportunities, and outcomes for little ones,” said Governor Lujan Grisham.</p>
<p>The governor said both state and federal funds will be used to pay for the initiative, as well as the state’s early childhood trust fund. She is calling on lawmakers to approve another $120 million to fully fund the program. The state estimates an additional 5,000 professionals are needed to fully run the universal child care system. They said they are launching a campaign to recruit providers.</p>
