<p>Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee in the New York City mayoral race, is way ahead of his three rivals, but his lead would diminish considerably if the field shrank to a two-man race.</p>

<p>Zohran Mamdani has opened a commanding lead in the race for mayor of New York City, buoyed by support for his affordability platform and by the splintered opposition, according to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/09/09/polls/nyc-mayor-poll-likely-voters.html">a new survey by The New York Times and Siena College</a>.</p>
<p>The poll found that 46 percent of likely voters currently planned to choose Mr. Mamdani, the Democratic nominee, in a four-way race. His support spans racial and ethnic groups but is especially strong among young and highly educated voters.</p>
<p>By comparison, 24 percent of likely voters in New York City said they would support former Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who is running as an independent after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/25/nyregion/cuomo-mamdani-mayor-primary-nyc.html">losing June’s Democratic primary</a>; 15 percent would back the Republican candidate, Curtis Sliwa; and 9 percent favored Mayor Eric Adams, the scandal-scarred incumbent who is also running on an independent line.</p>
<p>The survey captured the state of the race in early September at a moment of unusual flux. The day after polling began, The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/03/nyregion/trump-adams-sliwa-quit-nyc-mayor.html">reported</a> that President Trump and powerful figures in New York City were endeavoring to create a one-on-one contest between Mr. Cuomo, 67, and Mr. Mamdani, a 33-year-old state assemblyman and democratic socialist.</p>
<p>The extraordinary effort has included negotiations about Mr. Adams potentially suspending his campaign and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/05/nyregion/eric-adams-saudi-arabia-ambassador.html">accepting a nomination</a> to be ambassador to Saudi Arabia. Presidential advisers have also discussed strategies <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/03/nyregion/trump-adams-sliwa-quit-nyc-mayor.html">to try to push Mr. Sliwa out</a> of the race.</p>
<p>The Times/Siena College poll underscored the potential impact of shrinking the field. Doing so, it suggested, could meaningfully erode Mr. Mamdani’s lead, but only if both Mr. Adams and Mr. Sliwa — who have vowed to keep running — suspended their campaigns.</p>
<p>In a hypothetical head-to-head matchup, voters who initially supported Mr. Adams and Mr. Sliwa broke heavily toward Mr. Cuomo, a moderate Democrat. The survey suggested that would lead to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/09/upshot/poll-nyc-mamdani-cuomo.html">an extremely tight race</a>, with 48 percent supporting Mr. Mamdani and 44 percent supporting Mr. Cuomo.</p>
<p>But if Mr. Adams dropped out and Mr. Sliwa stayed in the race, Mr. Mamdani would likely still hold a comfortable lead given Mr. Adams’s relatively low level of support.</p>
<p>With just under two months to go until Election Day, the race has already been one of the most tumultuous New York City has seen in decades. It has included <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/eric-adams-indictment-timeline.html">short-lived corruption charges</a> against Mr. Adams, a comeback attempt by Mr. Cuomo four years after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/10/nyregion/andrew-cuomo-resigns.html">he resigned</a> as governor in scandal and the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/01/nyregion/how-mamdani-won-campaign-mayor.html">unexpected rise of Mr. Mamdani</a>.</p>
<p>The Times/Siena College survey is among a handful of independent polls of the race in recent weeks, and showed a somewhat larger lead for Mr. Mamdani than others <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/polls/nyc-mayoral-election-polls-2025.html">tracked by The Times</a>.</p>
<p>The new poll suggested Mr. Mamdani’s success so far is rooted in two factors: voters’ personal regard for him and their sense that he is best positioned to address two of their top electoral issues, affordability and housing costs.</p>

<p>Around 60 percent of likely voters said Mr. Mamdani was inspirational, had good character and cared about people like them. He is the only candidate viewed positively by a majority of voters, despite months of attacks against him.</p>
<p>And Mr. Mamdani has an edge with all racial groups, leading Mr. Cuomo narrowly among Black voters (Mr. Adams, the city’s second Black mayor, trails in third), and by a larger margin among Hispanic voters.</p>
<p>Overall, voters said they trusted Mr. Mamdani over Mr. Cuomo 49 percent to 23 percent when it comes to handling the city’s daunting affordability challenge, with the other candidates lagging behind.</p>
<p>Mr. Mamdani’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/28/nyregion/mamdani-policies-economy-housing-buses-childcare.html">proposal to freeze increases</a> on rent-stabilized units wins particularly strong public support. Nearly 70 percent of voters — including majorities of Cuomo and Adams supporters — favor the policy. Increasing taxes on the wealthiest New Yorkers, as Mr. Mamdani has proposed, is also widely popular, the poll found.</p>
<p>Faith Dulaurier, 24, a teacher from Flushing in Queens, said Mr. Mamdani’s focus on affordability and his frequent appearances around the city had won her over, even though she is not registered with a party.</p>
<p>“I want to see something new, different, actually active change,” she said.</p>
<p>By a large margin, likely voters also said Mr. Mamdani was the candidate who had best addressed the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians. Forty-three percent favored his position, compared with 16 percent for Mr. Cuomo.</p>
<p>Mr. Mamdani has been among the most outspoken proponents of Palestinian rights and a longtime critic of Israel, describing its war efforts in Gaza as genocide. Mr. Cuomo is a staunch ally of Israel, and has volunteered to defend its leader, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, from war crimes accusations.</p>
<p>Still, the poll registered potential vulnerabilities for the front-runner, too.</p>
<p>Voters have doubts about whether Mr. Mamdani, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/28/nyregion/mamdani-record-albany-mayor.html">a three-term state lawmaker</a> with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/10/nyregion/mamdani-age-mayor-young.html">a sparse résumé</a>, can deliver on his ambitious campaign plans. Roughly two-thirds of likely voters — including more than half of Mr. Mamdani’s own supporters — said they do not expect him to achieve everything he has promised.</p>
<p>Some 57 percent of likely voters also said New York City should not follow through on Mr. Mamdani’s plan to make buses free for everyone, even as a majority of New Yorkers support the proposal in theory.</p>

<p>And they were divided over his affiliation with the Democratic Socialists of America, a leftist group. About 37 percent of likely voters said having a democratic socialist as mayor would be a good thing for the city, compared with 32 percent who said it would be a bad thing and 26 percent who called it neither good or bad.</p>
<p>Despite <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/06/24/us/elections/results-new-york-primary.html">Mr. Cuomo’s primary loss</a>, the survey suggested that he had more room to increase his support before Election Day than Mr. Adams or Mr. Sliwa.</p>
<p>The former governor has taken a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/18/nyregion/cuomo-campaign-strategy-mayor.html">far more aggressive approach</a> in recent weeks to try to convince voters that Mr. Mamdani is too inexperienced and too ideologically left-leaning to lead a global financial capital.</p>
<p>Mr. Cuomo, who spent a decade leading the state, receives high marks on his ability to govern. Roughly 57 percent of likely voters said the phrase “would be an effective mayor” described him well.</p>
<p>Rodrigo Tobar, 64, of Queens, said he planned to support Mr. Sliwa, but was open to voting for Mr. Cuomo because of his experience.</p>
<p>“I like Sliwa because he is on the side of Trump, and I like anyone on the side of Trump,” said Mr. Tobar, who works at Elmhurst Hospital. “But Cuomo did a great job as governor; I think he could be a good mayor.”</p>
<p>Roughly two-thirds of voters support <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/14/nyregion/cuomo-mamdani-zohrans-law.html">a proposal by Mr. Cuomo</a> to limit who can lease the city’s nearly one million rent-stabilized apartments to those who would be spending at least 30 percent of their income on rent. Mr. Cuomo named the plan after Mr. Mamdani <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/12/nyregion/cuomo-mamdani-rent-stabilized.html">to draw attention</a> to his rival’s living in a rent-stabilized unit despite his six-figure state salary.</p>
<p>Mr. Cuomo’s plan to hire 5,000 more police officers is also popular and has support from many of Mr. Mamdani’s backers.</p>
<p>But there are signs that key lines of attack by Mr. Cuomo are not working. He has spent months criticizing Mr. Mamdani for his past support for defunding the Police Department (a position the assemblyman <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/30/nyregion/mamdani-uganda-return-officer.html">has since reversed</a>) and argued that his rival would be ill equipped to go toe-to-toe with Mr. Trump.</p>

<p>Yet voters said they trusted the men equally to handle crime, and slightly favor Mr. Mamdani over Mr. Cuomo when it comes to dealing with the Trump administration.</p>
<p>And though the issue has faded from the public debate, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/06/06/nyregion/andrew-cuomo-sexual-harassment-claims.html">sexual harassment accusations</a> that ended Mr. Cuomo’s governorship continue to haunt his candidacy. Mr. Cuomo says he was unfairly framed, but more than 80 percent of voters believe he did something wrong or illegal.</p>
<p>The electorate has a still more jaundiced view of Mr. Adams after nearly four years in office and a drumbeat of corruption allegations around City Hall.</p>
<p>Nearly 50 percent of New Yorkers said they would never consider supporting him, higher than any other candidate. And he does not gain traction in the poll on any single issue, despite succeeding in improving key crime metrics.</p>
<p>After an extensive mayoral lobbying campaign, the Trump administration intervened earlier this year to get the corruption charges against the mayor <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/02/nyregion/eric-adams-case-dismissed.html">dismissed</a> so he could help enforce the president’s deportation agenda.</p>
<p>But the case continues to plague his bid for re-election. Only 10 percent of likely voters in New York City say Mr. Adams did nothing wrong.</p>
<p>As for Mr. Sliwa, a majority of voters believe he has good character and cares about people. But in a city where registered Democrats outnumber Republicans six to one, the survey showed he had few pathways to expand his support. Even Republican voters seem to doubt his chances: Only 56 percent said they planned to vote for their party’s nominee in November.</p>

<h3>Here are the key things to know about this Times/Siena poll:</h3>
<ul><li><p>The survey was conducted among 1,284 New York City likely voters from Sept. 2 to Sept. 6, 2025.</p></li></ul>
<ul><li><p>This poll was conducted in English and Spanish, by telephone using live interviewers and by text message. Overall, more than 99 percent of respondents were contacted on their cellphone. You can see the exact questions that were asked and the order in which they were asked <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/09/09/polls/nyc-mayor-poll-likely-voters.html">here</a>.</p></li></ul>
<ul><li><p>Voters are selected for the survey from a list of registered voters. The list contains information on the demographic characteristics of every registered voter, allowing us to make sure we reach the right number of voters of each party, race and borough. For this poll, interviewers placed more than 163,000 calls or texts to more than 81,000 voters.</p></li></ul>
<ul><li><p>To further ensure that the results reflect the entire voting population, not just those willing to take a poll, we give more weight to respondents from demographic groups that are underrepresented among survey respondents, like people without a college degree. You can see more information about the characteristics of our respondents and the weighted sample at the bottom of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/09/09/polls/nyc-mayor-poll-likely-voters.html">methodology page</a>, under “Composition of the Sample.”</p></li></ul>
<ul><li><p>The margin of sampling error among the electorate that is likely to vote in November is about plus or minus 3.6 percentage points. In theory, this means that the results should reflect the views of the overall population most of the time, though many other challenges create additional sources of error. When the difference between two values is computed — such as a candidate’s lead in a race — the margin of error is twice as large.</p></li></ul>
