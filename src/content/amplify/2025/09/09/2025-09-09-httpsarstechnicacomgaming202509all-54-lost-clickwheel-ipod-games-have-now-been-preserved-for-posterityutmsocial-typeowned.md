title: All 54 lost clickwheel iPod games have now been preserved for posterity
---
<div><div>
<p>Last year, we reported on <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/11/ipod-fans-evade-apples-drm-to-preserve-54-lost-clickwheel-era-games/">the efforts of classic iPod fans to preserve playable copies of the downloadable clickwheel games</a> that Apple sold for a brief period in the late '00s. The community was working to get around <a href="http://www.roughlydrafted.com/RD/Home/728B5C4B-0A35-40BE-A2E7-E5464C68B80A.html">Apple's onerous FairPlay DRM</a> by having people who still owned original copies of those (now unavailable) games sync their accounts to a single iTunes installation <a href="https://github.com/Olsro/ipodclickwheelgamespreservationproject/tree/main">via a coordinated Virtual Machine</a>. That "master library" would then be able to provide playable copies of those games to any number of iPods in perpetuity.</p>
<p>At the time, the community was still searching for iPod owners with syncable copies of the last few titles needed for their library. With <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ipod/comments/1nb9kvx/comment/nd2dozi/">today's addition of <em>Real Soccer 2009</em></a> to the project, though, all 54 official iPod clickwheel games are now available together in an easily accessible format for what is likely the first time.</p><p></p>
<h2>All at once, then slowly</h2>
<p>GitHub user Olsro, the originator of <a href="https://github.com/Olsro/ipodclickwheelgamespreservationproject/tree/main">the iPod Clickwheel Games Preservation Project</a>, tells Ars that he lucked into contact with three people who had large iPod game libraries in the first month or so after the project's launch last October. That includes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@thatnostalgicnerd">one YouTuber</a> who had purchased and maintained copies of 39 distinct games, even repurchasing some of the upgraded versions Apple sold separately for later iPod models.</p>
<p>Ars' <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/11/ipod-fans-evade-apples-drm-to-preserve-54-lost-clickwheel-era-games/">story on the project</a> shook out a few more iPod owners with syncable iPod game libraries, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ipod/comments/1giaocx/release_3_ipod_clickwheel_games_lode_runner_star/">subsequent</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ipod/comments/1gk4imk/release_5_new_ipod_clickwheel_games_bubble_bash/">updates</a> in the following days left just a handful of titles unpreserved. But that's when the project stalled, Olsro said, with months wasted on false leads and technical issues that hampered the effort to get a complete library.</p>
<p>"I've put a lot of time into coaching people that [had problems] transferring the files and authorizing the account once with me on the [Virtual Machine]," Olsro told Ars. "But I kept motivation to continue coaching anyone else coming to me (by mail/Discord) and making regular posts to increase awareness until I could find finally someone that could, this time, go with me through all the steps of the preservation process," he <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ipod/comments/1nb9kvx/comment/nd2dozi">added on Reddit</a>.</p>

<p>Getting working access to the final unpreserved game, <em>Real Soccer 2009</em>, was "especially cursed," Olsro tells Ars. "Multiple [people] came to me during this summer and all attempts failed until a new one from yesterday," he said. "I even had a situation when someone had an iPod Nano 5G with a playable copy of <em>Real Soccer</em>, but the drive was appearing empty in the Windows Explorer. He tried recovery tools &amp; the iPod NAND just corrupted itself, asking for recovery..."</p>
