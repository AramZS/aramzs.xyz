<p>September 9, 2025 at 6:03 a.m. EDT18 minutes ago</p>
<p>Claiming the nation’s capital was overrun with “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/08/12/dc-crime-trump-maga/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template">bloodthirsty criminals</a>,” President Donald Trump seized control of the D.C. police department and deployed the National Guard to city streets last month.</p>
<p>In the 30 days since Trump’s extraordinary exertion of federal power — ignited in part by the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/08/05/trump-doge-worker-washington-dc-crime/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template">attempted carjacking </a>of Edward Coristine, a former DOGE employee — daily life in D.C. has changed in ways big and small. Camouflage-clad National Guard troops <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/09/02/metro-stations-dc-national-guard/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template">patrol the Metro</a>. Federal immigration officers have <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/08/21/dc-police-ice-moped-crackdown-delivery-drivers/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template">seized people</a> from their homes and cars, incidents that have drawn boos from crowds ready to record.</p>
<p>Local leaders, with few avenues to stave off intervention, have criticized the president to various degrees. Mayor <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/09/07/mayor-bowser-trump-dc-takeover/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template">Muriel E. Bowser</a> (D) has called the declared emergency unneeded — but also expressed gratitude for the boosted federal law enforcement presence.</p>
<p>White House officials say their operation in D.C. has yielded at least 2,120 arrests and 214 gun seizures. Fifty homeless encampments have been cleared. Trump continues to muse about deploying troops to other cities, offering his administration’s actions in the nation’s capital as a test case.</p>
<p>While some residents have expressed support for the increased law enforcement presence, others <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/08/12/dc-police-trump-federal-takeover-reaction/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template">largely oppose</a> the crackdown. They have hung <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/08/30/dc-flags-resistance-trump-federal-takeover/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template">the D.C. flag</a> from their porches, scribbled signs to warn drivers about <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/08/14/dc-checkpoint-homeland-security-trump/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template">Immigration and Customs Enforcement checkpoints </a>and put up posters depicting the former Justice Department employee who <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/08/21/subway-guy-dc-trump-federal-takeover/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template">flung a sandwich</a> at a federal officer.</p>
<p>Now, Trump is talking about sending National Guard troops and federal agents to other cities, saying his actions in D.C. offer a template.</p>
<h3 data-component="Heading" data-contentid="EW3YYCF6CRCCPFHWPLUEVELXIY" data-file="custom-template-components/src/Heading/Heading.js" data-style="stitches">Aug. 11 | Day 1</h3>
<p>Trump orders federal takeover of D.C. police, deploys National Guard</p>
<p>Trump declares a crime emergency in D.C. and says he is deploying the D.C. National Guard and sending more federal agents into city streets. He invokes Section 740 of the Home Rule Act, which gives the president the authority to take control of the city’s police department for 30 days.</p>
<p>Protesters gather blocks away from the White House. Bowser, joined at a news conference by Police Chief Pamela A. Smith, describes Trump’s actions as “unsettling and unprecedented” but also frames it as a possible “opportunity.” The police union says it supports the surge.</p>
<p>The two Maryland teens charged in the attempted carjacking of Coristine have their <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/08/11/teens-charged-doge-attack-trump/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template">first court hearing</a>. They are ordered to stay in youth custody.</p>

<p>National Guard troops arrive</p>
<p>Members of the D.C. National Guard are <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/08/12/trump-dc-police-takeover-control/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template">mobilized</a>, with as many as 800 expected to be part of the operation.</p>
<p>There is confusion over command of the D.C. police. The White House and D.C. leadership each assert that they are in control of the force, even as they emphasize cooperation and shared priorities.</p>
<p>In an online chat with community leaders, Bowser calls Trump’s actions an “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/08/13/dc-national-guard-trump-bowser/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template">authoritarian push</a>.”</p>
<h3 data-component="Heading" data-contentid="KH6KL5RJVNC2XL3SSGT2YTWDUE" data-file="custom-template-components/src/Heading/Heading.js" data-style="stitches">Aug. 13 | Day 3</h3>
<p>Checkpoint draws protests</p>
<p>Dozens of onlookers at a checkpoint in Northwest Washington chant “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/08/14/dc-checkpoint-homeland-security-trump/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template">Go home, fascists</a>” at law enforcement.</p>
<p>Trump says he intends to ask Congress to extend the emergency beyond 30 days. He calls the city “dirty” and says he would put a small amount of money toward fix-ups, including road and median improvements. The White House says its D.C. operation has yielded more than 100 arrests.</p>
<p>Jeanine Pirro, the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, announces that Sean Dunn, who threw a sandwich at law enforcement, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/08/13/subway-sandwich-man-arrested-felony/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template">will face a felony</a> charge of assaulting a police officer.</p>
<h3 data-component="Heading" data-contentid="M4E5HF2C4VC4TMWFLYAFOKROA4" data-file="custom-template-components/src/Heading/Heading.js" data-style="stitches">Aug. 14 | Day 4</h3>
<p>DEA administrator named ‘emergency police commissioner’</p>
<p>After the D.C. police chief <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/08/14/trump-dc-immigration-enforcement-police/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template">rolls out a policy</a> allowing officers to assist in federal immigration enforcement in limited circumstances, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi rescinds it, saying it <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/08/14/trump-dc-immigration-enforcement-police/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template">didn’t go far enough</a>. She says Bowser and the police department must submit to a new governing structure, naming DEA administrator <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/08/14/bondi-police-chief-dc-cole/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template">Terry Cole as “emergency police commissioner.”</a></p>
<p>D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb advises Bowser that the Bondi order is unlawful and that she’s not obligated to follow it.</p>
<h3 data-component="Heading" data-contentid="F66NRUEGSZDTJGFU4HOYHROSGI" data-file="custom-template-components/src/Heading/Heading.js" data-style="stitches">Aug. 15 | Day 5</h3>
<p>D.C. attorney general sues Trump administration</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Ana C. Reyes indicates that the police chief must remain in charge and that Trump probably could enlist officers to help enforce immigration laws.</p>
<p>Federal police expedite the clearing of homeless encampments previously scheduled by the city. Dozens<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/08/29/trump-dc-homeless-encampments-cleared/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template"> are displaced</a>.</p>
<p>Agents wearing face coverings and vests are <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/alexkoma.bsky.social/post/3lwhguqpsb22r?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template">captured on a security camera</a>, lining up in front of a sign hanging in a plaza with the words “NO DEPORTATIONS IN MOUNT PLEASANT.” Some put their thumbs up as they snap a photograph, and then they tear the banner down.</p>
<h3 data-component="Heading" data-contentid="SEOKPAFDYJGJTMW22QZQZSRJLI" data-file="custom-template-components/src/Heading/Heading.js" data-style="stitches">Aug. 16 | Day 6</h3>
<p>Republican governors say they will send National Guard troops</p>
<p>Responding to a Trump administration request, governors of South Carolina, Ohio and West Virginia said they will <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/08/16/west-virginia-national-guard-dc-deployment/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template">send up to 750 National Guard troops</a>, joining the 826 members of the National Guard in D.C. Bowser <a href="https://x.com/MurielBowser/status/1956891644076154962?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template">denounces the deployment</a> on social media, saying, “American soldiers and airmen policing American citizens on American soil is #UnAmerican.”</p>
<p>Delivery drivers are detained by federal agents on D.C. streets and put into immigration detention. In one instance, six agents wearing police vests without clear identification <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/08/17/dc-arrests-violent-takedown-immigration/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template">tackle and detain a man riding a moped</a> in Northwest Washington.</p>
<h3 data-component="Heading" data-contentid="BRRUMWLDVFBOJDEIMTBQ4OOJYA" data-file="custom-template-components/src/Heading/Heading.js" data-style="stitches">Aug. 20 | Day 10</h3>
<p>Poll shows most residents strongly oppose Trump’s actions</p>
<p>About 8 in 10 D.C. residents oppose Trump taking control of D.C. police and federal troops patrolling the streets, according to a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/08/20/dc-poll-trump-crime-police/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template">Washington Post-Schar School poll</a>. Compared with last year, significantly fewer D.C. residents say that they worry about being a victim of carjacking, theft, home burglary or assault.</p>
<p>Vice President JD Vance says the takeover in D.C. could be a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/08/20/vance-miller-dc-takeover/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template">test case for other cities</a>. The White House announces that the operation has yielded more than 550 arrests so far.</p>
<h3 data-component="Heading" data-contentid="GXWRRGWKUFEVHJADMPVS3EPGTQ" data-file="custom-template-components/src/Heading/Heading.js" data-style="stitches">Aug. 21 | Day 11</h3>
<p>Trump thanks officers and National Guard troops with pizza</p>
<p>Trump <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/08/21/trump-dc-federal-takeover/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template">visits hundreds of law enforcement officers</a> and National Guard troops at a U.S. Park Police facility in Southeast. He says he wants to improve the grass in D.C. parks to resemble Augusta National Golf Club in Georgia: “We’re going to be re-grassing all of your parks, all brand-new sprinkler systems, the best that you can buy.”</p>
<h3 data-component="Heading" data-contentid="CDLYXOWTRJAOFBMVGD2WXNM324" data-file="custom-template-components/src/Heading/Heading.js" data-style="stitches">Aug. 22 | Day 12</h3>
<p>Trump seeks $2 billion to support cleanup efforts</p>
<p>Trump announces that he would request funding from Congress to beautify the area within a three-mile radius of the Capitol and White House.</p>
<p>Trump also blasts Bowser<a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115070876988527695?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template"> on Truth Social</a>: “Mayor Muriel Bowser must immediately stop giving false and highly inaccurate crime figures, or bad things will happen, including a complete and total Federal takeover of the City!”</p>

<p>National Guard carrying firearms in D.C.</p>
<p>Members of the National Guard are seen with their <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/08/24/national-guard-dc-weapons-armed/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template">sidearms visible</a> at Union Station. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth had authorized the guard to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/08/22/dc-national-guard-weapons-trump-takeover/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template">carry service-issued weapons</a>, including M4 carbine rifles and M17 pistols. Military officials had previously said troops would not carry firearms but would have them nearby.</p>
<p>Maryland Gov. Wes Moore (D) <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/08/24/trump-baltimore-troops-wes-moore/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template">trades barbs</a> with the president on TV and online, and Trump threatens to send National Guard troops to Baltimore.</p>
<p>There are now more than 2,200 members of the National Guard in the District.</p>
<h3 data-component="Heading" data-contentid="FHFMQH4G35CLBAQQHZJSF34G6Y" data-file="custom-template-components/src/Heading/Heading.js" data-style="stitches">Aug. 25 | Day 15</h3>
<p>Congress investigating D.C. crime data</p>
<p>The House Oversight Committee launches an investigation into <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/08/25/dc-police-crime-data-manipulation-congress-investigation/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template">whether D.C. police manipulated data</a> in an effort to make crime rates appear lower. A <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/08/19/trump-police-dc-takeover-justice-department/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template">similar probe</a> by the Justice Department is underway.</p>
<p>On the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/08/24/dc-schools-trump-police-crackdown/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template">first day of school</a> for D.C. public schools, parents are recruiting volunteers to monitor popular routes — particularly around campuses with large populations of Hispanic children and recent immigrants.</p>
<p>Trump <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/08/25/trump-sign-orders-aimed-ending-cashless-bail-flag-burning/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template">signs executive orders</a> aimed at ending cashless bail across the country and directing his administration to prosecute people who “desecrate” the American flag.</p>
<p>The White House announces that its D.C. operation has yielded more than 1,000 arrests.</p>
<h3 data-component="Heading" data-contentid="DA5AJJF22NAZDMC7TDHSZGSRWM" data-file="custom-template-components/src/Heading/Heading.js" data-style="stitches">Aug. 26 | Day 16</h3>
<p>A call for death penalty for people convicted of murder in D.C.</p>
<p>Trump says that anyone convicted of murder in D.C. should get <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/08/26/trump-death-penalty-washington-dc/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template">the death penalty</a>. D.C. abolished capital punishment in the 1980s, but U.S. attorneys can seek the death penalty for certain crimes.</p>
<p>The president also says he plans to extend federal control over D.C. with help from Congress.</p>
<h3 data-component="Heading" data-contentid="X3UU32FXFVFNJGKEULD57UPH3M" data-file="custom-template-components/src/Heading/Heading.js" data-style="stitches">Aug. 27 | Day 17</h3>
<p>D.C. mayor praises federal surge but mentions ‘break in trust’</p>
<p>Bowser said she believes the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/08/28/federal-police-surge-mayor-bowser-crime-decrease/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template">boosted law enforcement presence is working</a>, lowering homicides, gun crimes and carjackings. However, she also describes a “break in trust” between the police and the community and says that the National Guard troops from other states have not been an efficient use of resources and that she doesn’t want masked ICE agents.</p>
<p>Federal grand jurors decline to indict sandwich thrower Sean Dunn on a felony count of assault on an officer. He is <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/08/28/dc-sandwich-guy-misdemeanor/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template">charged with a misdemeanor</a> instead. The U.S. attorney’s office has <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/08/27/trump-crime-surge-court-cases/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template">failed at least four times </a>this month to persuade grand jurors to indict people accused of assaulting, resisting or impeding federal officers.</p>

<p>D.C. to work with federal law enforcement indefinitely</p>
<p>Bowser issues an executive order that requires local coordination with federal law enforcement “to the maximum extent allowable by law within the District.” The order gives no expiration date.</p>
<p>Trump says he will direct federal law enforcement intervention to combat crime in <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/09/02/trump-chicago-national-guard/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template">Chicago and Baltimore</a>, despite staunch opposition from state and local officials.</p>

<p>Bowser announces 13 percent raise for D.C. police officers</p>
<p>The police department, whose ranks have shrunk to half-century lows, employs 3,188 sworn officers, with many working overtime. Bowser says she hopes to increase staffing to 4,000 officers.</p>
<p>Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D) <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/09/03/bowser-dc-police-raises/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template">speaks out against Trump’s interference</a> and advocates for statehood. “No emergency exists in D.C. that the president did not create himself,” she says.</p>
<p>A group of D.C. Council members meets with House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (New York), seeking to bolster Democratic support for D.C. autonomy on the Hill. Meanwhile, the House GOP <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/09/03/house-gop-weighing-bills-remove-elected-dc-ag-overhaul-justice-policies/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template">weighs a slate of 14 bills</a> that would undermine D.C. autonomy and significantly alter local criminal justice policies.

<p>D.C. attorney general files second lawsuit against Trump</p>
<p>Schwalb’s lawsuit argues that the president has exceeded his authority and that National Guard troops are illegally being used for law enforcement purposes. He describes it as an <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/09/04/dc-national-guard-troops-lawsuit/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template">illegal “military occupation.”</a></p>

<p>Maryland Gov. Moore and Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott (D) announce an <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/09/05/baltimore-trump-national-guard-troops/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template">open-ended increase in public safety efforts</a>. Maryland State Police troopers and officers from the Maryland Transportation Authority will do “proactive enforcement in high-risk areas.” The extra officers also will assist on investigations of firearm and narcotics offenses.</p>

<p>Thousands march in D.C. against law enforcement takeover</p>
<p>People flood 16th Street NW, marching from Meridian Hill Park to Freedom Plaza, in the first major organized protest in the District since Trump’s deployment of federal troops to the nation’s capital.</p>
