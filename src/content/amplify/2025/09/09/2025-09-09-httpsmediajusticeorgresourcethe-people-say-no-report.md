title: 'The People Say No: Resisting Data Centers in the South'
---
<p>Tech giants like Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Meta have spent more than <strong>$100 billion on</strong> <a href="https://fortune.com/2025/08/06/data-center-artificial-intelligence-bubble-consumer-spending-economy/">data center construction</a><strong> just this summer, </strong>and data centers are expected to pass total US consumer spending as the driving force of the US economy this year. Big Tech is marketing these projects as “progress,” but a new report reveals how Southern communities are getting shorted.</p>
<p>MediaJustice is proud to launch <strong>The People Say No: Resisting Data Centers in the South</strong>, our newest groundbreaking report revealing how tech corporations are quietly draining the South – economically and environmentally. This is the <strong>first comprehensive, regional analysis</strong> of data centers in the South, with original research and case studies from <strong>Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee, Georgia, and South Carolina.</strong></p>
<p>Want to learn more? Join our <a href="http://bit.ly/DataCentersSouth">LIVE launch</a> next Wednesday, September 17th at 5:30 PM ET | 2:30 PM PT where we’ll break down our key findings with local organizers across the South.</p>
