<p><strong>Donald Trump</strong> “is the ultimate outsider.” He’s a “bold businessman who asks uncomfortable questions that typical policymakers are too squeamish to ask.” People “may dislike Trump’s methods, but they should appreciate his clarity about power dynamics.” And he has “set a standard in American policymaking of standing up for American workers and consumers.”</p>
<p>Those words aren’t from <strong>Fox News</strong> host <strong>Sean Hannity’s</strong> nightly sycophantic monologue. They come from <strong>Kenneth Weinstein</strong>, who lavished Trump with praise <a href="https://www.hudson.org/foreign-policy/eu-should-cooperate-trump-instead-sitting-out-his-term-kenneth-weinstein?utm_campaign=cbs-conservative-cop&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=www.status.news">in a column</a> published this summer. On Monday, <strong>David Ellison’s Paramount</strong> named Weinstein the new ombudsman of <strong>CBS News</strong>, charged with reviewing complaints about the news division. While Weinstein tried to sanitize his digital footprint by deleting his <strong>X</strong> account, the internet is forever and an online paper trail remains—one that is devoid of any journalism expertise, but reveals a staunch conservative and vocal Trump supporter.</p>
<p>Indeed, Weinstein’s late July column is hardly an isolated example of his pro-<strong>MAGA</strong> history. Federal <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/donor-lookup/results?name=Kenneth+Weinstein&amp;cycle=&amp;state=&amp;zip=&amp;employ=Hudson+Institute&amp;occupation=&amp;jurisdiction=&amp;cand=&amp;type=&amp;utm_campaign=cbs-conservative-cop&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=www.status.news">disclosure records</a> reveal he has donated thousands of dollars to Republican candidates, including Trump, <strong>Marco Rubio</strong>, <strong>Nikki Haley</strong>, and others. Notably, Trump himself tapped Weinstein in 2020 to serve as <strong>U.S. Ambassador to Japan</strong>, though <strong>Congress</strong> never confirmed him. The appointment alone signals that Weinstein is loyal to the president. But, more tellingly, as president of the conservative <strong>Hudson Institute</strong>, Weinstein has spent years championing right-wing causes, lavishing praise on Trump-friendly media figures, and railing against the “liberal media.”</p>
<p>Weinstein’s record includes a stream of alarmist rhetoric popular in right-wing media circles. In February, for example, <a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/17/opinion/what-i-heard-in-munich-germans-want-a-trump-of-their-own/?utm_campaign=cbs-conservative-cop&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=www.status.news">he declared</a> in a <strong>New York Post </strong>column that women in <strong>Europe</strong> "can no longer walk safely at night in cities” because of the influx of <strong>Muslim</strong> migrants. In the same piece, he mocked “media elites” for warning about <strong>NATO’s</strong> future, while deriding the alliance as one that “caters to the interests of progressive elites” and insisting it “needs to undergo a radical shift.”</p>
<p>Weinstein also made his political preferences clear ahead of the 2024 election. Speaking on a panel in October, Weinstein <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=600_ejLadUM&amp;t=883s&amp;utm_campaign=cbs-conservative-cop&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=www.status.news">fiercely advocated</a> for Trump to win reelection. Meanwhile, he declared that he was “concerned about a<strong> [Kamala] Harris</strong> presidency,” describing her prospective administration as “a team that preferred often times to make preemptive concessions to our adversaries rather than to show signs of strength.” The possibility they could be in positions of power, he added, “really worries me.”</p>
<p>Weinstein hasn’t hidden his contempt for the press either. In late 2024, he tweeted: “Could the presence of one righteous man <strong>[Tony Dokoupil]</strong> save [CBS News] from utter condemnation?”—a jab tied to Dokoupil’s contentious interview with author<strong> Ta-Nehisi Coates</strong>. In 2015, the Hudson Institute honored right-wing media mogul <strong>Rupert Murdoch</strong>. During a speech at the event, Weinstein <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lZ45ILkTEw&amp;utm_campaign=cbs-conservative-cop&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=www.status.news">gushed that</a> he was “so pleased” to present the award to the <strong>Fox News </strong>owner, calling Murdoch a “revolutionary” who had “transformed global media”—never mind the toxic waste that Murdoch’s properties have dumped into the public information environment.</p>
<p>Of course, that is only a glimpse of Weinstein’s long record. Cataloguing every instance in which he has praised Trump or assailed the “media elites” would take far more space than this column allows. But the pattern is unmistakable—and Ellison appointed him to the high-profile job surely knowing who he was hiring.</p>
<p>The appointment of a Trump nominee and conservative advocate as CBS News ombudsman directly contradicts Ellison’s repeated insistence last month to reporters that he would not “politicize” the company. Now coupled with his <a href="https://www.status.news/p/bari-weiss-cbs-news-david-ellison">looming deal</a> to acquire <strong>Bari Weiss’ The Free Press</strong> at an absurd valuation, the move makes unmistakably clear that Ellison is steering the one-time home of<strong> Walter Cronkite</strong> and <strong>Edward R. Murrow </strong>into ideological waters that favor Trump.</p>
<p>To be clear, Weinstein will not wield unilateral power. According to Paramount’s outlined structure, if a complaint lands on his desk and he deems it valid, he must escalate it to Paramount President <strong>Jeff Shell </strong>and television division chief <strong>George Cheeks</strong>. Only if they agree would the matter reach CBS News President<strong> Tom Cibrowski</strong>, who would then be tasked with implementing any corrective action.</p>
<p>But while Weinstein may lack absolute authority, his very presence in the chain of command exerts pressure. Cibrowski, Shell, and Cheeks alike will inevitably feel the weight of his decisions and dismissing them will be difficult. And CBS News journalists may begin to self-censor, wary of how their reporting will be judged by an ombudsman with a record of blasting the “liberal media” and praising Trump. Even if Weinstein never formally intervenes in coverage, his appointment creates a chilling effect. Reporters and producers will know that complaints about “bias” will be reviewed through a right-wing lens, one that introduces a partisan distortion which undercuts the ombudsman role’s credibility from the start.</p>
<p>At the very least, Ellison’s appointment of Weinstein and recruitment of Weiss sends a strong signal to CBS News staff, right-wing critics, and the political class in Washington. For those inside the newsroom, it raises serious questions about whether CBS News’ editorial independence can survive under Ellison’s ownership. For those on the outside, it telegraphs a willingness to politicize one of America’s most storied news brands—all despite Ellison’s repeated insistence to the contrary.</p>

<p><strong><em>The Future of Fox:</em></strong> The future of <strong>Rupert Murdoch’s</strong> right-wing media empire and <strong>Fox News</strong> has been cemented. On Monday, the Murdoch family <a href="https://newscorp.com/2025/09/08/news-corp-announces-resolution-of-murdoch-family-trust-matter/?utm_campaign=cbs-conservative-cop&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=www.status.news">announced</a> its long-running and high-stakes succession showdown had come to a close, with Rupert reaching a deal with his children that will hand the reins of his media empire to his eldest son, <strong>Lachlan</strong>. In recent years, the Murdoch heirs have waged a bitter fight over who would inherit Rupert’s media throne and its sweeping political influence, with rival siblings angling to steer the empire in sharply different directions. Under the agreement, siblings <strong>James</strong>, <strong>Elisabeth</strong>, and <strong>Prudence</strong> will relinquish their claims to trust-held stakes in <strong>Fox Corp. </strong>and<strong> News Corp.</strong>, in return for roughly $1.1 billion each—totaling about $3.3 billion—to walk away. But perhaps most critically, the deal secures Fox News’ right-wing posture under Lachlan, who has steered the network ever closer to <strong>Donald Trump’s</strong> far-rightMAGA politics—closing the door on any hope that his more moderate siblings might push the empire in a different direction.</p>

<p><strong><em>Trump’s Epstein Receipts:</em></strong> Earlier this summer, <strong>Donald Trump</strong> dismissed a bombshell report from <strong>Emma Tucker’s The WSJ</strong> that he had gifted <strong>Jeffrey Epstein</strong> a crude birthday doodle, calling it “a fake thing” and suing the<strong> Rupert Murdoch</strong>-owned paper for $10 billion over its reporting. On Monday, The WSJ and others <a href="https://www.wsj.com/us-news/law/epstein-birthday-book-congress-9d79ab34?mod=hp_lead_pos1&amp;utm_campaign=cbs-conservative-cop&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=www.status.news">published the receipts</a> after Epstein’s lawyers handed the sketch over to <strong>Congress</strong>, publicly revealing the very thing Trump swore didn’t exist. The sketch, pulled from Epstein’s 2003 birthday album, shows a nude woman with Trump’s signature standing in as pubic hair alongside a not-so-subtle note. Nevertheless, <strong>White House</strong> press secretary <strong>Karoline Leavitt</strong> (predictably) denied Trump’s involvement: “As I have said all along, it’s very clear President Trump did not draw this picture, and he did not sign it.”</p>

<p><strong><em>Meta Under the Microscope:</em></strong> The <strong>Senate Judiciary Committee</strong> will hold a closely-watched <a href="https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/committee-activity/hearings/hidden-harms-examining-whistleblower-allegations-that-meta-buried-child-safety-research?utm_campaign=cbs-conservative-cop&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=www.status.news">hearing</a> on Tuesday afternoon "examining whistleblower allegations that <strong>Meta</strong> buried child safety research." The bombshell claims were made by two current and two former employees of the <strong>Mark Zuckerberg</strong>-controlled company and published Monday in <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2025/09/08/meta-research-child-safety-virtual-reality/?utm_campaign=cbs-conservative-cop&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=www.status.news">a detailed story</a> in<strong> The WaPo</strong>. The whistleblowers alleged that Meta ordered some research on how children were using its products to be deleted—a claim Meta strongly denied. “The claims at the heart of this hearing are nonsense; they’re based on selectively leaked internal documents that were picked specifically to craft a false narrative," a Meta spokesperson said. "The truth is there was never any blanket prohibition on conducting research with young people and, since the start of 2022, Meta approved nearly 180<strong> Reality Labs</strong>-related studies on issues including youth safety and well-being.” We'll see how that statement holds up in the hearing Tuesday, which will feature two of the former Meta researchers.</p>

Meta dismissed the claims as simply coming from "a former employee" that was "dismissed for poor performance."</p>
