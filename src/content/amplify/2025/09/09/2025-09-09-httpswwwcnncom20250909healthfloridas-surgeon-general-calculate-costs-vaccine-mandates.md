            Florida’s surgeon general said Sunday that he had not weighed the cost – in terms of infections, hospitalizations or deaths – of ending vaccine mandates in his state. But scientists who have done those calculations say those costs may be high.

            Asked by CNN’s Jake Tapper whether he had done any data analysis or projections of how many new cases of vaccine-preventable disease there would be if the mandates were lifted for everyone in Florida, including schoolchildren, as he proposed last week, Dr. Joseph Ladapo answered, “Absolutely not.”

            Infectious disease forecasters at Stanford University who <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2833361" target="_blank">recently looked</a> at the effects of falling vaccination rates across the country found that in Florida alone, a 15% decline in vaccinations against measles over 25 years would lead to 1 million measles cases.

            The state is particularly vulnerable because of its large population and brisk tourism industry, according to lead study author Dr. Mathew Kiang. Disney World in Orlando has often been the site of measles cases imported from other countries, for example.

            “Unvaccinated groups in the United States are sort of like tinder, and vaccines are sort of fire protection, and so every imported case is like throwing a match into the fire,” said Kiang, an assistant professor in the Department of Epidemiology and Population Health<strong>.</strong> “For most of them, nothing is going to happen, but what you don’t want is a situation where one happens and then it comes roaring back like a wildfire.”

            For every 1,000 measles cases, there are between 1 and 3 deaths from breathing complications or brain swelling. If there are a million cases, that’s about 1,000 deaths that doctors consider preventable with the use of vaccines.

            “I think what our study has illustrated is that the US is really on the tipping point for measles reemergence,” said senior study author Dr. Nathan Lo, an infectious disease specialist at Stanford. “Even small declines like five or ten percent should really put us on that path.”

            Another analysis, modeled by researchers at the University of Florida’s Center for Statistics and Quantitative Infectious Diseases last week after Ladapo’s announcement, suggests that even a small drop in measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine coverage among kindergartners in Florida – from the current rate of about 89% down to 85% – could raise the risk of measles spread and the size of outbreaks in the state. <strong></strong>
</p>
<p data-article-gutter="true" data-component-name="paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfbm3ytt000d2e6ee9m6vswa@published">
            The likelihood of an infected child spreading the disease would rise from 85.5% to nearly 93%, the analysis found, and the average outbreak in a school of 200 students would rise from 20 to 32 students.

            “We wanted to show the potential impact of further decrease in vaccine coverage in the schools and beyond, and we picked the most transmissible infection, measles, as an illustration. Of course, the transmission of other infectious diseases would increase as well,” said Dr. Ira Longini, an author of the analysis and professor of biostatistics at the University of Florida.

            Vaccination rates have been falling nationwide as more states allow parents to opt out of school mandates for religious or philosophical reasons and vaccine skepticism rises, fueled by rampant misinformation on social media.

            In many areas, vaccination rates have fallen below the 95% threshold in kindergarteners needed to create herd immunity against measles. Because measles is so contagious, it takes high levels of vaccination to keep it from spreading in the population.

            Thanks to vaccines, the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html" target="_blank">US eliminated measles</a> as a regularly transmitting disease in 2000, but at current levels of vaccination, it will entrench itself again within 20 years, the Stanford study found. Boosting vaccination, on the other hand, would prevent it from becoming a regularly occurring infection again. <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2833361" target="_blank">The study</a> was published in April in the medical journal JAMA.

            If childhood vaccinations in the US drop by half, the study predicted 51.2 million cases of measles over 25 years, 9.9 million cases of rubella, 4.3 million cases of polio and 200 cases of diphtheria. That would result in an estimated 51,200 cases of brain damage from measles, 5,400 cases of post-polio paralysis, 10.3 million hospitalizations and an average of 159,200 deaths.

            “We’re not taking vaccines away from anyone,” he told Tapper. “What we said was that if you want them, God bless you, you can have as many as you want, and if you don’t want them, parents should have the ability and the power to decide what goes into their children’s bodies.”

            The Community Preventive Services Task Force was established by the US Department of Health and Human Services three decades ago to develop evidence-based guidance on public health interventions. In 2016, the group assessed findings from two dozen studies on the effects of state or local vaccination requirements, most of which were conducted in the US and focused on vaccine requirements to attend school.

            They found that vaccine mandates were associated with an 18 percentage point increase in vaccination rates, on average. And the collection of studies showed that vaccine requirements reduced the incidence of measles, mumps, influenza and hepatitis. One study from Japan found that children were more likely to die from influenza and pneumonia after national influenza vaccine mandates were removed.

            Up to 8% of infected people have been hospitalized, he said, a brutal toll in a developed country. An infected infant died.

            “I think most in the general public and in the health care and public health communities would feel that this was a very large outbreak and unacceptable,”<strong> </strong>Bogoch said. “It’s an unfortunate sign of perhaps shifting attitudes towards public health measures that have really kept children and the population safe for decades.”

            Vaccination rates are falling in Canada, just as they have in the US and many other countries. That was partly due to the disruption in routine medical care during the Covid-19 pandemic and partly due to rising distrust in vaccines, Bogoch said.

            “The rhetoric and the dismantling of institutions or policies that promote vaccination will have a predictable effect,” he said. “And we’re seeing the results of that right now.”
