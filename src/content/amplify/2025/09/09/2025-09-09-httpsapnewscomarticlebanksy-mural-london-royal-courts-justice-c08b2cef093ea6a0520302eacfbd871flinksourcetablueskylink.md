  New Banksy mural of a judge beating a protester to be removed from outside
  London court
---
<p>LONDON (AP) — A new mural by elusive street artist <a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/banksy">Banksy</a> showing a judge beating an unarmed protester with a gavel will be removed from a wall outside one of London’s most iconic courts, authorities said Monday.</p>
<p>The mural appeared Monday and depicts a protester lying on the ground holding a blood-splattered placard while a judge in a traditional wig and black gown beats him with a gavel. Banksy posted a photo of the work on Instagram, his usual method of claiming a work as authentic. It was captioned “Royal Courts Of Justice. London.”</p>
<p>Security officials outside the courthouse covered the artwork Monday with sheets of black plastic and two metal barriers, and it was being guarded by two officers and a security camera.</p>
<p>Because the Victorian gothic revival style building is 143 years old, the mural will be removed with consideration for its historical significance, according to HM Courts and Tribunals.</p>
<p>“The Royal Courts of Justice is a listed building and HMCTS are obliged to maintain its original character,” it said in a statement. Listed buildings are considered the country’s most significant historic buildings and sites and are protected by law.</p>
<p>While the artwork doesn’t refer to a particular cause or incident, activists saw it as a reference to the U.K. government’s <a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/palestine-action-protest-israeli-hostages-cad78ce82f9e8e7627f2c842cc5157a8">ban on the group Palestine Action</a>. On Saturday <a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/britain-palestine-action-protest-arrests-b6acca3f6e46cf0fd64ae11d413f5bd8">almost 900 people were arrested</a> at a London protest challenging the ban.</p>

<p>Defend Our Juries, the group that organized the protest, said in a statement that the mural “powerfully depicts the brutality unleashed” by the government ban.</p>
<p>“When the law is used as a tool to crush civil liberties, it does not extinguish dissent, it strengthens it,” the statement said.</p>
<p>The courts have weighed in on the Palestine Action case, with judges initially rejecting the organization’s request to appeal its ban. A High Court court judge then allowed the appeal to go forward, though the government is now challenging that decision.</p>
<p>Banksy began his career spray-painting buildings in Bristol, England, and has become one of the world’s best-known artists. His paintings and installations <a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/business-lifestyle-london-banksy-arts-and-entertainment-2afc1f803d58f96dc21e485e40d785f0">sell for millions of dollars at auction</a> and have drawn <a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/banksy-stop-sign-drones-london-5c4e3bcbac02fe89f9295ea2d66d58c6">thieves</a> and <a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/london-banksy-mural-vandalism-fencing-252b346a0ce49be8a5a7ccfc2c50f027">vandals</a>.</p>

<p>At the Glastonbury Festival last year, an inflatable raft holding dummies of migrants in life jackets was unveiled during a band’s headline set. Banksy appeared to claim the stunt, which was thought to symbolize small boat crossings of migrants in the English Channel, in a post on Instagram.</p>
<p>The artist has also taken his message on migration to Europe.</p>
<p>In 2019, <a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/banksy-restoration-venice-migrant-child-d8a6a158d2aba14c8f6b139d5a2b6dfd">“The Migrant Child,”</a> depicting a shipwrecked child holding a pink smoke bomb and wearing a life jacket, was unveiled in Venice, Italy. In 2018, a number of works including one near a former center for migrants that depicted a child spray-painting wallpaper over a swastika were discovered in Paris.</p>
<p>Banksy has also created numerous artworks in the West Bank and Gaza Strip over the years, including one depicting a girl conducting a body search on an Israeli soldier, another showing a dove wearing a flak jacket, and a masked protester hurling a bouquet of flowers. He designed <a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/b19763edb0a44037adb0cafcc3e0b223">the “Walled Off Hotel” guesthouse</a> in Bethlehem, which closed in October 2023.</p>
<p>Last summer, Banksy captured London’s attention with an <a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/banksy-london-zoo-animals-escape-mural-art-870717fa5e2328245758a59288f23c37">animal-themed collection,</a> which concluded with a mural of a gorilla appearing to hold up the entrance gate to London Zoo.</p>
<p>For nine days straight, Banksy-created creatures — from a mountain goat perched on a building buttress to piranhas circling a police guard post to a rhinoceros mounting a car — showed up in unlikely locations around the city.</p>
