  Opinion | Early decision college admissions should be eliminated - The
  Washington Post

<p>Schools should admit students on merit — not the willingness to commit early.</p>
<p>College admissions in the United States have become divorced from merit. I’m not referring to contentious arguments over legacy admissions, affirmative action or athletic recruitment. I’m talking about early decision.</p>
<p>Under early-decision admissions, an option that many private colleges and universities offer, students apply to one school — and one school only — by an early deadline and then must attend if accepted. In that respect, early decision differs from other application routes: It is binding. If you back out, there can be <a href="https://www.collegeraptor.com/getting-in/articles/questions-answers/happens-back-early-decision/">serious consequences</a> that limit your ability to attend other schools and damage your high school’s relationship with the college and you. And therein lies the anti-meritocratic rub.</p>
