<p>Some of New York City’s richest landlords are done sitting on the sidelines of the city’s mayor’s race.</p>
<p>On Tuesday morning, at roughly the same time that President Trump was opining on the radio about Mayor Eric Adams’s bottom-of-the-barrel poll numbers, a group of real estate leaders and businesspeople gathered at the Pool Room, an exclusive event space in the Seagram Building in Midtown Manhattan, to meet with former Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and help plot his path to City Hall.</p>
<p>The event took place less than 14 hours after Jeff Blau, arguably Manhattan’s biggest developer, and his wife, Lisa Blau, an investor, sent an email blast to members of their exclusive circle, saying that if they did not take immediate action to support Mr. Cuomo, the election in November would assuredly be won by Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani.</p>
<p>“Sorry for the late notice, but there is no more time for delay, discussion or dithering — we must act decisively to ensure that the next mayor of New York is Andrew Cuomo,” read the note. “The only viable candidate with the experience, support and gravitas to defeat Zohran Mamdani is Governor Andrew Cuomo.”</p>
<p>The email, acquired by The New York Times on Monday evening, urged recipients to gather Tuesday at the Pool Room. “We cannot afford hesitation,” it read. “Every one of us must get involved immediately.”</p>
<p>In addition to the Blaus, the invitation was signed by a co-owner of the Seagram Building, Aby Rosen; the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/laurie-tisch/">billionaire philanthropist Laurie M. Tisch</a>; and the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/gregg-hymowitz/#:~:text=Hymowitz%20is%20chairman%20and%20CEO,B%20in%20assets%20under%20management.">hedge fund billionaire Gregg Hymowitz</a>, among others.</p>
<p>Mr. Hymowitz, Mr. Rosen and a spokeswoman for Ms. Tisch did not respond to requests for comment. A spokeswoman for the Blaus declined to comment, as did a spokeswoman for Mr. Cuomo.</p>
<p>Shortly before the meeting was to begin on Tuesday morning, guests trickled into the entrance to the Pool Room on 52nd Street, mostly ignoring TV reporters asking them why they were there. Mr. Cuomo largely avoided the news media as he passed through the Seagram Building’s main entrance on Park Avenue.</p>
<p>Mr. Rosen and Ms. Blau spoke at the event, according to an attendee.</p>
<p>Among the guests was Marc Altheim, a founder of Atlantic Development Group, a real estate firm, and the owner of a yoga studio. Mr. Altheim <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/08/nyregion/08cuomo.html">once worked with Mr. Cuomo</a>.</p>
<p>“I’m very concerned that New York City is going to be decimated if the other guy takes office,” Mr. Altheim said. “Eric Adams has got to leave the race.”</p>
<p>The meeting came at a potentially pivotal moment in this year’s chaotic race for mayor as it enters its final eight weeks. Months after Mr. Mamdani, a democratic socialist and state assemblyman from Queens, inspired panic among Wall Street and real estate leaders by trouncing Mr. Cuomo in the Democratic primary for mayor, the general election remains unsettled. Moneyed interests had been sitting restlessly on the sidelines as they waited for the field to consolidate behind a formidable challenger to Mr. Mamdani.</p>
<p>In recent days, the race appears to have shifted slightly in that direction. Jim Walden, a prominent lawyer who had mounted an independent campaign for mayor, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/02/nyregion/jim-walden-mayor-campaign.html">said he was dropping out</a> and urged his rivals to unite against Mr. Mamdani.</p>
<p>Mr. Adams, who like Mr. Cuomo is running as an independent, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/04/nyregion/adams-trump-job-quits.html">privately told allies</a> that he was seriously considering jobs that could prompt him to suspend his re-election campaign, and he met last week in Florida with Steve Witkoff, an adviser to Mr. Trump. Mr. Witkoff, in turn, had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/05/nyregion/eric-adams-saudi-arabia-ambassador.html">been helping craft a plan</a> to get the president to nominate Mr. Adams as ambassador to Saudi Arabia. That plan appears to have at least temporarily lost steam.</p>
<p>In a hastily arranged Friday afternoon news conference, Mr. Adams insisted he was not going anywhere.</p>
<p>Yet the very next day, Bill Ackman, the billionaire financier who was once so close to Mr. Adams that he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/09/nyregion/eric-adams-eugene-noh-bill-ackman.html">helped vet the mayor’s campaign manager,</a> urged Mr. Adams to step aside.</p>
<p>“I strongly believe that what is best for NYC — Eric stepping aside — is also what is best for Eric Adams,” Mr. Ackman <a href="https://x.com/BillAckman/status/1964368044588724465">wrote on social media.</a> “Eric should know that good will is a very valuable asset and the alternative is a very costly liability.”</p>
<p>Mr. Trump appears to agree.</p>
<p>On Tuesday morning, the same day <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/09/nyregion/mayor-poll-mamdani-cuomo.html">The Times and Siena University</a> released poll numbers showing Mr. Mamdani with a formidable lead (and Mr. Adams at 9 percent), an interview with the president aired on the conservative talk radio host Sid Rosenberg’s morning show.</p>
<p>“The mayor is polling badly,” Mr. Trump said, before noting his role in having the Justice Department abandon Mr. Adams’s federal corruption indictment. “Now, if you had two people drop out, could somebody win? The answer is maybe, but even that’s going to be a little bit of a long shot, I guess, based on the polls.”</p>
<p>Advisers to the president have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/03/nyregion/trump-adams-sliwa-quit-nyc-mayor.html">also discussed</a> finding a job for Curtis Sliwa, the Republican candidate and founder of the Guardian Angels, something Mr. Sliwa has said he will not consider.</p>
<p>These developments appear to have inspired hope among business leaders that consolidation in the mayoral field might soon be at hand.</p>
<p>“The time to act is now,” read the email. “If we fail to mobilize, the financial capital of the world risks being handed over to a socialist this November. We cannot — and will not — let that happen.”</p>
<p>In a statement, a spokeswoman for Mr. Mamdani suggested that the business leaders’ behind-the-scenes maneuvering reflected poorly on Mr. Cuomo, their chosen candidate.</p>
<p>“While billionaires continue to panic and scheme behind closed doors, our campaign is mobilizing tens of thousands of New Yorkers to get involved in the democratic process and rally around an agenda to make this city affordable,” Dora Pekec, a spokeswoman for the Mamdani campaign, said in a statement. “That contrast should tell you everything you need to know about this race.”</p>
