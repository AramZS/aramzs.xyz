It already places users aged 13 to 18 into "teen accounts" on Facebook, Instagram and Messenger, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cvgqe6yv0yzo" target="_self">with content and privacy settings which aim to give them a safer experience</a>.</p><p>It told the BBC in April these would also allow parents and guardians to see which AI chatbots their teen had spoken to in the last seven days.</p></div><p data-component="subheadline-block"><h2>Safety concerns</h2></p><div data-component="text-block"><p>The changes come amid concerns over the potential for AI chatbots <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c24zdel5j18o" target="_self">to mislead young or vulnerable users</a>.</p><p>A California couple recently sued ChatGPT-maker OpenAI over the death of their teenage son, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cgerwp7rdlvo" target="_self">alleging its chatbot encouraged him to take his own life</a>.</p><p>The lawsuit came after the company announced changes to promote healthier ChatGPT use last month.</p><p>"AI can feel more responsive and personal than prior technologies, especially for vulnerable individuals experiencing mental or emotional distress," the firm said <a href="https://openai.com/index/how-we're-optimizing-chatgpt/" target="_blank">in a blog post</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/meta-created-flirty-chatbots-taylor-swift-other-celebrities-without-permission-2025-08-29/" target="_blank">reported on Friday</a> Meta's AI tools allowing users to create chatbots had been used by some - including a Meta employee - to produce flirtatious "parody" chatbots of female celebrities.</p><p>Among celebrity chatbots seen by the news agency were some using the likeness of artist Taylor Swift and actress Scarlett Johansson.</p><p>Reuters said the avatars "often insisted they were the real actors and artists" and "routinely made sexual advances" during its weeks of testing them.</p><p>It said Meta's tools also permitted the creation of chatbots impersonating child celebrities and, in one case, generated a photorealistic, shirtless image of one young male star.</p><p>Several of the chatbots in question were later removed by Meta, it reported.</p><p>"Like others, we permit the generation of images containing public figures, but our policies are intended to prohibit nude, intimate or sexually suggestive imagery," a Meta spokesperson said.</p><p>They added that its AI Studio rules forbid "direct impersonation of public figures".</p></div><figure></figure></article></div>
