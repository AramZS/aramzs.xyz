  'Vibe coding' lets anyone spin up an app in plain English. But recent security
  incidents suggest speed may be outpacing security as investors pour billions
  into the trend.

<p>Vibe coding soared to prominence on the premise that a person with just an idea and no software skills could create new applications using instructions in plain English. But a growing number of hacks and security vulnerabilities is raising concerns about these tools.</p>
<p><a data-cms-ai="0" href="https://pitchbook.com/profiles/company/494069-14"><u>Tea</u></a>, an app for women to confidentially share dating experiences built in part with vibe coding software, suffered a data breach last month that exposed more than 130,000 user photos and identifying information. <a data-cms-ai="0" href="https://pitchbook.com/profiles/company/113831-02">Replit</a>, a popular such tool that emphasizes security and transparency, was <a data-cms-ai="0" href="https://www.cpomagazine.com/cyber-security/replit-ai-meltdown-trashes-vibe-coding-project-amid-data-wipe-fake-accounts-and-lies/?utm_source=chatgpt.com#google_vignette"><u>accused</u></a> this summer of leaving glaring security gaps in a customer’s project and then trying to cover its tracks with fake logs and hallucinated safety checks.</p>
<p>Still, VCs continue pouring capital into these tools at an exponential rate.</p>
<p>Swedish vibe coding startup <a data-cms-ai="0" href="https://pitchbook.com/profiles/company/600908-32"><u>Loveable</u></a> is <a data-cms-ai="0" href="https://www.ft.com/content/a97dd70c-e6ba-41b1-909d-90436a41d5f2"><u>reportedly</u></a> evaluating fresh investment offers at a $4 billion valuation, more than <a data-cms-ai="0" href="https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/vibe-coding-startup-lovable-becomes-swedens-newest-unicorn-with-200m-raise">double its last valuation</a>. Cursor-maker Anysphere has been <a data-cms-ai="0" href="https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/anysphere-cursor-ai-coding-doubling-valuation-every-8-weeks"><u>doubling its valuation at an incomparable pace</u></a> of every eight weeks. And <a data-cms-ai="0" href="https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/gpt-5s-vibe-coding-saves-the-day-in-underwhelming-openai-launch"><u>vibe coding emerged as the highlight of OpenAI’s recent unveiling</u></a> of its newest LLM, GPT-5.</p>
<p>“It helps you get past that first step in app creation, without having to have that technical co-founder or that initial technical team … [But] you get yourself into trouble when you’re using a vibe-coded application with sensitive data with lots of users,” said Aziz Gilani, a general partner at Mercury.</p>
<h3>The 10:1 ratio of shipping vs. security</h3>
<p>These tools are enabling early-stage startups to ship apps faster than ever, but security is taking a backseat to the breakneck shipping pace, according to Jeremy Kranz, <a data-cms-ai="0" href="https://pitchbook.com/profiles/investor/501580-00">Sentinel Global</a>’s managing partner. Pre-seed and seed startups often can’t afford to hire credentialed engineers to mind the security gaps.</p>
<p>For every $10 spent on getting a vibe-coped application to market, less than $1 is spent on security, estimates Kranz.</p>
<p>“That 10:1 ratio is a problem, because you’re deploying and proliferating almost in a panic,” said Kranz, who previously spent 17 years at <a data-cms-ai="0" href="https://pitchbook.com/profiles/limited-partner/12421-90">GIC</a>.</p>
<p>Even when the makers of these tools become aware of security vulnerabilities, they may not always move quickly to fix them. A Loveable competitor in June claimed that the Swedish startup had been aware for several months of an open lane for hackers, yet did not immediately take care of it.</p>
<p>Veteran VCs liken this moment to the early days of the Internet. The emergence of OpenAI and the fast-growing data centers, like CoreWeave, that supply GPUs is the rough equivalent of the rise of broadband, they say.</p>
<p>“In the early 2000s, when AWS is first launching, it was this huge unlock for startups, because we had these cloud computing platforms that people could actually use … it saves us the step of having to build up entire [internal servers] to maintain all this in-house infrastructure,” Gilani said. “Vibe-coded applications are an amazing way to test out an initial idea, an amazing way to show a user—to gauge their interest level. But, man, you still gotta test the thing, you still have to scale the thing, you still have to make sure that data is secure.”</p>
<p>Technological innovation requires risk, and new tech is never going to be the safest tech for users, according to Michael Collins, CEO of Alumni Ventures. That’s true even going back to the advent of the personal computer.</p>
<p>“It’s like, we couldn’t trust individuals with this huge security risk of giving everyone a personal computer,” Collins said. “There’s definitely some of that with [vibe coding]. But it’s like, this is a new ... damn important technology ... it’s going to change society in ways you can’t even predict.”</p>
