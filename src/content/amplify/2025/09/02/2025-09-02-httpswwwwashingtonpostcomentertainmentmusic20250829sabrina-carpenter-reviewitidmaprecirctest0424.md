<p>“Man’s Best Friend” is a pop album that feels as zesty, clever and cathartic as stand-up comedy.</p>
<p>We’ve always lived in a world filled with funny pop songs, but funny pop singers are much harder to come by. Maybe that’s because going for laughs and <i>being taken seriously as an artist</i> don’t often square in our cultural imagination, and maybe that’s why Sabrina Carpenter seems to be inventing a new kind of stardom right now.</p>
