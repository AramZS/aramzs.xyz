  Trump administration use of National Guard in L.A. violated law, judge rules -

<p>The ruling in the case brought by California Gov. Gavin Newson (D) determined that the federal government violated the Posse Comitatus Act, which forbids members of the military from enforcing civilian laws.</p>
<p>The Trump administration violated federal law with its use of National Guard troops in Los Angeles, a federal judge ruled Tuesday.</p>
<p>The judge in the case, which was brought by California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D), concluded that National Guard troops carried out domestic law enforcement actions, violating the federal Posse Comitatus Act.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Charles R. Breyer of the Northern District of California said in a <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.450934/gov.uscourts.cand.450934.176.0_1.pdf">52-page opinion</a> that his order was “narrowly tailored,” writing that the administration was not required to pull back the 300 troops still stationed in Los Angeles. But he blocked them from certain actions and stayed his ruling until next week.</p>
<p>President Donald Trump sent thousands of troops to Los Angeles earlier this summer amid protests over his administration’s immigration actions, sparking immediate legal challenges and criticism.</p>
<p>Breyer also said his order was limited to California and did not apply to National Guard troops in other states. Trump has threatened to send troops to other cities, including <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/09/02/trump-chicago-national-guard/">Chicago</a>.</p>
