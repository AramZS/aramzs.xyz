  Gen Z is pushing back on smart glasses recording strangers in public - The

<p>The people leading the rebellion against camera-enabled glasses in public are the same ones who grew up sharing everything online.</p>
<p>As camera-enabled glasses become more common in public places, young people are pushing back on what many see as a frightening invasion of privacy.</p>
<p>On TikTok, a young woman shared a <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@niessaxoxo_/video/7538155695066074398">video</a> earlier this month saying she went to a European Wax Center in Manhattan for a Brazilian wax, only to find her aesthetician wearing <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/09/09/facebook-ray-ban-stories-smart-glasses-review/">Meta Ray-Bans </a>equipped with a camera. The batteries weren’t charged, the aesthetician claimed. But the experience rattled her. (A European Wax Center spokeswoman said the glasses were powered off at the time of service.)</p>
