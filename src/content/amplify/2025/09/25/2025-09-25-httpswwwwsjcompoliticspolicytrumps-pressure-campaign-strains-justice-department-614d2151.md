<p>WASHINGTON—When Attorney General Pam Bondi swore in a new U.S. attorney for eastern Virginia on Monday, it wasn’t a routine act by the nation’s top law-enforcement official.</p>
<div>It marked instead the latest step in an escalating pressure campaign by President Trump to more aggressively target his political enemies. His   <a data-type="link" href="https://www.wsj.com/us-news/law/trump-pushes-attorney-general-pam-bondi-to-prosecute-political-foes-d14fd92c?mod=article_inline">demand that Bondi prosecute his adversaries</a> has put her in a bind and alarmed some current and former Justice Department officials who say it threatens the institution’s credibility in ways that will be difficult to repair. </div><p></p>
<div>Trump on Friday   <a data-type="link" href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trump-calls-for-dismissal-of-prosecutor-handling-probe-of-his-adversaries-ec269d20?mod=article_inline">ousted the leader</a> of the Virginia office, Erik Siebert, a veteran prosecutor with conservative credentials who had Bondi’s support but who hadn’t been able to muster a case against New York Attorney General Letitia James on allegations of mortgage fraud, which she denies. The president on Saturday then picked one of his former personal lawyers to take Siebert’s place: Lindsey Halligan. She has spent much of her career as an insurance lawyer, and this year was selected as a White House aide to oversee a   <a data-type="link" href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/white-house-to-vet-smithsonian-museums-to-fit-trumps-historical-vision-78875c8a?mod=article_inline">review of Smithsonian exhibitions</a> to ensure they align with Trump’s interpretation of American history. </div><p></p>
<div>Bondi hasn’t spoken publicly on the issue since Trump in a series of weekend comments questioned her lack of action in charging   <a data-type="link" href="https://www.wsj.com/us-news/law/donald-trump-and-letitia-james-raise-stakes-in-bitter-feud-51315ef5?mod=article_inline">top adversaries, including James</a> and former Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey. She swore in Halligan at the Justice Department’s headquarters, and the new lieutenant spent the afternoon scrambling for computer access so she could communicate with the office she now runs. </div><p></p>
<p>Lawyers who work in the Virginia outpost, known for handling high-profile national-security cases, privately expressed uncertainty Monday about their jobs and concern that the office could be forced to rush out an ill-founded case. Some sought advice from former colleagues, and were told to secure insurance against legal malpractice claims.</p>
<p>The clock is ticking loudest on an investigation into Comey. After Trump took office for the second time, the department began investigating whether Comey lied during 2020 congressional testimony concerning the bureau’s earlier investigation of Trump’s connections to Russian interference in the 2016 election. The five-year statute of limitations for any case is set to expire soon, and Siebert had told colleagues that he didn’t see a case to bring, people familiar with the matter said.</p>

<p>In a social-media message Saturday addressed to Bondi, Trump said delays in bringing cases against James, Comey and Sen. Adam Schiff (D., Calif.)—a longtime Trump antagonist—were “killing our reputation and credibility.”</p>
<p>He later told reporters, “I just want people to act. They have to act. And we want to act fast.”</p>
<p>Peter Keisler, who served as acting attorney general under former President George W. Bush, said Trump was “making clear to the entire Justice Department workforce that anybody who does their job and resists this kind of demand is at risk of being fired. That’s toxic to the running of a fair criminal-justice system.”</p>
<p>Beyond the prosecutions Trump is pushing for, his unabashed pressure campaign could undermine confidence that other investigations are being pursued for legitimate reasons, Keisler said.</p>
<p>Even if he is a norm-busting president, Trump’s public instructions to Bondi represented a breach of rules that established the Justice Department’s independence after the Watergate scandal roiled the agency.</p>
<p>In the 1973 Saturday Night Massacre, Attorney General Elliot Richardson and his deputy resigned when President Richard Nixon ordered them to fire the Watergate independent counsel, whose job they had pledged to protect against political interference.</p>
<p>Over the years that followed, department officials codified a series of rules that aimed to restore trust in the institution, in part by limiting contacts between the White House and the Justice Department about the agency’s investigations.</p>
<p>Trump’s maneuvering shows that “all of the guardrails of old are gone,” said Garrett Graff, a historian and author of a recent book about Watergate.</p>

<p>Trump’s supporters see his campaign as tit-for-tat, justified after years of what they perceived as unfair and overzealous investigations into his own conduct. They view the leadership of Bondi and others as rooting out politicization in law enforcement, not injecting it.</p>
<div>After his first term, Trump was hit with four criminal cases, two from Jack Smith, the former special counsel who   <a data-type="link" href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/watchdog-agency-opens-probe-into-jack-smith-who-investigated-trump-af230378?mod=article_inline">brought federal charges against him in 2023</a> and dropped them after Trump was re-elected. </div><p></p>
<div>When James, a Democrat, campaigned for New York attorney general in 2018, she made Trump her central foil, pledging to “be a real pain in the ass” if elected. She delivered on her promise, filing about 100 lawsuits against the Trump administration. After Trump left office, James   <a data-type="link" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-york-attorney-general-sues-trump-his-company-on-fraud-allegations-11663774576?mod=article_inline">sued him for civil fraud</a>, alleging he and his company falsely valued their assets for financial gain. A judge found Trump liable, but an appeals court recently tossed out a more than $500 million penalty. </div><p></p>
<p>Comey was FBI director when the bureau opened its Russia investigation, which spawned special counsel Robert Mueller’s probe that dogged his first presidency. Trump fired Comey months into his first term. Mueller found there was insufficient evidence to establish Trump or his associates engaged in a criminal conspiracy with Russia to disrupt the 2016 election but detailed several contacts between the campaign and Russians.</p>
<p>White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Monday said Trump “is rightfully frustrated. He wants accountability for these corrupt fraudsters who abuse their power, who abused their oath of office to target the former president and then candidate for the highest office in the land.”</p>
<p>Representatives of Comey and James didn’t respond to requests for comment.</p>
<p>Justice Department veterans from Trump’s first term say the current dynamics are different from what they experienced, when officials largely resisted the president’s most extreme demands or were able to at least temporarily placate him.</p>
<div>Attorney General Jeff Sessions in 2018 urged the White House not to fire his deputy, Rod Rosenstein, who oversaw Mueller, and Trump never did. Attorney General William Barr   <a data-type="link" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/attorney-general-william-barr-resigns-effective-dec-23-11607986828?mod=article_inline">refused to pursue</a> Trump’s baseless claims of voter fraud in 2020. A group of senior department officials threatened to resign en masse should Trump fire then-acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen, who replaced Barr when he resigned. </div><p></p>
<p>“Leadership had a lot of experience and a shared understanding of the proper role of federal prosecutors and the department,” said Sarah Isgur, who served as a Justice Department spokeswoman in Trump’s first term.</p>
