<p>For several decades, Cass Sunstein has been one of the most prominent and prolific legal scholars in the United States. A onetime faculty member at the University of Chicago Law School, Sunstein co-authored, with Richard Thaler, the 2008 book “<a data-aps-asc-tag="" data-aps-asin="014311526X" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.amazon.com/Nudge-Improving-Decisions-Health-Happiness/dp/014311526X"}' data-offer-url="https://www.amazon.com/Nudge-Improving-Decisions-Health-Happiness/dp/014311526X" href="https://www.amazon.com/Nudge-Improving-Decisions-Health-Happiness/dp/014311526X">Nudge</a>,” which advocated for government policies that pushed citizens to make certain decisions without restricting their choices. (One example: Asking people who are getting their driver’s licenses whether they would like to be organ donors rather than leaving them to sign up for it on their own.) The next year, Sunstein joined the Obama Administration. He ran the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, which essentially made him the government’s chief overseer of federal regulations. (Sunstein, a friend of Obama from their time in Chicago, was initially the subject of right-wing conspiracy theories that painted him as an overzealous nanny-state enforcer, but he ended up disappointing progressives who thought he was too deferential to the free market.)</p>
<p>Sunstein has written a new book, called “<a data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/790349/on-liberalism-by-cass-r-sunstein/"}' data-offer-url="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/790349/on-liberalism-by-cass-r-sunstein/" href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/790349/on-liberalism-by-cass-r-sunstein/">On Liberalism</a>,” which is a defense of the idea of liberalism at a time when Sunstein believes it is under threat from both the right and the left. The book barely mentions Donald Trump or contemporary politics, however, and instead provides a defense of a general liberal belief system, which Sunstein breaks down into eighty-five features. Sunstein’s conception of liberalism is quite capacious; it includes New Deal liberals and so-called classical liberals, including Friedrich von Hayek and Robert Nozick, as well as politicians such as Ronald Reagan.</p>
<p>I recently spoke with Sunstein, currently a professor at Harvard Law School, about the book and our current political moment. During our conversation, which has been edited for length and clarity, we discussed how to understand the origins of the conservative movement, his confidence that the Supreme Court is committed to liberal ideals, and his friendship with a man whom many liberals consider a war criminal: Henry Kissinger.</p>
<p><strong>You have chosen to write a book about liberalism at a time when liberalism is under threat without really talking about what those threats are. It’s more of a positive case for liberalism. Why did you decide to write this particular book?</strong></p>
<p>Partly it’s temperamental. Probably that’s the fundamental answer. To say that there are these people and they have names and they are doing and saying awful things would be, for me, unpleasant.</p>
<p><strong>Even if it’s the President?</strong></p>
<p>Even in the event that it’s the President, that’s right. I feel a little bit that it would date the book and cheapen the analysis if it was calling out the President or calling out some contemporary prominent person. But I think the more fundamental and more truthful answer is that talking about the President makes me grumpy and talking about John Stuart Mill or John Rawls makes me the opposite of grumpy.</p>
<p><strong>Liberalism refers to many things. What liberalism are you talking about in the book?</strong></p>
<p>This is not liberalism of the left, and not liberalism of the neoliberal sort associated with a particular set of right-wing views, but instead a commitment to freedom, pluralism, and the rule of law. That’s the holy trinity of the liberal tradition. Freedom is cashed out most importantly in terms of freedom of speech and freedom of religion, but it also includes private property. Pluralism is on our currency. It also means respect for people who have diverse ethnicities, diverse religious convictions, and diversity in their sense of what kind of life is good.</p>
<p><strong>Even though the book isn’t about liberalism in the sense of modern American political liberals, it did seem that you were both trying to explain why you have some sympathy with that form of liberalism, but also that when it comes to the larger tradition, you have affection and respect for a much broader category of liberals. Is that accurate?</strong></p>
<p>It’s completely correct. I almost called the book “Big-Tent Liberalism,” which means a form of liberalism that includes Ronald Reagan and Barack Obama, and that includes Mill and Robert Nozick, who was a libertarian. It is a wide range of people who intensely disagree with each other. And that is what the book is fundamentally celebrating: the liberal tradition that unites these diverse figures. What surprised me in the writing is that I spent much of my career arguing with right-of-center liberals and being skeptical of some of the views of Hayek or people who I would call overenthusiastic free marketeers. But, doing the book, I came to see them as brothers and sisters. The fundamental values that they speak for are ones I’m honored to share. And, in a time when illiberal and anti-liberal thinking is riding high, to see the free marketeers, the anti-government liberals, as allied in their insistence on freedom, pluralism, and the rule of law is, I think, a step forward.</p>
<p><strong>Yes, you wrote recently, “Once upon a time, I regarded Hayek, Ludwig von Mises, and the Austrians—and also Robert Nozick, Murray Rothbard, and the libertarians—with respect and admiration, but in important ways as adversaries. They were not (I thought) on my team. I no longer think that. I think that they are on my team, or (much better), that I am on their team.” And, of course, you talk about Reagan. One thing I thought you were trying to do was bring the fathers of the modern conservative movement, or the modern conservative movement before 2016, into the tent of liberalism. Is that accurate?</strong></p>
<p>I did an <a data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/20/opinion/cass-sunstein-why-liberal.html"}' data-offer-url="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/20/opinion/cass-sunstein-why-liberal.html" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/20/opinion/cass-sunstein-why-liberal.html">op-ed</a> in the New York <em>Times</em> on liberalism in 2023. And I got a stream of notes from people who are right of center, one of whom is a very distinguished academic who said, “I am a liberal and I’m a conservative. Liberalism is what I want to conserve.”</p>
<p>I worked as a young lawyer in the Reagan Administration. I didn’t vote for Reagan. I served him as best I could, with alarm at some of the things he did and appreciation for others. But, in retrospect, for the Reagan people, at least in the year I worked there, which was the first year, the rule of law was bedrock. So, in the Justice Department, we told the White House that certain things weren’t lawful, and that they couldn’t do them. Instead of fighting, they said, Well, let’s do something else.</p>
<p>I’ve had a love-hate relationship with Hayek, maybe more like love-skepticism, kind of like a romance that isn’t going to work, but now the love is in a big font and the skepticism is in a smaller font. Many people on the left really don’t like him at all. But part of my fondness for Hayek was fuelled by a book he wrote about John Stuart Mill. It’s really a collection of letters between Mill and Harriet Taylor, his wife. Some of these letters are from before they were married. It’s kind of scandalous. And Hayek was really into it. There’s a lot of passion there. That makes me love Hayek. Also, it’s a book about freedom. Why would he do the book? It’s a book about freedom between two people who loved each other.</p>
<p><strong>Hayek talked about disliking “Near Eastern” students because they were “fundamentally dishonest.” He said that he had a “profound dislike for the typical Indian students at the London School of Economics, which I admit are all one type—Bengali moneylender sons.”</strong></p>
<p>I didn’t know about that. Wow. Hayek was a very complicated figure. He wrote a lot. Some of it’s not so good. The Hayek that I admire is the Hayek who was an extremely persistent and repetitive and powerful critic of socialist planning on the ground that it couldn’t be made to work because the socialist planners won’t know enough, even if they’re competent and well motivated. And also the Hayek who would occasionally say that liberty has an economic foundation, but also a moral foundation. And, in a time like ours, Hayek as Mr. Liberty—that’s someone who we want to be in the same club with.</p>
<p><strong>Hayek supported the 1973 coup in Chile. There are lots of things that don’t make him seem like such a democrat or liberal, correct?</strong></p>
<p>The criticisms are either accurate or, in some sense, fair. So when I say Hayek is a great figure or a great part of the liberal tradition, I don’t mean to endorse everything he said.</p>
<p><strong>You mentioned Murray Rothbard as another figure on your team. He was also controversial: he talked positively about David Duke’s 1992 Presidential campaign, and he said that he wanted to replace America’s government with some sort of anarcho-capitalism. Given where our politics are now, it doesn’t seem like a coincidence that so many of these figures were important for the conservative movement. How do you think about that?</strong></p>
<p>Rothbard is not my favorite by any means. Does he belong in the liberal position? Yes. Was he sometimes a crackpot? Yes. But you’re asking a more fundamental question than that, which is about whether there’s continuity between some features of the liberal tradition and some forms of the illiberalism we have now. There’s a sociological connection between some things that anti-liberals say and some things that certain liberals say, and that’s because certain liberals were unfaithful to their liberalism. The liberals who were also racist or sexist or spoke about groups of people in hateful ways were human beings who were insufficiently reflective of what their liberalism entailed. Now, how would we show that that perspective is more accurate than saying that they were naturally illiberal? I think the answer to that is connected to the answer about why I wrote a book that said almost nothing about contemporary illiberalism or contemporary politicians. It’s a character failure on my part.</p>
<p><strong>I was just curious for your explanation regarding how we ended up where we are. I’m not saying that the conservative movement of 1980 or 1994 or 2012 was fated to become what it is today. But I am interested in how you think we ended up here.</strong></p>
<p>When I said “character failure,” I meant it more as a tendency to accentuate the positive, let’s say.</p>
<p>There is a form of right-of-center liberalism that is content with status hierarchies, that is very unhappy with anything that makes people feel reprimanded. Part of the emotional appeal of Reaganism was that there were left-of-center reprimands that seemed like an insult, an effort to inculcate shame, an effort to cast American history in a way that wasn’t sufficiently celebratory. Is this clear?</p>
<p><strong>You are saying political correctness drives people to be more right-wing?</strong></p>
<p>Some version of that. The Reagan-era attack on political correctness is very close, I think less enraged, but very close to the contemporary attack on woke. So woke and political correctness are basically the same thing. And, to answer the question, how did we get here? I think William F. Buckley, Jr., is partly an important figure and also partly diagnostic. His book on Yale, which identified anti-religion and anti-free markets as what Yale was defined by, resonated for the Reagan people and it resonates for the Trump people. If you ask if Buckley’s book is an illiberal book, I think the answer wouldn’t be yes. The emphasis on free markets picks up on a liberal strand and celebrates it. But there was also with Buckley, in terms of race, things that weren’t good at all. He got better over time, but there were things that were horrifying.</p>
<p><strong>And with Reagan, too. When he was <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-49207451">running</a> for governor, he said, “If an individual wants to discriminate against Negroes or others in selling or renting his house, he has a right to do so.” But it seems like you characterize right-wing or anti-democratic thought in America as a response to the modern left. We have a whole history. We had a civil war, segregation. There are all these moments in our history that had anti-liberal movements.</strong></p>
<p>I agree completely. So if the question is whether we attribute the rise of the right to political correctness and wokeness, that would be preposterous. Are they fuel? That’s completely right. If we want to say that America has been an imperfectly liberal country from early on, that’s emphatically true. And by imperfectly liberal the claim is that it shows imperfect fidelity to liberal principles that are shared by many on both the right and the left. And so you could make an argument, today, that the South has risen, and I don’t mean that to say anything particular about Mississippi or Georgia, but to say that some of the thinking associated with the pro-slavery movements hasn’t died.</p>
<p><strong>I remember a <a data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2014-09-22/partyism-now-trumps-racism?embedded-checkout=true"}' data-offer-url="https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2014-09-22/partyism-now-trumps-racism?embedded-checkout=true" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2014-09-22/partyism-now-trumps-racism?embedded-checkout=true">column</a> you wrote in 2014 called “ ‘Partyism’ Now Trumps Racism.” It was about the problem of disliking people or responding to them differently based on the political party they belong to. But we do have a situation now where Trump tried to launch a coup. He failed, but half the country voted for him, and an entire political party is full of almost cultish devotees of him. As someone who has known a lot of Republicans in Washington for a long time and advocated for liberals to be more open-minded toward Republicans in many cases, I’m just curious how you think that through.</strong></p>
<p>What’s going on is, on the one hand, mysterious and, on the other hand, straightforward. What’s straightforward is that, on the part of many Republicans, the thinking is, If we do anything that’s inconsistent with what we see as the Zeitgeist, we’re going to lose our jobs, and we might get shot. It’s very wrong to underestimate the level of fear. Some of the Republicans with whom I worked as recently as 2024 agreed with President Trump on many substantive issues, like cutting taxes, cutting regulation, getting better control of the border. There were many things that they didn’t agree with him on, such as January 6th, and didn’t agree with him with respect to going after political enemies.</p>
<p><strong>Republicans en masse could have voted for someone who wanted to cut taxes and regulations in the 2024 primary. There were a lot of candidates who were pro-life and in favor of low taxes, and Trump still overwhelmingly won the primary.</strong></p>
<p>There is something that’s straightforward, which is fear. My emphasis on freedom from fear in the book was not unrelated to observing people who are not free from fear. There is also the extent to which people behind closed doors will say certain things about the current President but not say those things out loud.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have faith that the current Supreme Court is committed to liberalism?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, I think this current Supreme Court is committed not to leftist liberalism by any means but, basically, to liberalism. They all believe in freedom of speech. They’re all highly committed to freedom of religion. Pluralism is something they embrace. I do think that the Court in general, the Chief Justice in particular, is in a really rare situation with the President of the United States potentially disregarding it. So what the Justices have done recently cannot be fully explained except by reference to a perception on the part of some that we have to tread very cautiously here, because the Court as an institution is more vulnerable than it has been in maybe a hundred years.</p>
<p><strong>But you believe that all nine of the Justices are committed to liberalism of the sort that you outlined in your book and are trying to uphold it?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah. Oh, yeah. I’m not going to name any names, but there is a conservative judge who did read the first couple of chapters of the book and did say, I agree with all of this.</p>
<p><strong>Wow. I would just say that I find it very hard to believe, especially with Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas, who seem to me to be kind of out-and-out partisan Trump supporters.</strong></p>
<p>This is completely fair to question. Alito is an extremely careful lawyer and a very precise judge. He is clearly taken with a certain view of our culture that is shared by many of Trump’s supporters. But is it possible to find an opinion in which he says, I’m going to go this way because the President is the law, or anything that verges on that? I think that’s very hard to find. Is there anything in his opinions that shows disrespect for freedom of speech or freedom of religion? I think that’s impossible to find. Thomas is an originalist. He’s the most committed originalist on the Court, who believes the Constitution should be understood in accordance with its original meaning. I don’t like that view much, but you can hold that view and be a liberal in the sense of believing in the rule of law, believing in freedom of speech. He does want to overrule New York Times v. Sullivan, but he’s not the only one who thinks that and that doesn’t make him illiberal. [<em>That decision, from 1964, raised the standard for defamation lawsuits in a way that is seen as crucial to press freedom.</em>] So I do agree with you. There are concerning things about political connections that appear, but in terms of the liberal tradition I’m not giving up on Justice Thomas.</p>
<p><strong>You may be the most hopeful man in America. You mentioned in the book that one of the key components of liberalism is human rights. I am thinking about a lot of Reagan Administration policy, especially in places like Latin America, and wondering whether you think the conservative movement has broadly believed in human rights. I think one critique of liberalism from people on the left is that liberalism is complacent about imperialism, specifically.</strong></p>
<p>O.K., so you’re right to press on human rights. I would single out as the holy trinity freedom, pluralism, and the rule of law. I do refer to human rights as part of what liberals are committed to. You can believe in human rights while disagreeing about what falls in the category.</p>
<p><strong>As you say in the first sentence of Chapter 1 of your book, “Liberals believe in six things: freedom, human rights, pluralism, security, the rule of law and democracy.”</strong></p>
<p>So, I put democracy and human rights there, and I believe it to be true. But there have been liberals in history who are, let’s say, ambiguous in their enthusiasm for democracy. Some people say you could have a liberal society that isn’t democratic. I disagree with that. In my view, democracy is a condition for liberalism. But liberals sharply disagree about what’s included in the category of human rights. You might think there’s a right to an education, as Roosevelt did. I certainly do. And other liberals would say that’s a policy that’s probably good, but there’s no right to it.</p>
<p>Now, on imperialism, generally, the question is what does it mean exactly? If it means that the United States interferes illegally with the activities of other nations, to say the least, there should be a presumption of a very strong form against that.</p>
<p><strong>This debate about what should actually be included when we think about human rights—that wasn’t what was going on with Reagan. The Reagan Administration would laud any dictator that it liked and garland them with praise.</strong></p>
<p>I hear you. So here you have [a clash between] human-rights enthusiasts who are cautious about making what they see as undue compromises for the sake of alliances and others who think that you can make temporary compromises of liberal principles for the sake of obtaining alliances that might insure that people’s rights are protected in the long term. And I feel I kind of have a division of labor within my family on that one, and I defer to spouse.</p>
<p><strong>Your spouse being Samantha Power.</strong></p>
<p>I defer to that human-rights advocate, who is also a realist. [<em>Power became famous in the nineteen-nineties for her journalistic work on issues of human rights, and was seen as an idealist. She later served in the Obama Administration as U.N. Ambassador, and in the Biden Administration as the head of U.S.A.I.D.</em>]</p>
<p><strong>You can defer to her. I was just asking because you put it in the first sentence.</strong></p>
<p>All I meant by human rights was some category of fears that are walled off from government intrusion. If you say, I believe in freedom of speech, freedom of religion, private property, freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures, and I don’t believe in social security, I don’t believe in a right to a home, I don’t believe in a right to be free from discrimination, I don’t believe in a right to education, then you can still be a liberal.</p>
<p><strong>In terms of human rights, I’ve always found it a little bit puzzling, given what you write, and given who your wife is, that you two were so close to Henry Kissinger. Of all the pre-Trump political figures in America, he is the one I think of as in some ways the opposite of liberal, given his behavior toward the rest of the world.</strong></p>
<p>I’ll tell you a story. I wrote a book a few years ago on Star Wars. We invited Dr. Kissinger to my Star Wars book party, and he said, “You wrote a book about Star Wars? Why’d you write a book about Star Wars?” He was puzzled and courteous, but really confused. And then he came to the book party, which was quite generous. He was a busy person.</p>
<p><strong>But, despite his busyness, he came to the book party.</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, and then I gave a talk on Star Wars, and he came up to me afterward and he said, “Oh, I see why you wrote a book on Star Wars. There’s a lot there. It’s, like, about families and it’s about governments and freedom.” The amount of curiosity and generosity that he showed was incomparable. I don’t know anyone who showed that level of curiosity and generosity. And we really got into Star Wars. He just wanted to think about it. I know there are strong views about his career, and I’m hardly an expert on his career.</p>
<p><strong>But your wife is one of the great human-rights experts in the world. I asked you about him being anti-liberal, and your response was that he was very nice to you about your book.</strong></p>
<p>About Star Wars.</p>
<p><strong>It is certainly a touching story. But that’s not totally an answer to the question.</strong></p>
<p>Yeah. Well, I don’t know. What he would think of this book I’d love to know.</p>
<p><strong>But no second thoughts about being friends with him or anything?</strong></p>
<p>I feel generally very grateful for friendship, and he was, when I knew him, a person of immense kindness. Those who think of him as someone who was something horrible or worse, I don’t know what to say about that.</p>
<p><strong>But you could have an opinion on it. You have an opinion on all kinds of things, right?</strong></p>
<p>Well, on him and his role in government, that’s not something I’ve particularly studied, so I don’t know. I know some people who think he was a horrible historic figure. They would say, “Would you be friends with Genghis Khan? Would you be friends with Stalin?” And I wouldn’t be friends with Stalin, so I concede that.</p>
<p><strong>Well, the next time someone brings up a terrible anecdote about Cambodia or Vietnam, I will definitely drop the Star Wars story to show that people have two sides.</strong></p>
<p>Yeah. And I get those who think you shouldn’t be friends with someone who did terrible things. I hear that. I can just say that he was, as a very large number of people would say, though many fewer would say it publicly, an extraordinarily generous friend.</p>
<p><strong>Professor, thank you so much for doing this.</strong></p>
<p>Great, thanks. If we go light on the Kissinger part, I wouldn’t complain, because it could dwarf everything else. ♦</p>
