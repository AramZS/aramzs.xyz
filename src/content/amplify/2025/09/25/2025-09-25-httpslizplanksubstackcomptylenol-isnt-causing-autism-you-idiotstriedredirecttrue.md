<h3>But crusty old men on the other hand...</h3>
<p>Picture this, bestie. A room full of powerful men, gray-haired and decades past their prime fertility, pointing fingers at pregnant women popping tylenol for a headache. The irony would be laughable if it weren’t so sinister.</p>

<p>Trump and his geriatric side-kicks just dropped the newest maternal blame bomb: <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx20d4lr67lo">tylenol causes autism.</a> Not the tylenol sitting in medicine cabinets for fifty years. Not the Tylenol that’s been poked, prodded, and studied by researchers who found... nothing. No, apparently it’s the tylenol that desperate pregnant women reach for when their bodies are literally reshaping themselves to create life.</p>

<p>But here’s what they won’t tell you, what makes yesterday’s clown show even more twisted: <strong>The science points to fathers.</strong></p>
<figure><div class="rw-embed-wrapper"><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JAcemutse-Y?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" type="video/mp4"/></div></figure>
<p>Every decade a man ages before conception, the autism risk climbs. It’s measurable. It’s documented. It’s more significant than maternal age. Older dads are also disproportionately responsible for miscarriages. A study of over 130,000 men found that fathers over 40 were 6x as likely to have children born autistic. It is believed that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6030011/">random mutations</a> in a man’s sperm pile up over the years, which can pass genetic mutations to a child and increase their chances of developing a psychological or neurocognitive disorder. But when was the last time you saw a headline screaming “OLDER DADS LINKED TO AUTISM”? When was the last time anyone suggested men freeze their sperm at 25, just in case?</p>
<p>Never. Because that would require scrutinizing men’s bodies and choices like we do with women. It would mean admitting that men have a biological clock. Not as a punchline, not as a jab about aging, but as a real biological fact. Every year, sperm cells accumulate new mutations, just as eggs do. The difference is that we talk about women’s clocks endlessly, while pretending men’s don’t exist. While I’ve written extensively about men’s biological clock <a href="https://lizplank.substack.com/p/should-men-freeze-their-sperm">right here on </a><em><a href="https://lizplank.substack.com/p/should-men-freeze-their-sperm">Airplane Mode</a></em>, it’s still nearly impossible to find the same obsessive scrutiny of men’s aging sperm that we routinely apply to women’s bodies.</p>

<p>Instead, we get this theater of cruelty where pregnant women become walking liability cases. Don’t drink coffee! Don’t eat sushi! Don’t take the one painkiller doctors say is safe. Meanwhile, the men crafting these narratives? Trump fathered Barron at nearly 60. RFK Jr. had his last kid when he was 47. These aren’t young studs, they’re genetic time bombs lecturing women about health risks that don’t even exist.</p>
<p><strong>And here’s the part that should make your blood boil:</strong> This isn’t really about health prevention. It’s about autism erasure. As I’ve written and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DH4IQeEBIdf/?locale=de">talked about on MSNBC</a>, this is a regime lead be a man who has reportedly told members of his own family <a href="https://time.com/7002003/donald-trump-disabled-americans-all-in-the-family/">that people disabilities shouldn’t exist</a> and we see that reflected in his policies and his cabinet. For instance, RFK Jr. recently claimed autistic people will “<em>will never pay taxes</em>” or “they’ll never hold a job.” That’s not concern, that’s contempt. That’s reducing entire human beings to imagined deficits while society actively works to erase them even further. It’s the kind of dehumanization that is tolerated in a deeply ableist society.</p>
<p>I’m making a <a href="https://www.elizabethplank.com/not-so-special-film">documentary called NOT SO SPECIAL</a> about this exact phenomenon, about how disabled children are pathologized out of existence instead of being seen for their potential, their brilliance, their irreplaceable humanity. And as I wait for a corporate sponsor to help us finish the film and get it to you, you are the one powering this work so thank you from the bottom of my heart. If you want to see it reach screens, to watch it detonate these lies in real time, you’re not just watching, you’re funding the revolution by being a subscriber.</p>

<p>Because here’s the truth they’re terrified you’ll figure out: <strong>Autism isn’t the monster. Misogyny is.</strong></p>
<p>The real scandal isn’t some phantom tylenol conspiracy. It’s that we live in a world where pregnant women are micromanaged for every molecular decision while the men with the microphones, men whose aging sperm carries the actual documented risks, lie to you.</p>
<p>They want you focused on the medicine cabinet so you won’t look at the boardroom. They want you policing women’s bodies so you won’t question their power. They want autism to sound like a tragedy so you won’t see disabled people as fully human.</p>
<p>Do not let them.</p>
<p>The fight isn’t just happening in Washington, it’s happening right here, in every share, every conversation, every refusal to let pregnant women become scapegoats for men’s scientific illiteracy and political cowardice.</p>
<p>You’re already in this fight. The question is: How far are you willing to take it? Can you share this piece with someone you know? Post about it on social media? As we saw with the Kimmel debacle this week, change is possible when your anger is properly channeled. Your voice matters. And you are not alone in feeling rage. That’s why I wanted our community to exist. I needed a reminder that I wasn’t losing my mind, that the gaslighting wasn’t working on everyone. All 43,000 of us are proof that we have the power to make a difference, even when the men in suits want us to believe we’re powerless.</p>
<p>Because these powerful men? They’re betting you’ll keep blaming women instead of questioning them. Time to prove them wrong.</p>
