<p>The US tech giant and the EU have repeatedly locked horns over the bloc's Digital Markets Act (DMA), which Brussels says seeks to make the digital sector in the 27-nation bloc fairer and more open.</p>
<p>"The DMA should be repealed while a more appropriate fit for purpose legislative instrument is put in place," Apple said in a formal submission to the European Commission as part of a consultation on the law.</p>
<p>The latest clash came as President Donald Trump sought to pressure the EU over decisions and laws affecting US Big Tech -- with key industry figures including Apple chief Tim Cook moving closer to the White House since Trump's return to power.</p>
<p>"It's become clear that the DMA is leading to a worse experience for Apple users in the EU," the tech giant said in a blog post accompanying its submission. "It's exposing them to new risks, and disrupting the simple, seamless way their Apple products work together."</p>
<p>Pushing for wholesale reform of the law if it is not repealed, Apple suggested enforcement "should be undertaken by an independent European agency" rather than the commission, the EU's executive arm and digital watchdog.</p>
<p>The DMA challenges Apple's closed ecosystem, but Brussels argues that it is necessary to do so to level the playing field for Apple's rivals and avoid unfair market domination.</p>
<p>The law tells Big Tech firms what they can and cannot do on their platforms. For example, companies must offer choice screens for web browsers and search engines to give users more options.</p>
<p>Violations of the DMA can lead to hefty fines.</p>
<p>Brussels in April slapped a 500-million-euro ($590-million) fine on Apple under the DMA, which the company has appealed.</p>
<h2>Delays for EU users</h2>
<p>Apple says dangers are posed when Europeans can download app marketplaces that rival its App Store.</p>
<p>The giant also cites an increasing number of complaints from users about DMA-related changes but has not provided exact figures.</p>
<p>It argued in its 25-page submission that the EU's law had forced it to delay new features in the bloc.</p>
<p>For example, Apple has not yet rolled out "live translation" -- which allows consumers to choose another language to hear via AirPods in their ears.</p>
<p>The technology was launched this month in the United States but Apple says it must undertake further engineering work to ensure users' privacy in the EU.</p>
<p>Under the DMA, companies including Apple must make sure their products can work seamlessly with third-party devices such as earphones.</p>
<p>The commission said it was "normal" companies sometimes needed more time to make sure their products were in line with the new law and that it was helping them comply.</p>
<p>DMA enforcement began in March 2024 and the EU's consultation on the first review of the law ended just before midnight on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Independently from the digital rules, Apple has faced the heat under different EU competition rules. Brussels slapped it with a 1.8-billion-euro fine in March 2024.</p>
