<p>Since Charlie Kirk was shot on Wednesday, political leaders and liberal pundits have all come out of the woodwork to condemn "political violence."</p>
<p>"The murder of Charlie Kirk is part of a disturbing rise in political violence that threatens to hollow out our public life," Bernie Sanders <a href="https://x.com/SenSanders/status/1966252385908699568">said on Thursday</a>. "Political violence has absolutely no place in our nation," Nancy Pelosi <a href="https://x.com/SpeakerPelosi/status/1965857741312045418">said</a>. "Political violence is completely incompatible with American values," Hakeem Jeffries <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-vance-lawmakers-react-shooting-charlie-kirk/story?id=125452435">posted</a>. "Political violence has no place in America," Kamala Harris <a href="https://x.com/KamalaHarris/status/1965864889651704135">echoed</a>.</p>
