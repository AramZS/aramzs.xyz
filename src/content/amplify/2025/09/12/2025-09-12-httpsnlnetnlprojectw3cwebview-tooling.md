<p><em>Contributing to standardisation of WebView in W3C</em></p>
<p>Web technologies like HTML, CSS and JavaScript are also used very much outside of a Web browser, because they are well standardized, openly available and many developers know how to build for the web. WebViews are software components used to render Web content inside native apps. They are integral to the mobile web experience, as in-app web content display for social media and serving as a foundation for entire applications and games built with web technologies. WebViews are, however, very much overlooked by web developers, web standards developers, and browser engine vendors in terms of compatibility and feature availability.</p>
<p>As part of the W3C WebView Community Group, this project addresses a critical gap in the web platform by establishing comprehensive testing infrastructure and resources for WebView compatibility. The initiative will deliver three key components: open-source testing applications for Android and iOS distributed through app stores, automated testing infrastructure using WebDriver-like tools for continuous compatibility monitoring, and the caniwebview.com website as resource for WebView compatibility data and documentation. Through regular meetings and conference sessions with stakeholders in the WebView space this project aims to improve the user experience, address common issues and lay foundations to future standards.</p>
