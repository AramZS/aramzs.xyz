<p>In the aftermath of Wednesday’s <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/09/conservative-influencer-charlie-kirk-shot-in-utah/">assassination of right-wing youth leader Charlie Kirk</a>, in the midst of more sober calls for mourning and moderation, many far-right influencers quickly began to <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/09/charlie-kirk-killing-assassination-reactions-right-wing-grief-outrage-retribution/">call for revenge against the left</a>—whom they blamed for Kirk’s death. They did so even though the shooter still has not been identified, nor their motivations revealed.</p>
<p>But it’s not just random individuals circulating such violent fantasies—leaders of prominent extremist groups and <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/01/trump-frees-violent-january-6-attackers/">pardoned insurrectionists</a> have issued calls to their networks to seek revenge. In an email to <em>Mother Jones</em>, Devin Burghart, executive director of the extremism research group Institute for Research and Education on Human Rights, expressed his concern that reactions to Kirk’s death could “energize the far-right to intensify political violence, from street clashes and armed paramilitarism to calls for racist terror.”</p>
<p>Consider the message from Stewart Rhodes, founder of the <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2010/02/oath-keepers/">Oath Keepers</a> militia group, who was <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2023/05/oath-keepers-founder-stewart-rhodes-18-years-january-6/">sentenced</a> to 18 years in prison for his role in leading the Capitol insurrection on January 6, 2021, before being <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/01/trump-january-6-pardons-jeremy-brown-daniel-ball-guy-reffitt/">pardoned</a> by President Donald Trump in January—along with nearly 1,600 others. On Wednesday, he <a href="https://rss.infowars.com/20250910_Wed_Alex.mp3">said</a> on Alex Jones’ <em>Infowars</em> podcast that he would be restarting his organization in the wake of Kirk’s killing. “I’m going to be rebuilding Oath Keepers,” Rhodes said, “and we will be doing protection again.” The group never formally disbanded but had receded from the spotlight after their leader’s conviction.</p>
<p>“One thing we will be doing is public protection of patriots again, like we used to—it’s incredibly necessary,” Rhodes added. “I’m sure the Proud Boys will agree—if we have to, we’ll go and ride the train again, just like the Guardian Angels did.” He was referring to the New York City vigilante group Republican mayoral candidate Curtis Sliwa started in 1979.</p>
<p>If his security team had been at Kirk’s event, Rhodes said, the 31-year-old founder of Turning Point USA would still be alive. He also urged men to “step up…do your tour of duty” and start their own vigilante groups. “It’s not just the responsibility of Oath Keepers and Proud Boys to protect Americans in this environment,” he continued, “it’s the responsibility of <em>all</em> American men.”</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>“It’s not just the responsibility of Oath <strong>K</strong>eepers and Proud Boys to protect Americans in this environment, it’s the responsibility of <em>all</em> American men.”</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>He then suggested that they should “start a neighborhood watch,” and should they find  “someone who doesn’t belong, let ‘em know you’re watching them.” Threats weren’t even necessary, “but you can let ‘em know you’re watching,” Rhodes said. “Usually, that’s a deterrent.”</p>
<p>Several other convicted insurrectionists also said they plan to avenge Kirk’s death, noting that he had strenuously encouraged that they be freed from prison. “Charlie was a HUGE advocate for our unconditional release…He helped restore the lives of 1,600 of us,” <a href="https://x.com/NobleOne/status/1965878739453235572">wrote</a> Enrique Tarrio, leader of the militia-like group the Proud Boys, who was <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/pr/proud-boys-leader-sentenced-22-years-prison-seditious-conspiracy-and-other-charges">sentenced</a> to 22 years in prison for his role in coordinating the attack on the Capitol. He, too, was pardoned by President Trump. “I think I can speak for ALL J6ers when I say THANK YOU…We carry the torch.”</p>
<p>Jake Lang, who was accused of beating officers at the Capitol but <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/21/us-news/jake-lang-gets-trial-delay-in-hopes-of-trump-pardon-on-jan-6-charges/">avoided</a> going to trial before being pardoned and is currently <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Jake_Lang">running</a> for US Senate in Florida, <a href="https://x.com/JakeLangJ6/status/1965931785365393506">called</a> for “a MILLION MAN MARCH on DC to show solidarity” with both Kirk and Iryna Zarutska, a Ukrainian refugee who was <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/08/us/iryna-zarutska-murder-ukraine-refugee">killed</a> on a train in North Carolina last month. <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/09/charlotte-murder-exposes-democrat-failures-after-career-criminal-freed-by-woke-policies/">The Trump administration</a> and other Republicans have blamed Zarutska’s murder on Democrats, alleging that the killing was directly connected to the party for being what they <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/iryna-zarutska-fled-ukraine-safety-democrats-soft-on-crime-policies-failed-her">describe</a> as too “soft on crime.” The killer, who had a lengthy criminal history, is <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-charges-light-rail-attacker-federal-crime">facing</a> federal charges. “THE TIME TO RISE IS NOW,” Lang wrote.</p>
<p>Chris Worrell, a member of the Proud Boys, was <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/pr/florida-proud-boy-sentenced-felony-charges-assaulting-police-officers-during-jan-6">convicted</a> of assaulting a group of police officers on January 6 and sparked a six-week-long manhunt while he tried to evade authorities. “The POLITICAL ASSASSINATION of [Kirk] MUST see RETRIBUTION!!” he <a href="https://x.com/J6377183/status/1965863646778765450">wrote</a> on X. Another convicted insurrectionist and Oath Keeper, Jessica Watkins, <a href="https://x.com/J6ssicaWatkins/status/1966056644845977929">said</a>, “Charlie Kirk’s assassination pulled me out of retirement. More work must be done.” Just twelve hours earlier, Watkins had <a href="https://x.com/J6ssicaWatkins/status/1965875827041853947">written</a> to fellow Kirk fans who were upset about the shooting, “talks about Civil War are counterproductive. Please Stop. It’s not helping.”</p>
<p>The neo-Nazis weighed in with a <a href="https://x.com/ryanasanchez/status/1966011926078697507">post</a> on X from <a href="https://extremismterms.adl.org/glossary/nationalist-network#:~:text=The%20Nationalist%20Network%20is%20a,and%20the%20Active%20Club%20network.&amp;text=This%20database%20provides%20an%20overview,promote%20extremist%20or%20hateful%20ideologies.">Nationalist Network</a> leader Ryan Sanchez: “Charlie Kirk must be avenged. We must destroy the Left once and for all!” In another tweet, he <a href="https://x.com/ryanasanchez/status/1965996421120930066">wrote</a>, “WHITE MAN FIGHT BACK!” On his <a href="https://ryansanchez.us/">website</a>, Sanchez says he is “fighting for J6 prisoners.”</p>
<p>As incendiary as these posts may appear, some experts do not believe the former insurrectionists pose as legitimate a threat as they did in 2021. “These people <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/08/who-is-behind-trump-administration-social-media-posts/">cry civil war when Cracker Barrel changes their logo</a>,” said <a href="https://extremism.gwu.edu/jon-lewis">Jon Lewis</a>, a research fellow at the Program on Extremism at George Washington University. He sees some of the loudest voices calling for retribution, like Rhodes and Tarrio, as mere “grifters,” adding, “I’m not worried about, like, the Oath Keepers bringing 1,000 guys to DC tomorrow.”</p>
<p>Lewis pointed to Tarrio’s recent <a href="https://x.com/NobleOne/status/1966016260871012596">announcement</a> that he would not attend a DC court hearing scheduled for Thursday, where he was supposed to appear in connection with a lawsuit that the Metropolitan African Methodist Episcopal Church filed (and <a href="https://www.lawyerscommittee.org/lawyers-committee-statement-on-the-metropolitan-ame-church-being-granted-the-proud-boy-trademark/">won</a>) against the Proud Boys for vandalizing its Washington, DC, church building in 2020. “They want me to travel to totally unsafe DC in a time where conservative voices are under threat,” Tarrio <a href="https://x.com/NobleOne">posted</a>.</p>
<p>John Rennie Short, professor emeritus of public policy at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, and author of <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/insurrection-what-the-january-6-assault-on-the-capitol-reveals-about-america-and-democracy-john-rennie-short/a9000e85ac29657f?ean=9781789148411&amp;next=t"><em>Insurrection: What the January 6 Assault on the Capitol Reveals About America and Democracy</em>,</a> sees the insurrectionists’ calls for retribution as an effort to “raise that anger level again” after losing their relevance with Trump’s return to office. “It’s a great business model for them,” he added.</p>
<p>What these experts<em> are</em> concerned about, though, is how these messages from influencers with such a wide online reach could inspire lone actors to inflict violence. “They’re now being told that the same people who tried to steal this country away from you just killed Charlie Kirk,” Lewis said, “and someone has to do something about that.”</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>“They’re now being told that the same people who tried to steal this country away from you just killed Charlie Kirk, and someone has to do something about that.” </p></blockquote></figure>
<p>There’s also concern that the Trump administration may use the insurrectionists’ sense of grievance to, as Burghart put it, “further [their] authoritarian plans.” After all, Attorney General Pam Bondi already <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/attorney-general-pam-bondi-fires-jan-6-prosecutors-capitol-riot-doj-rcna215661">fired</a> multiple prosecutors who pursued cases against the insurrectionists, and both FBI Director <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/01/kash-patel-confirmation-hearing-fbi-extremism-january-6/">Kash Patel</a> and Deputy Director <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/03/dan-bongino-fbi-podcast-maga-trump-sponsors/">Dan Bongino</a> have promoted conspiracy theories about the attack.</p>
<p>In an address to the nation Wednesday night, President Trump explicitly <a href="https://x.com/cspan/status/1965957282694398250/video/1">blamed</a> his political opponents for Kirk’s death: “For years, those on the radical left have compared wonderful Americans like Charlie to Nazis and the world’s worst mass murderers and criminals,” he said. “This kind of rhetoric is directly responsible for the terrorism that we’re seeing in our country today, and it must stop right now.”</p>

<p>Rennie Short sees Trump’s baseless politicization of the tragedy as serving to distract from some of his own <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/09/nbc-poll-trump-vaccines-immigration-trade-approval/">troubling political failures</a>. “It takes attention away from <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/09/epstein-file-release-survivors/">the Epstein files</a>,” he said, “from <a href="https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-qatar-attack-09-09-25">Israel bombing allies</a>, or Putin continuing to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/09/world/europe/ukraine-bombing-donetsk-pensioners.html">savagely attack Ukraine</a>.”</p>
<p>Nonetheless, this messaging from the insurrectionists and echoed by the highest officials in government could still have serious consequences. “Especially for people who already assaulted law enforcement on January 6 and were pardoned,” Lewis said, “there is certainly going to be an expectation that, if they answer the call again, they could have the same outcome.”</p>
