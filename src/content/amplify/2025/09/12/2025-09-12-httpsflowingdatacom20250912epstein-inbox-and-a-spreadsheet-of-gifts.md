<p>Bloomberg gained access to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2025-jeffrey-epstein-emails-ghislaine-maxwell/?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1NzYyMjAxOSwiZXhwIjoxNzU4MjI2ODE5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUMkYyQ0tHUEZIUUUwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiIzRDhGMEEzMTc2MDc0NUM5OTg4NkFCNzA1NDk2RUNEQSJ9.3PrMy0uRrHOj5j-DFbnBLheTsTY5e_CAQ5glz4p8WBw">an email cache from Jeffrey Epstein’s Yahoo Mail inbox</a>, spanning two decades between 2002 and 2022. They highlight the relationship between Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell and how the timing and nature of the emails reflect a closer timeline than Maxwell has suggested.</p>
<p>The cache also included a spreadsheet from Epstein’s accountant that lists gifts and payments, such as watches and massage lessons. Bloomberg charted three years of transactions with a bubble chart over time.</p>
<p>It’s only a fraction of Epstein emails, as he used multiple addresses over decades, but it’s quite the digital trace.
