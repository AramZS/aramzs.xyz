<p>Tyler Robinson, apprehended last night in connection to the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/776079/charlie-kirk-shooting">fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk</a>, allegedly left engraved bullets at the crime scene that were covered in a furry meme, a reference from the video game <em>Helldivers 2, </em>and an extremely online taunt.</p>
<p>In an FBI briefing this morning about his arrest, Utah Gov. Spencer Cox described the sequence of events that led to the capture of Robinson, 22, who was turned into the police by his father. They also clarified the nature of the notes engraved on the bullet casings found at the scene, which had been rumored to be slogans relating to antifascist and “transgender ideology.” As it turns out, the messages are a confusing mix of internet memes and pop culture.</p>
<p>As described, the bullets read (exact capitalization not confirmed at this point):</p>
<ul><li>“Notices bulges OWO what’s this?”</li><li>“Hey fascist! Catch!” Up arrow symbol, right arrow, three down arrow symbols</li><li>“Oh bella ciao bella ciao bella ciao ciao ciao”</li><li>“If you read this, you are gay lmao”</li></ul>
<p>The first bullet casing, which was fired, is a meme referring to furry online roleplay, according to <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/notices-bulge-owo-whats-this">Know Your Meme</a>.</p>
<p>It’s not hard to see where the “antifascist” conclusion came from on two of the other bullets: “Bella ciao” is an Italian song adopted by partisans and resistance fighters while Italy was governed by the fascist dictator Benito Mussolini. Cox said in response to a question during the conference that the “hey fascist” message “speaks for itself.” Three downward-slanting arrows are a symbol used by both historical and contemporary antifascists.</p>
<p>But the full arrow sequence was quickly recognized as something else: a combo from <em>Helldivers 2</em> for calling the <a href="https://helldivers.fandom.com/wiki/Eagle_500kg_Bomb">Eagle 500kg Bomb</a> stratagem. The world of <em>Helldivers</em> — which evokes Robert Heinlein’s book <em>Starship Troopers</em> and the subsequent movie — concerns fascism thematically; developer Arrowhead has <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/the-united-nations-asked-helldivers-2-studio-arrowhead-if-itd-give-a-talk-on-psychological-manipulation-could-we-brainwash-an-entire-community-to-fight-for-a-fascist-state-would-we-be-okay-with-that-turns-out-yeah/">characterized it as a satire</a> where players fight for a fascist state.</p>
<p>As for the use of “Bella ciao,” the song has no obvious connection but given its historical significance, unsurprisingly does appear in a <em>Helldivers 2 </em>mod, as well as in at least one other video game, a World War II-themed strategy game called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-qTuXDEnFo"><em>Hearts of Iron IV</em></a>.</p>
<p>The fatal shooting of Kirk on Wednesday led to an intense manhunt across Utah, though it encountered numerous complications along the way. Several leads, publicly teased by FBI Director Kash Patel, quickly petered out. Leaked documents from law enforcement published by MAGA influencers led to false narratives about how markings on the bullet indicated that the shooter was in favor of “transgender ideology.”</p>
<p>It was nearly impossible to divorce politics and internet misinformation from Kirk’s death, however. The 31-year-old was a powerful figure in the MAGA movement, as the founder and leader of the right-wing college group Turning Point USA, and a prominent podcaster and MAGA influencer himself, famous for appearing on college campuses to confront liberal students. President Donald Trump credited Kirk and TPUSA as a factor in his return to office, and frequently relied on him as an emissary to youth voters.</p>
<blockquote><p>The messages on the shooter’s bullet casings can best be described as bizarre and extremely online</p></blockquote>
<p>In the aftermath of Kirk’s death, his allies in the MAGA movement, including lawmakers and influencers, promised swift retribution against the left should the killer share their ideology. The themes of <em>Helldivers 2</em> could have an ideological meaning, albeit not necessarily a straightforward one. But ultimately, the messages on the shooter’s bullet casings can best be described as bizarre and extremely online.</p>
<p>According to the FBI, evidence leading to Robinson’s arrest included screenshots from his roommate’s Discord chat, in which he mentioned leaving a rifle wrapped in a towel in some bushes. Law enforcement recovered a Mauser .30-06 from an area near the campus that was wrapped in a towel.</p>
<p>Fans of the game immediately noticed. Shortly after the press conference on Friday morning, the <em>Helldivers</em> subreddit was flooded with players who had picked up on what may be references to the game. A thread, now deleted, was titled: “Hey Facist Catch!” with the poster asking, “Did anyone else hear/notice?!” A commenter, responding to the thread, said, “The moment I heard [the arrows] my eyes widened.”</p>
<p>Another thread, also apparently deleted by moderators, referenced the arrows that authorities say were on one of the unfired bullet casings recovered at the scene. “It sickens me having people like this playing this game and using it to real violence to tarnish this awesome game and community,” the poster wrote. Other posts implored the subreddit moderators to lock down the forum. Moderators for the subreddit didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. A <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/helldivers2/comments/1nf5sxh/damn_not_for_nothing_but_its_gonna_be_weird_to/">thread in the separate r/Helldivers2 subreddit</a> remains active, with people discussing the apparent parallels.</p>
<p>Arrowhead, the maker of the <em>Helldivers</em> games, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
