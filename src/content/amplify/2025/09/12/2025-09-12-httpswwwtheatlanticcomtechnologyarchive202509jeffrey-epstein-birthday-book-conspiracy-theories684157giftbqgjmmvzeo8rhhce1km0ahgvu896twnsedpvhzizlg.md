  Jeffrey Epstein’s 50th-birthday book is a sickening document. It’s also a rare
  look at what happens when conspiracy theorists actually get what they want,
  Charlie Warzel argues.

title: You Really Need to See Epstein’s Birthday Book for Yourself

<html><body><div>This time, the conspiracy theorists were right.</div><figure><img alt="Jeffrey Epstein" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/5rw2KpNMH5X4Vs9_1YmDUxPG8QU=/0x0:2000x1125/960x540/media/img/mt/2025/09/2025_09_epstein_book_b/original.jpg"/><figcaption> (Photo-illustration by The Atlantic. Source: Rick Friedman / Corbis / Getty.)</figcaption></figure><p><small><em>Updated at 2:38 p.m. ET on September 10, 2025</em></small></p><p>Looking back, I don’t know what exactly I was expecting when I opened “Request No. 1,” the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZSVpXEhI7gKI0zatJdYe6QhKJ5pjUo4b">PDF file</a> containing the contents of Jeffrey Epstein’s 50th-birthday book. Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein’s former girlfriend and co-conspirator, created the book in 2003 by soliciting tributes from the financier’s friends and associates. Given the crimes Epstein was convicted of, I steeled myself before scrolling. Somehow, my internet-addled imagination failed me. This book is a nightmare.</p><p></p><p>The book was released yesterday by Congress after Epstein’s estate, which was subpoenaed by the House Oversight Committee, provided a copy. It is the same book that contains the now-infamous letter and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/trump-jeffrey-epstein-birthday-letter-we-have-certain-things-in-common-f918d796">“bawdy”</a> sketch from Donald Trump that ends: “May every day be another wonderful secret.” When <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> reported on the letter’s existence in July, the newspaper described it but did not republish the letter itself, so Trump vehemently denied that it was real and sued for <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/09/trump-epstein-birthday-letter-reaction-democrats">defamation</a>. But the now-public letter certainly looks real, and so does Trump’s signature. Many of the people who encountered it for the first time yesterday made a similar observation: Its creepy prose is framed by a markered sketch of what looks like the caricature not of a woman’s body, but of a girl’s. (The White House can no longer plausibly deny that the letter exists, but it now insists that Trump did not write or sign it.)</p><p></p><p>The Trump letter makes the birthday book inherently newsworthy. But it is far from the most disturbing or lecherous of the book’s contents. A section titled “Brooklyn” includes recollections of Epstein’s horrible sexual escapades, apparently including making a maid watch people have sex and holding a knife up while telling women to take off their swimsuits on a boat—a story told in the book under the heading “Girls on My Boat.” Given what we know about Epstein’s sex crimes, including his sex crimes against minors, the birthday book is a sickening document. Over its 238 pages, Epstein’s friends, “girlfriends,” and business acquaintances offer lurid tributes to the pedophilic multimillionaire in the form of acrostic poems, drawings, and letters extolling him as “a liver, a lover,” and, affectionately, the “Degenerate One.” Individual contributions vary, but it is the sheer volume of sexual references and jokes that ends up being most shocking. So much so that I suggest you read the document yourself.</p><p></p><p>The book’s <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.wsj.com/us-news/see-more-pages-from-epsteins-50th-birthday-book-7ed82f58?mod=hp_lead_pos7">contributors</a> apparently include former President Bill Clinton, former U.S. Senator George Mitchell, the billionaire retailer Leslie Wexner, and, of course, Maxwell herself, as well as a prominent fashion designer, financiers, and a media magnate. Clinton, Mitchell, and Wexner did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A spokesman for Clinton referred <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> to a previous statement that said, “The former president had cut off ties more than a decade before Epstein’s 2019 arrest and didn’t know about Epstein’s alleged crimes.” Wexner declined to comment to the <em>Journal</em> but previously told reporters he cut ties with Epstein in 2007.</p><p></p><p>Not all of the entries in the book allude to sexual activity, and it’s plausible that not all of the contributors knew about Epstein’s crimes. Still, the document is conspiracy jet fuel—visual and textual confirmation of the long-held suspicions that Epstein’s sex pestery was an open secret, enabled by powerful people who may have participated in it themselves or laughed it all off as a friend’s roguish quirk. Of course, discerning who knew what is impossible from this document alone, but it also forces the question. For roughly the past five years, the Epstein conspiracy has become a load-bearing pillar of online conspiracy culture—a shorthand for a global, elite “cabal” of sex traffickers on private islands and planes. The web of theories surrounding his crimes was based on plenty of truth, including Epstein’s past conviction, but also extensive investigative reporting from the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/article220097825.html"><em>Miami Herald</em>’s</a> Julie K. Brown. Questions about the specific details of his network, however, have kept speculation alive. The birthday book seems likely to supercharge these theories. The PDF is but the tip of the supposed “Epstein files” iceberg, but it is nonetheless a validation of the most potent idea within the broader conspiracy: It suggests that the theorists were at least partly correct.</p><p></p><p>Sanitizing this document would be wrong, so I’ll be blunt: The Epstein birthday book is full of contributions from wealthy and powerful people who appear fully aware of Epstein’s attraction to “girls.” In fact, they seem to celebrate it and, in some cases, allude winkingly to Epstein’s predatory lifestyle. There is, for example, a seven-page letter attributed to Nathan Myhrvold, a multimillionaire and former Microsoft executive who illustrated his thoughts with graphic photographs of wildlife sex. (Melissa Lukach, a spokesperson for Myhrvold, responded to my request for comment after publication and said that Myhrvold knew Epstein “from TED conferences and as a donor to basic scientific research. He regrets that he ever met him.”) Another man, listed in the “friends” section of the book, refers to Epstein as “you very dear boy,” before disturbingly recounting a night in London that “had you howling with laughter.” In the story, a man named Toto “reached down and pulled [redacted] skirt up to her panties and put his hand on her pussy,” he writes, noting, “The old man smiling sweetly leaned over stuffed his hand into her pants.” The letter also chronicles the “good times that we had together,” the pair “inspecting the Royal School girls dorms.”</p><p></p><p>Wexner, the retail billionaire, apparently wrote a short message that said, “I wanted to get you what you want … so here it is,” and then drew a pair of breasts. Stuart Pivar, a chemist and art collector, apparently wrote a poem to Epstein, part of which declares, “Jeffrey at half a century / with credentials plenipotentiary / though up to no good / whenever he could / has avoided the penitentiary.” Pivar told me in an email that he recalled Maxwell having invited him to contribute to the book even though he and Epstein “were no longer that close.” He also described Epstein as “vastly misunderstood” and a “teenophile” rather than a “pedophile.” (In 2019, Pivar called Epstein <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.motherjones.com/criminal-justice/2019/08/jeffrey-epstein-my-very-very-sick-pal/">“profoundly sick”</a> in an interview with <em>Mother Jones</em> and said he cut ties with Epstein once he heard from Maria Farmer about “a terrible thing, too terrible to utter, having to do with Jeffrey Epstein.”)</p><p></p><p>Joel Pashcow, a real-estate executive and Mar-a-Lago Club member, offered a drawing of Epstein giving a lollipop to a group of young girls in 1983, juxtaposed with another drawing of Epstein in 2003 being fellated and massaged by another gaggle of women. The implication is that Epstein has groomed them from an early age. Paschow did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But his most startling contribution is a photo of him holding a novelty check bearing what appears to be a doctored or rendered version of Trump’s signature. The photo appears alongside a handwritten note suggesting Epstein sold him a “fully depreciated” woman for $22,500. <em>The New York Times</em> reports that the check was a stunt <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/09/us/epstein-trump-birthday-book.html">meant as a joke</a> about a woman in her 20s who dated both Trump and Epstein. But this is remarkable enough that it bears repeating: Inside the 50th-birthday book for Jeffrey Epstein—a man charged with sex trafficking—is a photo of a massive, novelty size check, seeming to reference the sale of a human being from one powerful man to another. The man whose supposed signature is on the check is the current president of the United States.</p><figure><img alt="An illustration from Jeffrey Epstein's birthday book" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/HWhj-VS33M8IBTlLM2Os1HW_Y08=/665x527/media/img/posts/2025/09/Screenshot_2025_09_09_at_10.51.39PM/original.png"/><figcaption>One of the illustrations in Jeffrey Epstein’s birthday book (U.S. House Oversight Committee)</figcaption></figure><p>I’ve <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2025/07/trump-epstein-late-stage-conspiracism/683570/">written before</a> that the Epstein story is a test of exactly how strong Trump’s grip is on the MAGA faithful. Exposing depraved elites and bringing them to justice has been a core tenet of many Trump supporters’ politics, and those people have just been served more details of Trump’s association with Epstein. Two things are converging here: A conspiratorial crowd is getting the kind of evidence it craves, on an internet that supercharges conspiratorial speculating. At the same time, this is happening in a media ecosystem that makes it easier than ever for people to ignore, dismiss, or spin evidence to justify their prior viewpoints. The birthday book is not just a test of Trump’s influence but also a test of the power of our current, broken media ecosystem, as well as a rare look at what happens when conspiracy theorists actually get what they want.</p><p></p><p>So far, the right-wing media ecosystem appears to be doing a good job dismissing the story. MAGA pundits have avoided talking about the documents or outright denied what they seem to depict. Alex Jones, who has been so obsessed with the Epstein story for years that he <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.facebook.com/Variety/posts/alex-jones-broke-down-in-tears-on-video-after-the-doj-and-fbis-epstein-memo-foun/1094253152565512/">broke down</a> in tears when the administration said it wouldn’t produce the late financier’s client list, had no mention of the book on his Infowars website as of midday. Fox News’s <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/inside-epsteins-infamous-birthday-book-clintons-note-poolside-candids-bizarre-animal-pics">article</a> about the birthday book, which was on its front page earlier this evening, mentions Clinton in the headline but contains zero mention of Trump at all. MAGA pundits including Charlie Kirk are <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://x.com/charliekirk11/status/1965128289808515385">suggesting</a> that Trump’s signature is fake. Benny Johnson, another MAGA personality, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.mediamatters.org/benny-johnson/benny-johnson-suggests-jeffrey-epstein-forged-trumps-letter">suggested</a> on his YouTube show today that Epstein forged Trump’s signature.</p><p></p><p>Curiously, Elon Musk’s X, which thrives on conspiracy theories, did not have any Epstein mention in its “Trending Topics” page this morning and early afternoon. Anecdotally, my “For You” page on X, a reliable hotbed of rampant speculation and Epstein obsession, surfaced almost nothing about the book. There’s no hard evidence to suggest that X is suppressing this content, and yet Musk has previously put his thumb on the algorithmic scales, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-twitter-x-links-lazy-linking-2024-11">suppressing</a> links to articles across the platform, for example. (X and Musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment.)</p><p></p><p>Images from the birthday book are littered across numerous threads on 4chan’s “politically incorrect” message board, and some users have suggested that Democrats are spamming the site. Overall, though, the reaction to the book feels somewhat muted, given its contents. Despite the volume of posts, the tone across social media feels disproportionately apathetic. “So what do you want to do about it?” one poster wrote in response to the Trump letter. Even in communities such as Reddit’s r/conspiracy, there seems to be a broad feeling of not knowing what exactly to do with this information. Some threads contain the usual amateur sleuthing and theorizing. There is also a good bit of anger toward Trump and Epstein. But among those who have engaged with the document, much of the reaction has a “dog that caught the car” vibe. The conversations aren’t spiraling in the ways I’ve witnessed before. It is the closest thing to a forum being satisfied that I’ve seen in a long time. “Umm what in the fuck,” one popular <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1nc3r3o/photo_out_of_epsteins_bday_book/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">post</a> on r/conspiracy reads. What else is there to say when the awful subtext becomes text?</p><p></p><p>So much of the potency of the Epstein conspiracy is that it speaks to a core feeling for many Americans that the alienation, stagnation, and fear they experience is all the result of a genuinely evil class of elites. The feeling is tied to distrust in institutions and to any person or thing that could potentially be labeled as part of a vague establishment. (And, as with many conspiracy theories, there is also a strong thread of anti-Semitism that emerges in many Epstein discussions.) The sexual deviancy of Epstein, just like the obsession among QAnon adherents with pedophilia, provides a moral framework for this hatred and disgust. It suggests that the people keeping you down are evil, doing sick things—and joking about it.The book is not the smoking-gun proof of the pedophile ring that many theorists were looking for, but it is proof of the conspiracy’s overarching worldview: There is a festering rot among at least one group of powerful elites with an abiding belief that their money and power make them invincible.</p><p></p><p>And yet it is not clear that any of this will go away, no matter what happens next. The dynamic of conspiracy theories is that they build, in scope and in tension. In doing so, they become a limitless repository for people’s excitement, fears, and resentments. Because of this, conspiracy theories are not really supposed to resolve. Resolution, in fact, can be the most unpredictable outcome. It is the point at which highly invested people find out whether the reality they’ve been clinging to actually exists.</p></body></html>
