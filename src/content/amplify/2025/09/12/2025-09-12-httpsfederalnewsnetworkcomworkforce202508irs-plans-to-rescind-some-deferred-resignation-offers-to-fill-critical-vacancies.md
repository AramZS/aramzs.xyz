<p>The IRS will allow some employees who accepted incentives to leave the agency to keep their jobs, amid concerns that the agency is losing too much of its workforce ahead of next year’s filing season.</p>
<p>The agency’s human resources office told employees in an email Wednesday that the IRS will allow some employees to rescind their deferred resignation applications, “to fill critical vacancies.”</p>
<p>Acting IRS Human Capital Officer David Traynor and acting Deputy IRS Chief Human Capital Officer David Allen told employees, in an email obtained by Federal News Network, that the agency plans to rescind some deferred resignation offers “to fill critical vacancies.”</p>
<p>“IRS has identified areas where staffing reductions created a potential gap in mission-critical expertise. As a result, IRS will utilize all available tools – including details, reassignments, DRP/TDRP receissions, external hiring – to identify resources to fulfill the mission-critical skill sets,” they wrote.</p>
<p>The IRS and the Treasury Department did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>An IRS watchdog <a href="https://federalnewsnetwork.com/workforce/2025/06/irs-watchdog-warns-of-tax-filing-challenges-next-year-after-agency-cuts-25-of-workforce/">recently warned</a> that taxpayers may face challenges during next year’s filing season, after the agency lost more than 25% of its employees under the Trump administration.</p>
<p>An IRS employee told Federal News Network that they were told by management in a recent town hall that the agency “let too many people go.”</p>
<p>The employee said the IRS plans to bring back 400 revenue agents and 300 revenue officers who accepted the DRP.</p>
<p>“They will begin agency-initiated DRP recissions for mission-critical occupations, where they reach out and offer the employee a chance to return,” the employee said, adding that “employee-initiated DRP recissions are not being entertained.”</p>
<p>According to the email, employees will soon be contacted by the IRS Human Capital Office with the process for signing a DRP rescission agreement, “upon Treasury approval.”</p>
<p>“No action is required on your part at this time. Managers will receive additional information and guidance from HCO on how to bring back an employee who has an approved DRP/TDRP recission agreement,” the email states.</p>
<p>The National Treasury Employees Union <a href="https://federalnewsnetwork.com/workforce/2025/08/irs-rescinds-layoffs-at-civil-rights-office-an-early-target-of-workforce-cuts/">filed a national grievance</a> in May, calling on the IRS to accept employees’ requests to withdraw their participation in the deferred resignation program.</p>
<p>NTEU National President Doreen Greenwald said in a statement that “American taxpayers will be the biggest beneficiaries of the decision by the Treasury Department to hire back some of the IRS employees forced out in recent months.”</p>
<p>“NTEU and other IRS advocacy groups have been warning that the massive, indiscriminate job cuts this year were jeopardizing the agency’s ability to meet its mission, and we are pleased that the administration now realizes it cannot afford to lose more of these trained, nonpartisan professionals,” Greenwald said.</p>
<p>Before <a href="https://federalnewsnetwork.com/management/2025/08/trump-removes-billy-long-as-irs-commisioner-less-than-2-months-after-his-confirmation/">stepping down</a> earlier this month, former IRS Commissioner Billy Long <a href="https://federalnewsnetwork.com/workforce/2025/08/irs-rescinds-layoffs-at-civil-rights-office-an-early-target-of-workforce-cuts/">reversed reduction-in-force notices</a> sent to employees at the Office of Civil Rights and Compliance, the first IRS office to receive RIF notices.</p>
<h2><strong>IRS starts gathering feedback on possible Direct File alternatives</strong></h2>
<p>The IRS is gathering public feedback on free tax filing options — including its own platform that’s at risk of elimination.</p>
<p>The IRS launched a <a href="https://irsresearch.gov1.qualtrics.com/jfe/preview/previewId/a9619aa2-8fec-4e28-a524-ad5386ef279c/SV_ewDJ6DeBj3ockGa?Q_CHL=preview&amp;Q_SurveyVersionID=current">congressionally mandated survey</a> on Thursday, asking taxpayers for their thoughts on Direct File, a free, online tax filing option the IRS launched in a dozen states in 2024 and expanded to 25 states during this year’s filing season, as well as possible alternatives.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://federalnewsnetwork.com/workforce/2025/07/shrinking-irs-faces-major-task-to-implement-big-beautiful-bill-passed-by-congress/">“Big, Beautiful Bill”</a> that President Donald Trump signed last month gave the Treasury Department $15 million to launch a task force and research alternatives to Direct File that would allow up to 70% of all taxpayers to file their tax returns for free.</p>
<p>The department, as part of a report to Congress, will determine whether taxpayers prefer a taxpayer-funded, government-run service or a free service provided by the private sector. The IRS will collect responses through Sept. 2. The Treasury has until Oct. 2 to submit a report to Congress.</p>
<p>An earlier version of the bill would have required the <a href="https://federalnewsnetwork.com/congress/2025/05/irs-would-eliminate-direct-file-under-trump-backed-budget-reconciliation-bill/">IRS to eliminate Direct File.</a></p>
<p>If a respondent says they are more likely to use a free online tax preparation program “paid for and operated by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS),” they get a follow-up question, asking if they’d still be interested if “setting up and running the program is expected to have an initial cost to the federal government of at least $10-20 per return processed.”</p>
<p>A former IRS official who worked on Direct File told Federal News Network that the $10-20 cost estimate per return is accurate, assuming the platform was deployed to all 50 states.</p>
<p><a href="https://federalnewsnetwork.com/it-modernization/2025/05/irs-direct-file-sees-higher-scores-among-users-despite-a-push-to-shutter-it/">Nearly 300,000 taxpayers</a> in 25 states filed their federal tax returns using Direct File this year — up from 140,000 tax returns filed when the platform launched in a dozen states last year. Direct File saw higher favorability scores from users this year, compared to last year.</p>
<p>Amy Paris, a former product manager at the U.S. Digital Service and one of the first members of the Direct File team, said the IRS survey selectively highlights the costs of an IRS-run filing system, but doesn’t mention the costs associated with other options, such as a privately run platform.</p>
<p>“If you’re designing a survey that is trying to legitimately find out what taxpayers prefer, you would provide them with the same amount of information for all of the options. So if you want to provide them with cost information, then you have then you should be providing cost information for all of the options,” Paris said. “The fact that they’re only providing cost information for Direct File leads me to believe that they want to lead the witness.”</p>
<p>Long recently said at a tax conference last month that Direct File is “gone,” according to <a href="https://news.bloombergtax.com/daily-tax-report/irs-chief-says-direct-file-is-gone-other-audit-tech-is-coming">Bloomberg Tax</a>.</p>
<p>Ayushi Roy, chief program officer at New Practice Lab and lead contributor to the independent third-party feasibility review of Direct File in 2023, said the survey’s design “really raises eyebrows.”</p>
<p>Roy said many <strong>— </strong>but not all <strong>— </strong>of the employees who worked on Direct File have left the IRS. However, she said the IRS is “trying to now go back to the drawing board” after successfully launching Direct File.</p>
<p>“I am genuinely curious, as a technologist, how do you provide a commensurate level of experience and service when you have scrapped the infrastructure that you need to be building?” Roy said.</p>
<p>Adam Ruben, vice president of campaigns and political strategy at the Economic Security Project, said the IRS spends about $10 to process paper tax returns, and that Direct File incentivized more taxpayers to file electronically, saving the federal government money in the long term.</p>
<p>“It’s true, it costs some money to build this new groundbreaking technology, and then there’s a bunch of savings that come from that over time that, of course, are not contemplated in this stilted online poll,” Ruben said.</p>
<p>Critics of Direct File say it competes with software from tax-preparation companies, and that the IRS spent tens of millions of dollars to launch the platform. Former IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel told reporters last year that <a href="https://federalnewsnetwork.com/it-modernization/2024/05/irs-makes-direct-file-permanent-option-to-file-taxes-online-invites-all-states-to-opt-in/">launching Direct File cost nearly $32 million</a>.</p>

<p>The survey asks respondents how they prepared their taxes during this year’s filing season, and how interested they are in using a free, online tax preparation program to file their taxes next year.</p>
<p>It also asks respondents to select which features are most important to them when it comes to filing their taxes. Those include ease of use, information security, ensuring that returns are prepared correctly, compatibility with mobile devices, and whether such a platform can file both federal and state taxes at the same time</p>
<p>About 70% of Americans are eligible to file electronically using the IRS’s Free File program, but a <a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-22-105236.pdf">GAO report</a> from April 2022 found that only 4 million individuals, or about 4% of all eligible taxpayers, used the program to file their federal tax returns.</p>
<p>The Washington Post <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/08/15/bessent-irs-executives-ousted/">reported last Friday</a> that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who is also serving as acting IRS commissioner, ousted three more IRS executives. Bridget Roberts, who led the agency’s Direct File operation, were among those removed.</p>
<p>An IRS executive recently told Federal News Network that maintaining public services like Direct File should be “mission-critical” for the agency.</p>
<p>“It should be the case that if any government agency produces a product that helps the public interact with them better, that should be required to be maintained, whether it’s politically popular or not, because that is what a government service delivery organization is supposed to do. But that’s not how IRS holds itself accountable,” the executive said.</p>
