<p>WASHINGTON — Labor unions representing millions of educators and school employees are suing President Donald Trump’s administration over <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-immigration-lawsuits-courts-rulings-decisions-03bc555dddeb7245bbd23a0b2d396e07">its immigration crackdown</a> , saying arrests near school campuses are terrorizing children and their teachers, leading some students to drop out.</p>
<p>At the start of Trump’s second term, his Republican administration said it would <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-immigration-ice-raids-school-2d899678264f44fe1021847ee385fd15">allow immigration arrests at schools</a> — long considered off limits. That violated the law, argues the lawsuit from the two largest U.S. teacher unions, the National Education Association and the American Federation of Teachers, which represent more than 4 million school employees nationwide.</p>
