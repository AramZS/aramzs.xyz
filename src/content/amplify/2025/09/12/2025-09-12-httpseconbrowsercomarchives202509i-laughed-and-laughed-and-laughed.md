<blockquote><p>For too long, America has been flying blind on our economic health. The Bureau of Labor Statistics is in desperate need of immediate reform and President Trump is putting the best team in place to do just that.<strong> EJ Antoni, Ph.D., will restore confidence and much needed integrity in the agency tasked with reporting on the state of our nation’s economy.</strong> The Bureau of Labor Statistics, which is most well-known for producing the monthly jobs report, must be the gold standard for labor data and a trusted source for Americans and partners worldwide.</p> <p>One major problem is that BLS jobs and economic reports are frequently revised. …</p></blockquote>
<p>So frequent revisions are a problem. Well, we could be just like China, and report a GDP number *real* fast. And we could stick with the first releases – no changes ever! And we could also remove from prying eyes the source data, like China does. Better yet, let anybody who questions the data be prosecuted for economic spying.</p>
<p>I for one an looking forward to undoing revisions to GDP, so that we go back to expressing it in constant 1987$.</p>
