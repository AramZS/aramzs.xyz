<p>The presiding officers of Maryland’s General Assembly were targeted by bomb threats on Thursday, amid rising concern about political violence in the nation.</p>
<p>House of Delegates Speaker Adrienne A. Jones and Senate President Bill Ferguson, both Democrats, disclosed that they received bomb threats involving their homes.</p>
<p>Jones lives in Baltimore County; Ferguson in Baltimore City.</p>
<p>Jones said in a social media post that the threat was received at her home. “Law enforcement responded quickly and determined that it was a non-credible bomb threat,” she wrote.</p>
<p>Ferguson said the Baltimore Police Department received the bomb threat involving his home.</p>
<p>“Thankfully, everyone is safe and secure,” he wrote.</p>
<p>The threats come one day after conservative personality and provocateur <a href="https://www.thebanner.com/national/charlie-kirk-shot-utah-valley-university-FSCXXJDE5RGG3K6EYVHRGD52SI/">Charlie Kirk</a> was shot and killed during an event at Utah Valley University.</p>
<p>As of early Thursday evening, no suspect or motive had been publicly identified in Kirk’s killing, though many have described it as political violence given his high-profile political work as the founder of Turning Point USA.</p>
<p>Also on Thursday, police investigated <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/national-security/5499107-bomb-threat-dnc-headquarters/">a bomb threat</a> at the Democratic National Committee offices in Washington, D.C., and determined it was not credible. Several historically Black colleges and universities <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/09/11/hbcus-lockdown-threats/86094019007/">also were targeted</a> with threats Thursday.</p>
<p>Many politicians had been on edge since June, when a top Democratic Minnesota state lawmaker and her husband were killed and another Democratic lawmaker and his wife were wounded.</p>
<p>Jones and Ferguson both condemned political violence.</p>
<p>“Somehow and someway, the current momentum of our political culture must move away from dehumanizing our ideological opponents and towards a recognition of our shared experiences in this world together,” Ferguson wrote.</p>
<p>He quoted the 1966 song “For What It’s Worth” by Buffalo Springfield: “There’s battle lines being drawn; And nobody’s right if everybody’s wrong.”</p>
<p>Gov. Wes Moore, also a Democrat, said in a statement that these threats need to be taken seriously.</p>
<p>“I have said it before and will say it again: Violence of any type — including rhetoric and threats — will not be tolerated," he said.</p>
<p>Jones assured her constituents that she would continue to work for them.</p>
<p>“While such threats are violating, we can’t let it distract us from the important work that we do,” Jones wrote. “Tonight, I will take time to care for my family and team and look forward to getting back to work tomorrow.”</p>
