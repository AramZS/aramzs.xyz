title: Blogs don’t need to be so lonely
---
<div><main><p>While clicking through my RSS feeds, I found my way to Jay’s post titled “<a href="https://thehistoryoftheweb.com/do-blogs-need-to-be-so-lonely/">Do blogs need to be so lonely?</a>”. It’s an interesting post, especially interesting for me since I love blogs. Betteridge's law of headlines tells us that the answer to the question Jay is posing is “no”, but I think it’s worth expanding on why I think that’s not the case.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do blogs, like this one I’m writing in now, need to be so lonely? Not always, but sometimes, I feel like I’m shouting into the void. I’m picturing something relatively simple. Something like a group blog, or a blog co-op. A group of internet friends posting together, without too much oversight or coordination between them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, I don’t have anything against the idea of group blogging or a blog co-op, but I don’t think that will address the initial problem Jay’s flagging, that sensation of shouting into a void. I guess shouting into a void with a few friends is better than doing it by yourself, but the end result is still the same. And unless by group blog he means <em>writing</em> posts together and not just <em>posting them</em> on the same site, then I don’t think the situation would change much.</p>
<p>The second part of that quote is the one I find the most interesting and the one I can’t stop smiling at every time I think about it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A group of internet friends posting together, without too much oversight or coordination between them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I can’t stop smiling because we already have this. It’s what people used to call the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blogosphere">blogosphere</a>. There are already potentially millions of people out there, posting together, without much oversight or coordination between them. I have interviewed one hundred and six of them for <a href="https://peopleandblogs.com">People and Blogs</a> (which, btw, is a collaborative blogging project) and there are almost a thousand collected on the <a href="https://blogroll.org">blogroll</a>.</p>
<p>A lot of them I consider internet friends. I follow what they’re up to thanks to their blogs, and I occasionally send them emails, precisely to address the “shouting into the void” nature of blogging. And it’s working wonderfully.</p>
<p>I think we have all the tools we need to address the issue Jay’s flagging in his post. Now we just need to actually do it. I think it comes down to linking more to what other people are writing, posting more replies to other people’s posts, and putting some effort into connecting directly with the author when we stumble on a piece of writing that resonates with us.</p>
<hr/>
<blockquote>
<p>So why not collaborative blogging? Why not groups of people coming together to create personal blogs? Something less formal than a journalist collective, but more communal than a personal blog. Blogging collectively opens us up to a new kind of content, one in which members of the blog are in conversation with one another in a way that’s comfortable and unique.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is already happening; it doesn’t need to be invented. In his piece, Jay quoted <a href="https://www.thisdaysportion.com/posts/blogging-collectively/">Leon’s post</a>. I have now mentioned and linked to both of them in mine. They’ll be free to respond on their blogs if they want to keep the conversation going, and anybody else is welcome to join.</p>
<p>Your blog doesn’t have to be lonely. But at the same time, you can’t expect it not to be that way without effort. So if you care, then put some effort into this. Trust me, it’s worth it.</p></main></div>
