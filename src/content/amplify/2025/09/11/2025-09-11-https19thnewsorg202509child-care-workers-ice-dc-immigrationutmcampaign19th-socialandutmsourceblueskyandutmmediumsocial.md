  In Washington, D.C., where close to 40 percent of child care workers are
  immigrants, fear has taken hold amid a crime crackdown that has raised ICE
  presence. Many are missing work, deepening a staffing shortage in the
  industry.

<p>From her home-based day care in Washington D.C., Alma peers out the door and down the sidewalks. If they’re clear and there are no ICE agents out, she’ll give her coworker, an undocumented Latina who lives nearby, a call letting her know it’s safe to head in for work.</p>
<p>They have to be careful with the kids, too. Typically, she took the five children she cares for to the library on Wednesdays and out to parks throughout the week, but Alma — who is also undocumented — had to stop doing that in August, when President Donald Trump declared a “crime emergency” in the district. Now, two of the kids she cares for are being pulled out of the day care. The parents said it was because they weren’t going outside.</p>
<p>Trump has deployed the National Guard and a wave of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents into the district. ICE arrests there have increased <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/23/politics/dc-crime-immigration-arrests-trump">tenfold</a>. The situation has thrust the Latinas, who hold up the nation’s child care sector, into a perpetual state of panic. Nationwide, about <a href="https://docs.iza.org/dp15821.pdf">1 in 5</a> child care workers are immigrants, but in D.C. it’s closer to <a href="https://cscce.berkeley.edu/publications/blog/nearly-half-a-million-early-childhood-educators-are-immigrants/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">40 percent</a>; about <a href="https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/report/immigrants-america-educational-system/#childcare-daycare">7 percent</a> nationally are undocumented. Nearly all are women.</p>
<p>Many are missing work, and others are risking it because they simply can’t afford to lose pay, providers told The 19th. All are afraid they’ll be next.</p>
<p>“What kind of life is this?” said Alma, whose name The 19th has changed to protect her identity. “We are not delinquents, we are not bad people, we are here to work to support our family.”</p>
<p>Alma has been running a home-based day care for the past decade. She’s been in the United States for 22 years, working in child care that entire time. With two kids being pulled, she will have to reduce her staffer’s hours as she tries to find children to fill those spots.</p>
<p>Her four school-age children also depend on her. This month, she had to write out a signed document detailing what should happen to her kids if she were to be detained. Her wish is that they be brought to detention with her.</p>
<p>“I can’t imagine my kids here without me,” she said.</p>
<p>She said she understands the president’s approach of expelling immigrants with criminal convictions from the country, but teachers who are working with kids? Who haven’t committed any crime?</p>
<p>By targeting them, she said, the administration is “destroying entire families.”</p>
<p>The Multicultural Spanish Speaking Providers Association in D.C., which works with Latina child care providers, has seen this panic first hand for the past couple of weeks as more and more Latinas in child care have stopped coming into work. The center also helps workers obtain their associate’s degree in early childhood education, and since the semester started in mid-August, many teachers have asked for classes to be offered virtually so they don’t have to show up to campus at night.</p>
<p>Latinas have flocked to the child care industry for multiple reasons: Families seeking care value access to language education, and Latinas have a lower language barrier to entry, said Blanca Huezo, the program coordinator at the Multicultural Spanish Speaking Providers Association.</p>
<p>“In general, this industry offers them an opportunity for a fresh start professionally in their own language and without leaving behind their culture,” Huezo said.</p>
<p>Though the number of undocumented child care workers has historically been low, recent changes from the Trump administration to revoke or reduce legal protections have <a href="https://www.clasp.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025_Impact-of-Anti-immigrant-Policies-on-Children-Families-CCEE-Workforce_.pdf">likely increased it</a>. This year, the administration has <a href="https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/5433869-court-reaffirms-ruling-limiting-trump-asylum-ban/">narrowed opportunities for claiming asylum</a> at the border, <a href="https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/5433869-court-reaffirms-ruling-limiting-trump-asylum-ban/">tried to bar certain groups</a> from obtaining Temporary Protected Status and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/05/30/nx-s1-5406775/supreme-court-trump-chnv-program">temporarily paused humanitarian protections</a> for groups of migrants, thrusting more workers into the “undocumented” category.</p>
<p>The changes, coupled with increased enforcement, has fostered fear <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/30/us/latinos-los-angeles-immigration.html">among Latinx people</a> regardless of immigration status. That fear among workers is deepening a staffing crisis in an industry that already couldn’t afford additional losses, Huezo said.</p>
<p>“There is a shortage — and now even more,” she said. “There are many centers where nearly 99 percent of teachers are of Hispanic origin.”</p>
<p>Washington, D.C., has been a sanctuary city since 2020, where law enforcement cooperation with immigration officials was broadly prohibited. Earlier this year, however, Mayor Muriel Bowser proposed repealing that law and, in mid-August, Washington’s Metropolitan Police Department Police Chief Pamela Smith gave officers leeway to <a href="https://go.mpdconline.com/GO/EO_25_005.pdf">share information with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE</a>) about individuals they arrested or stopped.</p>
<p>“There was some peace that living in D.C. brought more security,” Huezo said. Now, “people don’t feel that freedom to walk through the streets.”</p>

<p>Child care centers are also no longer off limits for ICE raids. The centers were previously protected under a “sensitive locations” directive that advised ICE to not conduct enforcement in places like schools and day cares. But Trump removed that protection on his <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-scraps-guidance-limiting-immigration-arrests-near-certain-locations-2025-01-21/">first day in office</a>. While reports have not yet surfaced of raids in day cares, ICE presence near child care care centers, including in D.C., <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/25/washington-dc-daycare-workers-parents-immigration-raids">has been reported</a>.</p>
<p>A similar story of fear and surveillance has <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-06-22/if-ice-comes-knocking-how-child-care-providers-brace-immigration-raids">already played out</a> in Los Angeles, where ICE conducted widespread raids earlier in the summer. Huezo said her organization has been in touch with child care providers in L.A. to learn about how they managed those months.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the best the organization can do, she said, is connect workers with as many resources as possible, including legal clinics, but the ones that help immigrants are at their maximum caseload. The group has put child care workers who are not leaving their homes in touch with an organization called Food Justice DMV that is delivering meals to their doorsteps. Prior to last month, people who needed food could fill out a form and get it that same week. Now, the wait time is two to three weeks, Huezo said. For those in Maryland and Virginia, it’s closer to a month.</p>
<p>Thalia, a teacher at a day care, said her coworkers have stopped coming to work. It’s all the staff talks about during their lunchtime conversations. When she rides the Metro into work, she looks over her shoulder for the ICE agents, their faces covered, who are often at the exits.</p>
<p>“They are hunting us,” she said.</p>
<p>Thalia, whose name has been changed because she is undocumented, has been living in the United States for nine years and working in child care that entire time. Like her, many of the Latina teachers she works with have earned certifications and degrees in early childhood education.</p>
<p>“We are working, we are cooperating, paying taxes,” she said. “We are there all day so other families can benefit from the child care.”</p>
<p>As a single mother, Thalia has also had to consider what would happen to her three children if she was detained. This past month, she retained a lawyer who could help them with their case in case anything were to happen. Her school-age kids know: Call the lawyer if mom is detained and get tickets to Guatemala to meet her there.</p>
<p>This is what she lives with every day now: “The fear of leaving your family and letting them know, ‘If I don’t return, it’s not because I am abandoning you.’”</p>
