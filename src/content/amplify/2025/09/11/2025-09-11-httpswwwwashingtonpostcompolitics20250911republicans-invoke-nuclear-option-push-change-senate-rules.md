<p>The rules change will allow the Senate to confirm multiple people at once, helping to clear a backlog of nearly 150 Trump nominees awaiting floor votes.</p>
<p>Republicans moved Thursday to speed up Senate confirmation of President Donald Trump’s nominees by changing the chamber’s rules over the objections of Democrats.</p>
<p>Senators voted 53-45 to allow themselves to change the rules with a simple majority instead of 60 votes — a move known as the “nuclear option.”</p>
