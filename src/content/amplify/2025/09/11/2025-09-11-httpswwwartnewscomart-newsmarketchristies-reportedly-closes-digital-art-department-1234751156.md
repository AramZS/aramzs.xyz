<p>Christie’s is closing its <a data-tag="digital-art" href="https://www.artnews.com/t/digital-art/">digital art</a> department and has parted ways with Nicole Sales Giles, the auction house’s vice president of digital, <em>Now Media</em> <a href="https://nowmedia.co/posts/christies-shutters-digital-art-department">reported</a> Monday.</p>
<p>Sales Giles confirmed the news to <em>Now Media</em>, while a Christie’s spokesperson told the news site that the company had made “a strategic decision to reformat digital art sales.”</p>
<p>“The company will continue to sell digital art within the larger 20th- and 21st-century art category,” the spokesperson added.</p>

<p>The move comes just over four years after Christie’s staged the record-breaking sale of Beeple’s <em>Everydays: The First 5000 Days</em> (2021) for $69.3 million, which set the record for the highest price achieved for a digital artwork. The auction was also the house’s first NFT sale and is widely credited with igniting the 2021–22 NFT boom.</p>
<p>But 2025 is far removed from that frenzy. In the years since, the NFT market <a href="https://www.artnews.com/art-news/news/majority-nfts-dead-report-1234716174/">has crashed</a> and never recovered. In 2022, Christie’s reported $5.9 million in NFT sales, a<a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/196568/auction-house-christies-nft-sales-fell-96-in-2022?utm_source=chatgpt.com"> 96 percent decline</a> from 2021. And in August 2024, one report found that 95 percent of NFTs were effectively “dead,” with the average owner facing a 44.5 percent loss on their investment.</p>
<p>Last year, Christie’s main rival, Sotheby’s, <a href="https://www.artnews.com/art-news/news/major-staffing-changes-hit-sothebys-phillips-layoffs-1234673955/">laid off </a>at least four staffers from its Metaverse and other NFT divisions, leaving only Michael Bouhanna, vice president and head of digital art and NFTs; presale coordinator Davis Brown; and another staffer.</p>
<p>Christie’s did not respond to a request for comment at press time.</p>
