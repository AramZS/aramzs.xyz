<p>Ammunition found with a weapon linked to Charlie Kirk's fatal shooting was engraved with messages linked to the right-wing influencer's political enemies, according to sources.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/charlie-kirk-shot/card/ammunition-in-kirk-shooting-engraved-with-transgender-antifascist-ideology-sources-pdymd1sXXMSlVRhpvR4b?mod=e2tw">The <em>Wall Street Journal</em> reported</a> that an internal law enforcement bulletin and a person familiar with the <a href="https://www.rawstory.com/st/raw_story_investigates">investigation</a> show that ammunition found in the weapon was engraved with expression of transgender and antifascist ideology.</p>
<p>The .30-caliber hunting rifle was found in some woods near the scene of the shooting at Utah Valley University, and sources said the gun was wrapped in a towel with spent cartridge still in the chamber and three unspent rounds in the magazine.</p>
<p>All of the ammunition found in the older-model rifle was engraved with wording.</p>
<p>The 31-year-old Kirk was shot in the throat moments after <a href="https://www.rawstory.com/charlie-kirk-2673981099/">saying</a> there had been "too many" mass shootings involved trans people in response to a question from an audience member, who then asked the Turning Points USA head how many mass shooters there had been in the U.S. over the past decade.</p>
<p>“Counting or not counting gang violence?” Kirk replied, and seconds later he was struck by a bullet in the neck.</p>
<p>The audience member who asked the question has not yet been identified, and the shooter remains at large.</p>
