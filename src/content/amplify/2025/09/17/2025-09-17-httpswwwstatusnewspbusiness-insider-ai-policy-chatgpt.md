<p>The Axel Springer-owned newsroom is buzzing over new ChatGPT writing guidelines—part of an aggressive A.I. strategy pushed by its German parentco and detailed in a memo obtained by Status.</p>

<p>On Thursday afternoon, <strong>Business Insider </strong>staffers received a long-awaited memo from editor in chief <strong>Jamie Heller</strong>, outlining the <strong>Axel Springer</strong>-owned outlet’s rules for using artificial intelligence. The guidelines had been eagerly anticipated since earlier this summer, when <strong>Mathias Döpfner</strong>, chief of the German publishing giant Axel Springer, <a href="https://www.status.news/p/axel-springer-mathias-dopfner-ai-policy">urged employees</a> at a corporate town hall to weave A.I. into their daily work, but left the specifics to individual publications.</p>
<p>Heller’s note filled the information vacuum, spelling out both restrictions and expectations for staff. “This policy is designed to enable and encourage us to experiment with A.I., a rapidly changing technology, as we continue to pursue the biggest stories about business, tech, innovation, and more for our audience,” she wrote in the memo, obtained by <em>Status</em>.</p>
<p>The guidelines unsurprisingly said that BI journalists can use A.I.—"just like any other tool"—for tasks such as research. And they said staffers "may use approved A.I. tools for specific tasks and enhancements for images and video." But it was, of course, the rules about using <strong>ChatGPT</strong> in writing that caught the attention of most staffers…</p>

<p><strong><em>Trump Sues The Times:</em></strong> <strong>Donald Trump</strong> is once again attempting to weaponize the courts against the press, this time filing an outrageous $15 billion defamation lawsuit against <strong>The New York Times</strong>. The <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.flmd.447437/gov.uscourts.flmd.447437.1.0.pdf">lawsuit</a> filed Monday in U.S. District Court in <strong>Florida</strong> names four journalists, multiple articles, and a book. In the filing, Trump rages that The NYT “maliciously peddled the fact-free narrative” that others like <strong>“The Apprentice” </strong>producer <strong>Mark Burnett</strong> made him famous, insisting instead he was already a “mega-celebrity.” A spokesperson for The Times dismissed the case as “meritless,” and legal experts noted it stands little chance under the high bar for defamation against press. The NYT publisher <strong>A.G. Sulzberger</strong> denounced the lawsuit <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/16/business/media/trump-lawsuit-new-york-times.html?unlocked_article_code=1.mU8.sJ1M.44m0SSYISmcq&amp;smid=url-share">in a memo</a> to staff as “frivolous,” adding that “everyone, regardless of their politics, should be troubled by the growing anti-press campaign led by President Trump and his administration.” Of course, while Trump’s suit is unlikely to succeed legally, his real aim is to intimidate and punish journalists for coverage he doesn’t like.</p>
<ul><li><p>While Trump was filing his suit against<strong> The NYT,</strong> <strong>A.G. Sulzberger</strong> spoke at the<strong> Investigative Reporters and Editors </strong>50th anniversary celebration: "Democracy is in retreat across the world. Aspiring strongmen are undermining the laws, norms, and institutions that are the bedrock of free societies. A primary target of this project is the press—because when journalists are kept from providing independent information to the public, it becomes far easier for those in power to act with impunity."

<p><strong><em>Trump’s Speech Threat:</em></strong> While <strong>Donald Trump</strong> has long claimed to be the defender of “free speech,” he’s now overtly moving to restrict it. On Tuesday, he threatened <strong>ABC’s Jonathan Karl</strong> after attorney general<strong> Pam Bondi </strong>suggested the <strong>Justice Department </strong>would “absolutely target you, go after you, if you are targeting anyone with hate speech.” When Karl asked what he made of that, Trump replied…</p>
