  Similar in taste to my late mother-in-law’s homey Polish apple cake but a bit
  chewier and less sweet, this babka can be served as a dessert or breakfast
  treat It comes from Sarah Amouyal, co-founder and co-owner of Babka Zana, a
  bakery in Paris with a nod to North African and Ashkenazi Jewish baking
  traditions Unlike many other babkas today, it still has the feeling of old
  Europe in its simplicity

<div><div><p>Similar in taste to my late mother-in-law’s homey Polish apple cake but a bit chewier and less sweet, this babka can be served as a dessert or breakfast treat. It comes from Sarah Amouyal, co-founder and co-owner of Babka Zana, a bakery in Paris with a nod to North African and Ashkenazi Jewish baking traditions. Unlike many other babkas today, it still has the feeling of old Europe in its simplicity. Make it for breakfast as I did, in a traditional loaf, or twist it into four smaller round buns to be shared when sipping coffee, as Ms. Amouyal does. What I especially like about this babka recipe is that it can be assembled one day and baked off the next. The cold, long rest in the refrigerator helps the dough rise more slowly, giving it time to develop flavor, while also making the babka easier to work with. Add a half teaspoon or so of cinnamon to the apples if you must.<span> —Joan Nathan</span></p></div></div>
