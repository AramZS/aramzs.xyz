<p>Jimmy Kimmel is the latest late-night host to be pulled from a major network after the comedian made remarks about the assassination of conservative activist <a data-tag="charlie-kirk" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/charlie-kirk/">Charlie Kirk</a>, amid pressure from Donald Trump’s administration.</p>
<p>“<a data-tag="jimmy-kimmel-live" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/jimmy-kimmel-live/">Jimmy Kimmel Live</a> will be pre-empted indefinitely,” an ABC spokesperson told <em>Rolling Stone</em> on Wednesday. The spokesperson did not clarify the reason behind the decision.</p>
<p>The news arrived shortly after Nexstar kicked his late-night show off its U.S. stations.</p>
<p>“Nexstar’s owned and partner television stations affiliated with the ABC Television Network will preempt Jimmy Kimmel Live! for the foreseeable future beginning with tonight’s show,” the <a href="https://www.nexstar.tv/nexstar-abc-affiliates-to-preempt-jimmy-kimmel-live-indefinitely-beginning-tonight/">company said in a statemen</a><a href="https://www.nexstar.tv/nexstar-abc-affiliates-to-preempt-jimmy-kimmel-live-indefinitely-beginning-tonight/">t</a><a href="https://www.nexstar.tv/nexstar-abc-affiliates-to-preempt-jimmy-kimmel-live-indefinitely-beginning-tonight/">.</a> “Nexstar strongly objects to recent comments made by Mr. Kimmel concerning the killing of Charlie Kirk and will replace the show with other programming in its ABC-affiliated markets.”</p>
<p>During Kimmel’s Monday night monologue, the comedian made remarks about the motives of the suspect accused of fatally shooting Kirk last week. “We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it,” Kimmel said on his show.</p>
<p>Earlier on Wednesday, Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr publicly <a href="https://x.com/bulwarkonline/status/1968392506711613526?s=46">called on</a> licensed broadcasters to stop airing Kimmel’s show.</p>
<p>“I think that it’s really sort of past time that a lot of these licensed broadcasters themselves push back on Comcast and Disney and say, ‘Listen, we are going to preempt we are not going to run <em>Kimmel</em> anymore, until you straighten this out because we, we licensed broadcaster, are running the possibility of fines or license revocation from the FCC if we continue to run content that ends up being a pattern of news distortion,’” Carr said Wednesday, speaking with conservative podcaster Benny Johnson.</p>
<p><em>This is a developing story…</em></p>
