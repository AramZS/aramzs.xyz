<p>The Simpsons are coming back to the big screen.</p>
<p>Disney announced Monday that an untitled movie based on the long-running cartoon “The Simpsons” would release in July 2027. This would be the first feature-length movie about the world of Springfield since “The Simpsons Movie” hit theaters in 2007.</p>
<p>A poster for the film revealed that this will be a direct sequel to “The Simpsons Movie,” following up on the cinematic adaptation of Matt Groening’s hit series.</p>

<p>“Homer’s coming back for seconds,” the poster reads, with the character plucking a donut from the poster in a parallel to the first film’s teaser.</p>
<p>“The Simpsons” family of Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa and Maggie have become a staple of the small screen, with the show having just returned for a 37th season Sunday. Groening, James L. Brooks and Sam Simon developed the show, based on a series of shorts that premiered on “The Tracey Ullman Show.” The show currently holds several crowns of American television, including longest-running sitcom, longest-running animated series and longest-running scripted primetime series from the U.S.</p>
<p>The film takes the date of a previously untitled Marvel project slated to release between “Avengers: Doomsday” and “Avengers: Secret Wars.” This Marvel movie has been removed entirely.</p>
<p><em>More to come …</em></p>
