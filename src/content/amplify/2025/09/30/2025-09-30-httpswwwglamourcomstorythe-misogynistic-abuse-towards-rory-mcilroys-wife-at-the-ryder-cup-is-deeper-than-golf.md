  Than Golf

<p>If you need more evidence that our culture is becoming more misogynistic in 2025, just look at Rory McIlroy’s wife’s Ryder Cup experience.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.glamour.com/story/what-exactly-did-rory-mcilroys-wife-do-wrong-at-the-masters">Erica Stoll</a>, who has been married to the Irish golf champion since 2017, has been getting an increasingly hateful torrent of online abuse for more than a year. Now the 38-year-old, who has a five-year-old daughter with McIlroy, is facing the same vitriol in real life.</p>
<p>At the Ryder Cup over the weekend, Stoll was subjected to the following: had a <a data-event-boundary="click" data-event-click='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-in-view='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-include-experiments="true" data-offer-url="https://x.com/dylan_dethier/status/1972374231041081805?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1972377449641157005%7Ctwgr%5Eeacec28ca7049dde2a4d72978f7bdbc20a605a1d%7Ctwcon%5Es2_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.telegraph.co.uk%2Fgolf%2F2025%2F09%2F28%2Fwatch-rory-mcilroy-wife-erica-usa-fan-beer-thrown-ryder-cup%2F" href="https://x.com/dylan_dethier/status/1972374231041081805?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1972377449641157005%7Ctwgr%5Eeacec28ca7049dde2a4d72978f7bdbc20a605a1d%7Ctwcon%5Es2_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.telegraph.co.uk%2Fgolf%2F2025%2F09%2F28%2Fwatch-rory-mcilroy-wife-erica-usa-fan-beer-thrown-ryder-cup%2F">beer</a> thrown at her head, was taunted with barbs about her brief 2024 split from her <a data-event-boundary="click" data-event-click='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-in-view='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-include-experiments="true" data-offer-url="https://sports.yahoo.com/article/watch-rory-mcilroy-wife-hit-182225680.html" href="https://sports.yahoo.com/article/watch-rory-mcilroy-wife-hit-182225680.html">husband</a>, and had to listen to <a data-event-boundary="click" data-event-click='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-in-view='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-include-experiments="true" data-offer-url="https://sports.yahoo.com/article/watch-rory-mcilroy-wife-hit-182225680.html" href="https://sports.yahoo.com/article/watch-rory-mcilroy-wife-hit-182225680.html">fans chant</a> the name of a woman who, some fans online claim without proof, had a relationship with McIlroy at some point around their breakup.</p>
<p>The abuse and taunts were so unrelenting that Stoll was spotted with “tears streaming down <a data-event-boundary="click" data-event-click='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-in-view='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-include-experiments="true" data-offer-url="https://www.belfastlive.co.uk/sport/other-sport/golf/rory-mcilroys-wife-left-tears-32568565" href="https://www.belfastlive.co.uk/sport/other-sport/golf/rory-mcilroys-wife-left-tears-32568565">her face</a>” and was comforted by her husband in front of fans on the green. After the tournament, the golf champion railed against what he called “unacceptable abuse” he and his wife faced.</p>
<p>“Look, I don’t think we should ever accept that in golf,” he <a data-event-boundary="click" data-event-click='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-in-view='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-include-experiments="true" data-offer-url="https://sports.yahoo.com/article/watch-rory-mcilroy-wife-hit-182225680.html" href="https://sports.yahoo.com/article/watch-rory-mcilroy-wife-hit-182225680.html">said at a press conference</a>. “I think golf should be held to a higher standard than what was seen out there this week.”</p>
<p>While some national news outlets in the US have been referring to the fans’ behavior euphemistically, as ”raucous“ or “unruly,” let’s call a spade a spade: The behavior was pure misogynistic abuse, and it’s a growing movement in American culture right now.</p>
<p>Women in the US are facing increasing levels of misogyny from men both online and off, and it’s not hard to see why. Encouraged by a manosphere that’s made patriarchal bullying seem cool and a White House that houses a cabinet made up of men who have <a href="https://www.glamour.com/story/misogyny-is-2025s-biggest-trend">degraded women</a> and rolled back decades of protections for us in the workplace, men have never felt more emboldened to attack us both on and offline, and it’s getting worse.</p>

<p>Women who date or are married to athletes, a.k.a. <a href="https://www.glamour.com/about/wag-week">WAGs</a>, are interestingly serving as a canary in the coal mine for this phenomenon. Sports traditionally are considered male-dominated spaces, where men are both the stars and the main consumers. To some, WAGs are meant to be on the sidelines, simply there to support their partners and be seen and not heard (though many are <a href="https://www.glamour.com/story/welcome-to-wag-world">changing this narrative</a>).</p>
<p>If women do outshine their partner while supporting him, they often face backlash, as has been the case with Taylor Swift. Swift, who is now engaged to Travis Kelce, faced her own wave of misogynistic abuse when the camera focused “too much” on her as she watched Kelce play in the early days of their relationship in 2023. It was apparently lost on the male football fans what a boon Swift’s presence at games was for both the Kansas City Chiefs and the NFL, and the hate got so bad the pop star began frowning and covering her face whenever the camera swung her way.</p>
<p>This all culminated in a <a href="https://www.glamour.com/story/why-taylor-swift-getting-booed-at-the-super-bowl-was-even-more-chilling-than-you-think">shocking display</a> during February’s Super Bowl 2025, when Swift was briefly shown on the Jumbotron in the stadium. As the camera flashed to her, the stadium erupted in boos and heckling, visibly disturbing Swift as she listened to the ire. She’s now been reportedly hiding her entrances into the games.</p>
<p>But the behavior by “fans” at the Ryder Cup this weekend shows how much worse it’s gotten. Stoll, who is not a public figure, gives no interviews, and mostly keeps to herself, and she has been targeted by months of misogynistic rhetoric simply because she and her husband briefly split in 2024. They reconciled a month later, with McIlroy saying in a statement that “thankfully, we have resolved our differences.”</p>
<p>For some, the bump in the couple’s marital road meant, apparently, that Stoll was fair game. During the Masters earlier this year, which McIlroy won, heaps of speculation and innuendo were placed on Stoll, as if she needed to answer for whatever discord occurred between the two of them. Online commenters picked apart her clothes, her facial expressions, and her body language, examining her for any proof she was not a good-enough wife.</p>
<p>But the hate faced by Rory McIlroy’s wife at the Ryder Cup was a big escalation from the online chatter, and it should concern us all. The fact that a woman who has done nothing but support her husband silently from the sidelines is being abused both verbally and physically by men at a sporting event shows how hate against women, both famous and not, is rapidly escalating.</p>
<p>The actions against Stoll are not an isolated incident. They show a cultural shift, one in which men feel emboldened to attack women in public, without shame or consequence. In which a woman is being judged not by her own merits, but by her perceived value as a “good-enough” wife to a powerful man. And in which, it seems, there’s nothing she can do but try to get through it.</p>

<p>“You know, she handled everything this week with class and poise and dignity like she always has,” he said. “I love her, and we’re going to have a good time celebrating tonight.”</p>
<p>It’s lovely that Stoll is strong and can make it through the weekend with her head held high. But she shouldn’t have to. Neither should any woman, but increasingly, we must.</p>
