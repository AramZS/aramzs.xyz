<p>New Jersey’s public television network may be forced to shut down next year after its nonprofit operator and the state’s Public Broadcasting Authority failed to reach a contract agreement, according to <a href="https://www.njpbs.org/njtv-pressroom/2025/09/23/statement-on-termination-of-state-contract-nj-pbs-operations/">a statement</a> released by the network, NJ PBS, on Tuesday.</p>
<p>NJ PBS attributed recent funding cuts to public broadcasting at the state and federal levels as “significant” factors in the possible closure. The contract between the network’s operator, the WNET Group, and the broadcasting authority expires on June 30, 2026, according to the statement.</p>
<p>It was not clear precisely how the funding cuts had led to the contract impasse. Debra Falk, a spokeswoman for NJ PBS, said Wednesday that WNET and the authority had been “too far apart on key aspects of the agreement about term and monetary obligations.”</p>
<p>“WNET is committed to supporting the state through this transition and looks forward to collaborating with New Jersey-based institutions interested in operating a public television network,” Ms. Falk said in the statement on Tuesday, suggesting the network could continue operations past the contract deadline if another operator was found.</p>
<p>The announcement from NJ PBS comes as state and federal funding cuts have targeted public broadcasting organizations across the United States, and as independent news outlets in New Jersey have closed.</p>
<p>The spending plan Gov. Philip D. Murphy, a Democrat, signed this summer slashed funding for NJ PBS to $250,000, down from $1 million in the previous fiscal year. President Trump and congressional Republicans also cut <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/13/us/politics/public-broadcasting-cuts.html">$500 million</a> from public broadcasters around the country.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/01/nyregion/new-jersey-star-ledger-prints-final-edition.html">The Star-Ledger</a>, once New Jersey’s leading newspaper, stopped printing in February, shifting to an online-only news site, as did three <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/30/nyregion/nj-star-ledger-jersey-journal-newspapers.html">affiliated papers</a>: The Times of Trenton, The South Jersey Times and The Hunterdon County Democrat. Another state publication, The Jersey Journal, shut down entirely that month.</p>
<p>Over time, other news outlets, including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/03/nyregion/in-new-jersey-only-a-few-media-watchdogs-are-left.html">The New York Times</a>, have cut back on their coverage of New Jersey.</p>
<p>In August, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/01/business/media/corporation-for-public-broadcasting-shut-down.html">Corporation for Public Broadcasting</a> said that it would shut down next year following federal funding cuts, ending its role as a longtime supporter of NPR, PBS and local radio and TV stations.</p>
<p><a href="https://radio.wpsu.org/2025-09-11/penn-state-plans-close-wpsu-board-committee-rejects-transfer-whyy">WPSU</a>, an NPR and PBS affiliate in Pennsylvania, announced plans to close just a few weeks ago after celebrating its 60th anniversary. The future of public stations in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/13/us/politics/public-broadcasting-cuts.html">tribal areas</a> like <a href="https://kwso.org/about-kwso/">KWSO</a>, owned and operated by the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs in Oregon, have been left in limbo as they search for other revenue sources.</p>

<p>Mr. Murphy’s office refused to comment on the potential closure of NJ PBS, instead referring to remarks the governor made during a February budget address. Responsible budgeting, he suggested then, required “hard decisions,” including “scaling back programs that we would rather increase funding for.”</p>
<p>John Burzichelli and Andrew Zwicker, Democratic state senators from New Jersey, said in a statement that NJ PBS had served as an important source of information in a state with few news outlets, and they called for a review of the network’s finances to find a way to keep it running.</p>
<p>“This is another destabilizing setback to a news sector that has experienced recurring obstacles,” the senators said. “For NJ PBS, the federal government’s decision to cancel funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting was the devastating blow.”</p>
<p>The possible closure of the station comes on the heels of other abrupt changes affecting New Jersey news. In July, Mr. Murphy and lawmakers agreed to stop requiring that legal ads — an important revenue source for many news outlets — appear in print or in online news sites, worsening the already bleak outlook for journalism in one of America’s wealthiest states.</p>
<p>Margaret Sullivan, executive director of the Craig Newmark Center for Journalism Ethics and Security at Columbia, said that the federal cutbacks on public broadcasting were troubling at a time when local journalism was already “weakened and under siege.”</p>
<p>Ms. Sullivan, who served as the public editor of The Times from 2012 to 2016, said that closures of local news outlets could lead to a country that was even more divided.</p>
<p>“People become more disengaged from their communities, and they tend to flee into their tribal corners even more than we have seen,” she said. “It focuses people more on national news, less on local news, and it tends to polarize.”</p>
