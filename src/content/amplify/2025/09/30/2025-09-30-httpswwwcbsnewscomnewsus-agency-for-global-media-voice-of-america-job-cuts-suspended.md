  Judge suspends Trump administration's plan to eliminate hundreds of jobs at
  Voice of America's parent agency
---
<p>A federal judge agreed Monday to <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.279211/gov.uscourts.dcd.279211.164.0.pdf">temporarily suspend</a> the Trump administration's plan to <a data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/voice-of-america-job-cuts-trump-administration-kari-lake/">eliminate hundreds of jobs</a> at the agency that oversees <a data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/voice-of-america-history-60-minutes/">Voice of America</a>, the government-funded broadcaster founded to counter Nazi propaganda during World War II.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth in Washington, D.C., ruled that the U.S. Agency for Global Media cannot implement a reduction in force eliminating 532 jobs for full-time government employees on Tuesday. Those employees represent the vast majority of its remaining staff.</p>
<p>Kari Lake, the agency's acting CEO, <a href="https://x.com/KariLake/status/1961600955343843577">announced in late August</a> that the job cuts would take effect Tuesday. But the judge's ruling preserves the status quo at the agency until he rules on a plaintiffs' underlying motion to block the reduction in force.</p>
<p>Lamberth previously ruled that President Trump's administration <a data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/federal-judge-trump-order-voice-of-america/">must restore VOA programming</a> to levels commensurate with its statutory mandate to "serve as a consistently reliable and authoritative source of news." He also <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.278809/gov.uscourts.dcd.278809.76.0.pdf">blocked Lake</a> from removing Michael Abramowitz as VOA's director.</p>
<p>The judge had also ruled separately that the Trump administration had failed to show how it was complying with his orders to restore VOA's operations.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump signed an executive order in March effectively shutting down the taxpayer-funded broadcaster for what the White House has called "radical propaganda." CBS News reached out to the White House on Monday for comment.</p>
<h2>Judge cites "concerning disrespect" toward the court</h2>
<p>Lamberth accused the administration of showing "concerning disrespect" toward the court in response to his earlier orders to produce information about its plans for Voice of America.</p>
<p>Employees who sued to block the dismantling of VOA claimed the planned cuts would hamper the judge's ability to enforce the injunction he issued in April. "This Court should therefore preserve the status quo while the parties litigate compliance," <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.278809/gov.uscourts.dcd.278809.84.0.pdf">their attorneys wrote</a>.</p>
<p>Government lawyers accused the plaintiffs of impermissibly trying to micromanage the agency's operations. "Enjoining the reductions in force would be a wholly overbroad and improper remedy," <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.278809/gov.uscourts.dcd.278809.92.0.pdf">they wrote</a>.</p>
<p>Lamberth, a senior judge, was nominated to the bench by Republican President Ronald Reagan in 1987.</p>
<h2>Can media agency continue to fulfill its "statutory mission?"</h2>
<p>The U.S. Agency for Global Media also houses Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Radio Free Asia, Middle East Broadcasting Networks and Radio Marti, which beams Spanish-language news into Cuba. The networks, which together reach an estimated 427 million people, date to the Cold War and are part of a network of government-funded organizations trying to extend U.S. influence and combat authoritarianism.</p>
<p>The broadcasters have for decades served to project American values around the world while sharing fact-based news in a variety of languages. With Voice of America falling silent, Republican Rep. Young Kim of California told <a data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/voice-of-america-dismantling-60-minutes/">"60 Minutes"</a> earlier this year that she worries the U.S. is <a data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/voa-cuts-trump-director-michael-abramowitz-interview/">ceding the airwaves</a> to foreign dictators.</p>
<p>"When we are in an information war and we stop broadcasting into those repressive governments and into repressive societies â€¦ they are not going to hear the truth," she said at the time.</p>
<p>Congress appropriated $875 million to the agency for fiscal year 2025 and required that $260 million of the funds must be spent by VOA.</p>
<p>In March, Trump signed an executive order calling for the agency to reduce its "statutory functions and associated personnel to the minimum presence and function required by law." A day later, VOA stopped broadcasting for the first time in 83 years. The agency placed almost all of its full-time employees on administrative leave.</p>
<p>In announcing the job cuts on social media last month, Lake said the agency "will continue to fulfill its statutory mission ... and will likely improve its ability to function."</p>
<p>"I look forward to taking additional steps in the coming months to improve the functioning of a very broken agency and make sure America's voice is heard abroad where it matters most," she wrote.</p>
<p>Plaintiffs' attorney Georgina Yeomans argued Monday that the cuts would cement the agency's programming at deficient levels that don't comply with the judge's orders. Yeomans said it's unclear who at the agency is making key decisions, such as which jobs to eliminate.</p>
<p>"We simply do not know," she said.</p>
