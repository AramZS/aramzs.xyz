title: Spotify’s founder and CEO Daniel Ek is stepping down
---
<p>Music streaming giant Spotify said on Tuesday that its founder, Daniel Ek, is stepping down as CEO and will become the company’s executive chairman by the year’s end.</p>
<p>The company is replacing Ek with two co-CEOs chosen in house: Gustav Söderström, co-president, and chief product and technology officer; and Alex Norström, co-president and chief business officer.</p>
<p>“Over the last few years, I’ve turned over a large part of the day-to-day management and strategic direction of Spotify to Alex and Gustav–who have shaped the company from our earliest days and are now more than ready to guide our next phase,” Ek said in a statement. “This change simply matches titles to how we already operate. In my role as Executive Chairman, I will focus on the long arc of the company and keep the Board and our co-CEOs deeply connected through my engagement.”</p>
<p>In a post on X, Ek also mentioned that Spotify has been profitable for over a year.</p>
