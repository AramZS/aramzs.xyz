<h2 data-gu-name="standfirst">Body says research has found ‘no consistent association’ and urges pregnant women to follow doctors’ advice</h2>
<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) is pushing back against contested claims by the <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> that acetaminophen use during pregnancy heightens the risk of <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/autism">autism</a>, further underscoring that no scientific consensus supports such a connection.</p>
<p>“Extensive research, including large-scale studies over the past decade, has found no consistent association,” the agency said in a Wednesday <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.who.int/news/item/24-09-2025-who-statement-on-autism-related-issues">statement</a>.</p>
<p>“[The] WHO recommends that all women continue to follow advice of their doctors or health workers, who can help assess individual circumstances and recommend necessary medicines.”</p>
<p>The concern had escalated earlier in the week when Donald Trump, alongside senior health officials including Robert F Kennedy Jr, issued a <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/22/trump-administration-autism-causes">warning</a> about acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol, alleging it contributes to rising autism rates. The announcement also included plans for a new study examining potential links between childhood vaccines and autism.</p>
<p>“Taking Tylenol is not good … all pregnant women should talk to their doctors about limiting the use of this medication while pregnant,” Trump said on Monday.</p>
<p>WHO stressed that all medications should be used with caution during pregnancy, especially in the early stages, but pointed out that previous studies raising alarms about acetaminophen were flawed and have since been discredited.</p>
<p>The organization also reaffirmed its stance on vaccines and said that “large, high-quality studies from many countries have all reached the same conclusion” – that vaccines do not cause autism. It emphasized that over the past five decades, global immunization efforts guided by the agency have prevented at least 154 million deaths.</p>
<p>The vaccine schedule “remains essential for the health and wellbeing of every child and every community”, it said.</p>
<p>Autism affects an estimated 62 million people worldwide, or roughly one in 127 individuals. Its precise origins remain unclear, with researchers pointing to a mix of genetic and environmental factors.</p>
<p>Other medical experts have since <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/22/trump-tylenol-experts-autism">raised alarms</a> about the Trump administration’s baseless claims.</p>
<p>The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) released a statement saying “suggestions that acetaminophen use in pregnancy causes autism are not only highly concerning to clinicians but also irresponsible when considering the harmful and confusing message they send to pregnant patients.”</p>
<p>The issue of autism and other neurodevelopmental conditions is expected to be a central focus at the UN high-level <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.who.int/news-room/events/detail/2025/09/25/default-calendar/fourth-high-level-meeting-of-the-un-general-assembly-on-the-prevention-and-control-of-ncds-and-the-promotion-of-mental-health-and-wellbeing-(hlm4)">meeting</a> on mental health and non-communicable diseases scheduled for Thursday.</p>
