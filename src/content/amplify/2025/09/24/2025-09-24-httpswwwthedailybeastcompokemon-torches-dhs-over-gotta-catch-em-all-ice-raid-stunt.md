<p>Pokémon has revealed that the Department of Homeland Security used its branding without permission in its “Gotta Catch ’Em All” ICE raid <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/ice-accused-of-holding-5-year-old-girl-hostage-to-force-father-to-surrender/">deportation campaign</a>.</p>
<p>DHS triggered a culture-war firestorm after <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/nintendo-alerted-after-dhs-uses-pokemon-to-promote-ice-raids-tearing-families-apart/">posting a Pokémon-themed montage of immigration raids</a>—set to the franchise’s famous theme and capped with mock “cards” for arrestees—on Monday.</p>
<p>The stunt includes a video clip from a raid attended by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem where U.S. citizens were cuffed outside a shattered door—footage critics say should never have been turned into content, and <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/ice-barbie-could-be-hit-with-subpoena-after-photo-op-flub-joyce-vance/">could land Noem in legal trouble</a>.</p>

<p>In the <a href="https://x.com/DHSgov/status/1970251208322621530">post on X</a>, DHS captioned the package “Gotta Catch ’Em All,” and Customs and Border Protection even <a href="https://x.com/CBP/status/1970280164442714348">piled on</a> with a gif of a dancing Pikachu, the yellow, mouse-like mascot of the globally popular franchise.</p>
<p>The campaign mirrored the anime’s opening sequence and card-game tropes, right down to listing “weakness” as the ICE emoji and “retreat” as an airplane.</p>

<p>Now the company behind the global kids’ brand is crying foul.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Pokémon Company International told the Daily Beast, “We are aware of a recent video posted by the Department of Homeland Security that includes imagery and language associated with our brand.</p>
<p>“Our company was not involved in the creation or distribution of this content, and permission was not granted for the use of our intellectual property.”</p>
<p>It comes a day after <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/maga-podcaster-tears-into-dhs-for-using-him-to-promote-trumps-deportations/">comedian Theo Von also took umbrage at DHS</a> using one of his self-filmed social media videos to boast about the number of people it had deported.</p>

<p>Fans of the anime cartoon have demanded the Pokémon Company International—of which Nintendo is a major co-owner and platform holder—sue DHS over the flagrant abuse of its intellectual property.</p>

<p>However, Don McGowan, Pokémon’s former chief legal officer, told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fans-want-pokmon-to-sue-after-department-of-homeland-security-video-uses-ash-ketchum-to-promote-ice-but-the-companys-former-legal-boss-says-he-wouldnt-touch-this">the gaming website IGN</a> that he “wouldn’t touch this,” predicting it would “blow over in a couple of days,” citing the company’s aversion to publicity and noting “many of their execs in the USA are on green cards.”</p>
<p>When asked by the Beast whether it intended to take legal action against the Donald Trump administration over the piracy, the Pokémon Company International declined to comment.</p>
<p>At the time of publication, the DHS video remained online.</p>

<p>DHS is beginning to get a reputation for riding roughshod over IP in its attempt to promote its immigration blitz.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Von—who the Trump world credits with helping expand the campaign’s youth reach—blasted the department for splicing his video into the propaganda edit without sign-off.</p>
<p>“Yooo DHS i didnt approve to be used in this. I know you know my address so send a check,” he <a href="https://x.com/TheoVon/status/1970692062090797341">posted on X</a>, later adding, “When it comes to immigration my thoughts and heart are alot more nuanced than this video allows. Bye!”</p>
<p>The <a href="https://x.com/DHSgov/status/1970606702392148004">DHS edit</a> also brags about deportation tallies—“400,000 deported” and “1.6 million” voluntary self-departures—since Trump took office.</p>
<p>In August, DHS christened an Indiana detention facility the “Speedway Slammer,” prompting the Indianapolis Motor Speedway and IndyCar to <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/kristi-noems-latest-detention-camp-in-indiana-dubbed-speedway-slammer-backfires-immediately/">distance themselves from the branding</a> and request their imagery not be used.</p>
