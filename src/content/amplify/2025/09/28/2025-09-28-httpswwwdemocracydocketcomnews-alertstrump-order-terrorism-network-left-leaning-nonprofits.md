<p>President Donald Trump signed a memorandum Thursday directing the federal government to investigate and dismantle “domestic terrorism networks.”</p>
<p>The move appears targeted at left-leaning progressive nonprofit groups, which Trump days ago <a href="https://www.democracydocket.com/news-alerts/trump-vance-kirk-murder-destroy-progressive-groups/">vowed</a> to dismantle, falsely claiming they fund and support political violence and terrorism in the U.S.</p>
<p>The memo directs the FBI’s National Joint Terrorism Task Force, the Department of Justice, the Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to go after “anti-fascist” movements in the U.S.</p>
<p>“This ‘anti-fascist’ lie has become the organizing rallying cry used by domestic terrorists to wage a violent assault against democratic institutions, constitutional rights, and fundamental American liberties,” the memo reads.</p>
<p>Trump signed the memo shortly after the New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/25/us/politics/justice-trump-george-soros-foundation.html">reported</a> that the Department of Justice directed several U.S. attorneys offices across the country to open investigations into the Open Society Foundations, a progressive grant network founded by Democratic megadonor George Soros.</p>
<p>Asked what specific people or organizations the memo seeks to target, Trump named Soros, who Republicans have long claimed without evidence funds violent protests in the U.S.</p>
<p>“Soros is a name certainly that I keep hearing,” Trump said. “I don’t know. Soros is a name that I hear.”</p>
<p>Trump earlier this month <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-radical-left-healing-charlie-kirk-assassination-rcna231032">asserted</a> Soros must be “jailed” because “he’s a bad guy,” while Vice President JD Vance baselessly claimed that Soros and the Open Society Foundations pay “the salaries of terrorist sympathizers” and “promote violence and terrorism.”</p>
<p>The Open Society Foundations in a statement to Democracy Docket said the Trump administration’s “accusations are politically motivated attacks on civil society, meant to silence speech the administration disagrees with and undermine the First Amendment right to free speech.</p>
<p>“When power is abused to take away the rights of some people, it puts the rights of all people at risk,” it added.</p>
<p>“The Open Society Foundations unequivocally condemn terrorism and do not fund terrorism. Our activities are peaceful and lawful, and our grantees are expected to abide by human rights principles and comply with the law.”</p>
<p>“Our work in the United States is solely dedicated to strengthening democracy and upholding constitutional freedoms. We stand by the work we do to improve lives in the United States and across the world.”</p>
<p>Trump also named LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, one of the largest donors to the Democratic Party. Hoffman founded the Aphorism Foundation, a California-based private grantmaking group that focuses on noncontroversial causes such as supporting universities and hospitals.</p>
<p>Through a separate nonprofit, Hoffman <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/13/nyregion/trump-carroll-lawsuit-hoffman-linkedin.html">provided financial</a> support for writer E. Jean Carroll’s sexual assault lawsuit against Trump.</p>
<p>In terms of specific actions, Thursday’s memo ordered the commissioner of the IRS “to ensure that no tax-exempt entities are directly or indirectly financing political violence or domestic terrorism.”</p>
<p>“In addition, where applicable, the Commissioner shall ensure that the [IRS] refers such organizations, and the employees and officers of such organizations, to the Department of Justice for investigation and possible prosecution,” the memo reads.</p>
<p>Since returning to the White House, Trump has repeatedly threatened to strip left-leaning organizations of their tax exemptions.</p>
<p>Federal law bars senior executive branch officials from directing the IRS, which is currently headed by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent in an acting capacity, to audit any taxpayer or nonprofit organization.</p>
<p>However, the Trump administration could create pretext triggering an IRS audit through several different means.</p>
<p>The White House has repeatedly attempted to link the recent murder of conservative activist Charlie Kirk to progressive causes and groups. The effort has heightened fears that Trump and his allies seek to exploit the killing to further attack institutions that power the political left.</p>
<p>The Trump administration has also specifically targeted the Ford Foundation, another progressive philanthropic organization.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Trump <a href="https://www.democracydocket.com/news-alerts/trump-antifa-domestic-terrorist-organization-executive-order/">sig</a><a href="https://www.democracydocket.com/news-alerts/trump-antifa-domestic-terrorist-organization-executive-order/">n</a><a href="https://www.democracydocket.com/news-alerts/trump-antifa-domestic-terrorist-organization-executive-order/">ed</a> a separate memo claiming to designate “antifa,” a leaderless and decentralized anti-fascist movement, as a “domestic terrorist organization.”</p>
<p>Trump and many of his fellow Republicans have long used antifa as a catch-all designation against protests or speech they disapprove of.</p>
<p>Senior White House officials Thursday claimed that large-scale nationwide protests in recent years, such as the Black Lives Matter protests in 2020, were organized by unspecified organizations and amounted to terrorism.</p>
<p>“This is the first time in American history that there is an all-of-government effort to dismantle left-wing terrorism, to dismantle antifa, to dismantle the organizations that have been carrying out these acts of political violence and terrorism,” Stephen Miller, Trump’s homeland security advisor, said as the president signed the memo.</p>
<p>“Whether it be going back to the riots that started with Black Lives Matter and all the way through to the antifa riots, the attacks on [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] officers, the doxing campaign and now the political assassinations, these are not lone isolated events,” Miller added. “This is part of an organized campaign of radical left terrorism.”</p>
<p>Miller recently referred to the Democratic Party as “not a political party. It is a domestic extremist organization.”</p>
