  At least 2 killed, 8 injured in shooting at Michigan church; suspect dead,
  police say
---
<p>At least two people are dead after a shooter opened fire at a church in Michigan during a Sunday morning worship service. Eight other victims have been hospitalized, according to police.</p>
<p>Worshippers were gathered at the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on McCandlish Road in Grand Blanc Township around 10:25 a.m., Grand Blanc Township Police Chief William Renye said. That's when the suspect, identified as a 40-year-old Thomas Jacob Sanford of Burton, Michigan, drove his vehicle through the front doors of the church, exited his vehicle and fired "several rounds" of an assault rifle at hundreds of churchgoers, Renye said at a news conference.</p>
<p>Ten people with gunshot wounds were taken to the hospital, where two victims were pronounced dead. Renye said at an update Sunday afternoon that one victim is in critical condition and seven others were in stable condition.</p>
<p>According to investigators, the suspect deliberately started a fire at the church at some point, though it's not yet known how the fire was started. Crews have since contained the blaze, but more victims are expected, Renye said.</p>

<p>Police said Sanford died after responding officers "engaged in gunfire" with him. Law enforcement officials are expected to hold another news conference at 8 p.m. You can watch it at the video player above.</p>
<p>Officials have set up an on-site reunification site at a movie theatre on Trillium Circle Avenue. Anyone who needs to connect with someone who was at the church is asked to call the American Red Cross at 248-705-7352.</p>
<p>"This is a dynamic scene," Genesee County Sheriff Christopher Swanson said in a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/geneseecountysheriffsoffice/videos/24584079447909738">video recorded at the scene</a>. "The time where we are right now, there's going to be more updates. Just know that there's a lot of things that are happening that we are not able to communicate just because of the work that needs to be done."</p>
<p>Swanson said there is no active threat to the community.</p>
<p>The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints said in a written statement that it's been in communication with law enforcement and that it's thankful for the emergency responders who are helping the victims and their families.</p>
<p>"We are deeply grateful for the outpouring of prayers and concern from so many people around the world," the statement said. "In moments of sorrow and uncertainty, we find strength and comfort through our faith in Jesus Christ. <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/welcome?lang=eng">Places of worship</a> are meant to be sanctuaries of peacemaking, prayer and connection. We pray for peace and healing for all involved."</p>
<h2>Officials react to Michigan church shooting</h2>
<p>Gov. Gretchen Whitmer posted a written statement on social media that said, "My heart is breaking for the Grand Blanc community. Violence anywhere, especially in a place of worship, is unacceptable. I am grateful to the first responders who took action quickly. We will continue to monitor this situation and hold the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Grand Blanc close."</p>
<p>Grand Blanc Township police said at least 100 Federal Bureau of Investigation agents are responding to the shooting. FBI Director Kash Patel <a href="https://x.com/FBIDirectorKash/status/1972335288887198000">said on X</a> that the agency is tracking reports of the shooting and that agents are at the scene to assist local authorities.</p>
<p>"Violence in a place of worship is a cowardly and criminal act. Our prayers are with the victims and their families during this terrible tragedy," Patel said.</p>
<p>U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said she has received briefings about the incident.</p>
<p>"Such violence at a place of worship is heartbreaking and chilling. Please join me in praying for the victims of this terrible tragedy," Bondi said.</p>
<p>President Trump also said that he has been briefed on the shooting.</p>
<p>"The suspect is dead, but there is still a lot to learn. This appears to be yet another targeted attack on Christians in the United States of America. The Trump Administration will keep the Public posted, as we always do. In the meantime, PRAY for the victims, and their families. THIS EPIDEMIC OF VIOLENCE IN OUR COUNTRY MUST END, IMMEDIATELY," Mr. Trump said in a <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115283020712432544">Truth Social post</a>.</p>
<p>According to Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, her agency is in communication with "interagency partners."</p>
<p>Noem added in a <a href="https://x.com/Sec_Noem/status/1972364343145603283">social media post on X</a> that, "Sacred places of worship should never fear violence in America. I am praying for the victims of this heinous attack and their families."</p>
<p>The New York Police Department said early Sunday afternoon that it was deploying "additional resources to religious institutions across the city," in response to the shooting.</p>
<p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said Sunday that out of an abundance of caution, the Los Angeles Police Department will be increasing patrols at places of worship across the city.</p>
<p>The Grand Blanc Township Police Department said it will have counselors at its facility starting on Monday and through the rest of the week.</p>
