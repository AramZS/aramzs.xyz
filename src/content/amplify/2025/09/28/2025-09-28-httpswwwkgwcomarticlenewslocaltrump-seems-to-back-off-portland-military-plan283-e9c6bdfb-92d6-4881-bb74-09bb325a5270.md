<p>PORTLAND, Ore. — President Donald Trump appears to be cooling on <a href="https://www.kgw.com/article/news/local/trump-says-hell-send-troops-to-portland-oregon/507-c709d69f-8eb1-46a1-8c28-f2a1944f19b0">his plans to send troops to Portland</a> to protect U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities, according to an interview Sunday morning with NBC.</p>
<p>When asked whether he is still sending troops to Portland, which he described as "War ravaged" in a social media post Saturday, Trump said his administration will make a decision on that 'pretty soon.'</p>
<p>"Well, I mean, we're certainly looking at it," Trump said. "You can't have that. We don't want that. They're attacking our ICE facility and they're attacking other federal buildings."</p>
<p>Trump made the comments during a Sunday morning phone interview with NBC White House Correspondent Yamiche Alcindor.</p>
<p>Trump referenced a <a href="https://www.kgw.com/article/news/local/oregon-governor-kotek-call-with-trump-federal-troops/283-48d97859-cc2d-4a6e-a58c-c4c4ef0e7e4f">weekend conversation with Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek</a>, and he alluded to being told by Kotek that the reality in Portland is different from what's being portrayed to him.</p>
<p>"I spoke to the governor, she was very nice," Trump said. "But I said, 'Well wait a minute, am I watching things on television that are different from what's happening? My people tell me different.' They are literally attacking and there are fires all over the place...it looks like terrible."</p>
<p>Kotek said she told Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Saturday morning that troops are not needed, and she believes Trump does not have the authority to deploy the military to Portland.</p>
<p>"We can manage our own local public safety needs," Kotek said. "There is no insurrection, there is no threat to national security."</p>
<p>Portland Mayor Keith Wilson said the 'necessary' number of troops needed that Trump referred to in his social media post is "zero."</p>
<p>"This is an American city, we do not need any intervention,” Wilson said at a Saturday news conference. “This is not a military target.”</p>
<p>Still, in his interview Sunday with NBC, Trump referred to his yearslong perception of Portland as justification for his recent statements.</p>
<p>"They are attacking our ICE and federal buildings all the time," Trump said. "You know, this has been going on for a long time. This has been going on for years in Portland. It’s like a hotbed of insurrection."</p>
<p>As of Saturday, a spokesperson for the Oregon National Guard, Lt. Col. Stephen Bomar, said in an email that “no official requests have been received at this time” for Guard support. "Any requests would need to be coordinated through the Governor’s office," he added.</p>
<p>A Pentagon spokesperson said the Department of Defense would provide information and updates when available.</p>
<p>Since June 2025, more than two dozen people have been arrested in connection with protests outside Portland's ICE building on the south waterfront.</p>
<p>Most of the arrests occurred in the first month. The protests have generally decreased in size over time with reduced levels of confrontation, and law enforcement has maintained a watchful security presence at the building.</p>
<p>Of the criminal cases, most are still ongoing. Three individuals pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges of 'failure to obey a lawful order' and received 6 months of probation and fines. Another case was dismissed by federal prosecutors.</p>
<p>Others facing more serious charges, including felony offenses for assaulting federal officers, are set for trial later this year or in early 2026. Most of the arrests have led to misdemeanor charges, per a KGW analysis of court records.</p>
