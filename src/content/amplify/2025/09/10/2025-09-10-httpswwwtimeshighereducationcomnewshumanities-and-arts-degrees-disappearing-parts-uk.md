<p>Cuts to degree subjects across the UK are preventing thousands of young people studying social sciences, humanities or arts in their region, new analysis has found.</p>
<p>As <a data-module="breaking_news-body" data-mz="" data-position="body" href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/student-choice-risk-almost-half-universities-cut-courses">universities close courses and departments</a> in response to financial pressures, the British Academy has warned that students in parts of the North, South West and East of England, as well as large areas of Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, are losing access to social sciences, humanities and arts (SHAPE) courses.</p>
<p>Analysis found that large parts of the UK – often rural, coastal or historically underserved regions – are already “cold spots” for provision in many of these subjects, with none offered within a commutable distance of 60 kilometres or less, despite the fact that more students than ever are now studying close to home.</p>
<p><a data-module="breaking_news-body" data-mz="" data-position="body" href="https://www.thebritishacademy.ac.uk/policy-and-research/british-academy-shape-observatory/cold-spots-mapping-inequality-in-shape-provision/">The academy’s latest report</a> notes that cuts in these subject areas are particularly pronounced within institutions that require lower grades – often those catering to students from disadvantaged backgrounds.</p>
<p>“Decisions to cut courses are often a reaction to short-term projections of student demand, with quick fixes coming at the cost of strategic vision and longer-term viability,” the report warns.</p>
<p>“But leaving what is taught in our universities solely up to market forces undermines resilient subject provision and economic strategy, with lasting consequences for students and for universities’ ability to serve a public good.”</p>

<p>Provision in modern foreign languages has nearly halved since 2011-12, while studies in linguistics, anthropology, classics, and theology are vulnerable “in many UK regions”, the report says.</p>
<p>More SHAPE subjects – including English, history and drama – are at risk if trends continue, it adds.</p>
<p>“These cold spots have far-reaching consequences, limiting opportunities for students, weakening pipelines into teaching, research and key growth sectors, damaging local and national economies, and eroding the UK’s global reputation for academic excellence,” the report notes.</p>
<p>Sarah Cowan, head of policy at the British Academy, said debates in recent years about the “value of studying social sciences and humanities” were partially to blame for these declines, as well as the growing financial pressures on universities.</p>
<p>When institutions are forced to “make really difficult decisions about their own future and sustainability, the obvious choice to make is to look at degrees which perhaps have falling numbers or…are under attack in the press,” she said.</p>
<p>However, she continued, research suggests SHAPE graduates have similar levels of career success to science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) graduates, while the sectors highlighted in the government’s Industrial Strategy “have really high proportions of SHAPE graduates in their employment”.</p>
<p>The report calls on regulators to monitor subject-level provision more closely through an “at risk” regional subject register and “at risk” subject premium.</p>
<p>It also urges the government to issue “clear guidance” on competition laws to enable better collaboration between institutions – something that could emerge in Labour’s <a data-module="breaking_news-body" data-mz="" data-position="body" href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/dont-expect-funding-reform-plan-skills-white-paper-v-cs-told">upcoming post-16 skills White Paper</a>.</p>
<p>ADVERTISEMENT</p>
<p>The British Academy has called for a full review of the higher education funding system, warning that, without a sustainable system, SHAPE cold spots will deepen and other subjects will be further affected.</p>
<p>“I think one of the worst things that we could end up with is [a] piecemeal sticking plaster approach,” such as increasing fees slightly, Cowan said. “It either stops things from getting worse without fixing them, or it just pushes the issue further down.”</p>
