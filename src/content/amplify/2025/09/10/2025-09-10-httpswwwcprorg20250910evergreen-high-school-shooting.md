<p>A shooting at Evergreen High School this afternoon has left three students critically injured.</p>
<p>The Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office <a href="https://x.com/jeffcosheriffco/status/1965856366536614235">says at least two students were shot</a> at the school in the noon hour. The two and a third student, the suspected shooter, are being treated at CommonSpirit St. Anthony Hospital in Lakewood. All three are in critical condition. Officials say a fourth student was also transported to the hospital, but it is unclear what injury they had. The hospital’s CEO, Kevin Cullinan, said all three patients are teenagers.</p>
<p>"This is the scariest thing you could ever think could happen," said Jacki Kelley, public information officer with Jefferson County Sheriff's Office, at a press conference Wednesday afternoon. “Honestly, I don't know if our suspect is old enough to even drive.”</p>
