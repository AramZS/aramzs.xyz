<p>Not too long ago, the internet was a place you visited. The family desktop sat in its designated closet or back office. In schools, there were rooms filled with computers blinking in tandem, waiting for your class to arrive and hop online. You had to purposefully arrive at the internet, and when done, you left it behind until next time. Now the internet pervades our everyday lives. We have eliminated the doorway, the conscientious effort, needed to access the internet. Always on, always watching, the internet is no longer a place to arrive at and explore but instead a panopticon-like enivronment that we are trapped within. Where the early internet once required intention, place, and presence, today it saturates daily life in ways that erode our capacity for rootedness, attention, and freedom; to recover a healthier digital culture, we must reimagine the internet not as an omnipresent miasma of distraction and surveillance but as a place we choose to enter—and leave—on human terms.</p>
<p>In the 1990s and 2000s, the internet was a deeply physical thing, a location. One “arrived” at the internet with purpose and intention. It was an embodied experience. You clicked and typed, and in the early days often coded via html, your own way through the web. The sense of exploring a physical world was embodied in the way that even website interfaces encouraged breaks in attention, you came to the actual bottom of a page of text rather than scrolling through infinitely, and then you had to make the decision to click forwards, backwards, or leave the page altogether, not unlike flipping through a book.</p>
<p>There was no algorithm, no feed. Instead, on popular web hosting sites like <a href="https://thehistoryoftheweb.com/an-ode-to-geocities/">GeoCities</a>, there were “neighborhoods,” wherein the platform and the personal websites it hosted were divided into virtual groups like “Hollywood” for pop culture sites or “Area51” for alien and science fiction pages, allowing users to find websites other users had created based on their interests. There was a sense of locality because of this. Even the language of the old web—homepage, computer room, web<em>site</em>—connotes a deep sense of location and place. Once done in the neighborhoods, and done online, disconnection was natural, inevitable, and even restful. You purposefully logged out, shut down the computer, and left its designated spot. It did not follow you and was instead waiting until your next visit.</p>
<p>This experience of the internet, of “Web 1.0,” is sadly gone. It went slowly at first, Facebook and MySpace became new booming platforms, Yahoo! acquired GeoCities and did away with the concept of “neighborhoods” before shutting the platform down entirely, and, in perhaps the biggest development of all, the “<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/lexicon-scroll-doomscrolling-mindfulness-linguistics/#:~:text=The%20dawn%20of%20the%20infinite,held%20open%20for%20the%20deluge.">infinite scroll</a>” began structuring the internet in 2006. Now the internet is no longer a neighborhood to be visited and explored and left behind. Today the internet has expanded to our pockets and hands, watches and glasses, refrigerators and doorbells and speakers.</p>
<p>The internet is now a panopticon, wherein users are both watched and watching with no true exit. We have lost the doorway to the computer room and, with it, the distinction between private and public boundaries. Under surveillance capitalism, algorithms are always tracking, nudging, and shaping the behavior of users to scroll and interact as much as possible. The freedom and exploration of the internet is no more. This has resulted in fractured attention, anxiety, and sadly, a diminished sense of place and belonging even with the connectivity the internet could offer.</p>
<p>Where once the internet had clear thresholds of arrival and departure, today it offers no such rhythms. There is no doorway to pass through, no sense of beginning or end. Instead, we find ourselves caught in a stream without banks, pulled along by an attention economy that frays our ability to focus, to think deeply, or even to be fully present with those around us. The internet dissolves the difference between “here” and “elsewhere,” collapsing place into a single, endless everywhere. And in this condition of perpetual connection, what looks like freedom often masks a subtler dependence—our choices shaped, nudged, and constrained by forces we neither see nor control.</p>
<p>A healthier digital culture will require the reintroduction of boundaries and thresholds, a reclaiming of the doorway that once framed our entry into the online world. We can begin with simple practices: confining devices to designated rooms, choosing intentional moments to log in, keeping sabbaths from screens. Such acts remind us that the internet is a tool to be entered on human terms, not a condition of existence. But recovery will demand more than discipline; it will require the counterweight of embodied community and locality, the kinds of rooted ties that resist being flattened into the everywhere of the web. And finally, it will call upon our cultural imagination to picture the internet not as an omnipresent infrastructure humming endlessly in the background of our lives but as a neighborhood—a place we may visit, explore, and leave, on terms that honor human attention, freedom, and rootedness.</p>
<p>Not too long ago, the computer room stood as a threshold, a doorway into another world that waited patiently for our return. In remembering that doorway, we recover more than nostalgia; we recover a vision of what it means to return the internet to its proper bounds. The work before us is not to abandon digital life altogether but to give it limits, to render it once again something we visit rather than something that consumes us. If we can imagine and practice such boundaries, the internet may yet be a place to explore rather than a tower of surveillance, a neighborhood among neighborhoods rather than the endless everywhere. And in reclaiming that doorway, we may also reclaim our attention, our rootedness, and the freedom to dwell more fully in the places that are ours.</p>
