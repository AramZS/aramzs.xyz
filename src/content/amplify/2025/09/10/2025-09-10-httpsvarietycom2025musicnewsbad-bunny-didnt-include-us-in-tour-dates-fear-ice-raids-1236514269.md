<p><a href="https://variety.com/2025/music/news/bad-bunny-puerto-rico-concerts-world-tour-1236434112/">Bad Bunny has elaborated</a> on why he didn’t include the United States in his 2025-26 tour dates, explaining that part of the reason was out of concern over ICE raids.</p>
<p>The musician opened up to <a href="https://i-d.co/article/bad-bunny-puerto-rico-residency-issue-375-cover/">I-D</a> about his decision to leave the U.S. off the itinerary of his upcoming Debi Tirar Mas Fotos World Tour, explaining that he did so for fear that ICE “could be outside [my concert].”</p>
<p>“There were many reasons why I didn’t show up in the US, and none of them were out of hate—I’ve performed there many times,” he said. “All of [the shows] have been successful. All of them have been magnificent. I’ve enjoyed connecting with Latinos who have been living in the US. But specifically, for a residency here in Puerto Rico, when we are an unincorporated territory of the US…</p>
<p>“People from the US could come here to see the show,” he continued. “Latinos and Puerto Ricans of the United States could also travel here, or to any part of the world. But there was the issue of—like, fucking ICE could be outside [my concert]. And it’s something that we were talking about and very concerned about.”</p>
<p><a data-tag="bad-bunny" href="https://variety.com/t/bad-bunny/">Bad Bunny</a> previously sparked conversation about skirting the U.S. during his <em>Variety</em> cover story in June, stating that performances in the country were “unnecessary.” He explained that fans in the U.S. have had no shortage of opportunities to see him perform over the past six years.</p>
<p>The Puerto Rico native has been vocal about ICE over the past few months, <a href="https://variety.com/2025/music/news/bad-bunny-calls-out-ice-video-puerto-rico-raids-1236434813/">sharing footage</a> of an ICE arrest on social media in June that appeared to show agents detaining people in the street. “Look, those motherfuckers are in these cars, RAV-4s,” he said in the clip. “They’re here in Pontezuela. Sons of bitches, instead of leaving the people alone and working there.”</p>
