<h2 data-gu-name="standfirst">President and convicted sex offender appear in birthday scrapbook photo with check signed by ‘DJ Trump’ </h2>
<p>A scrapbook for <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeffrey-epstein">Jeffrey Epstein’s</a> 50th birthday released on Monday contains a photo of him holding a novelty check signed by <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> with the suggestion that Epstein “sold” him a woman for $22,500, shedding further light on the<a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/18/trump-epstein-friendship"> longtime relationship</a> between the president and the convicted sex offender.</p>
<p>The photo shows Epstein and Joel Pashcow, a longtime member of Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort, and a third figure, apparently a woman, whose face is redacted. They are holding a novelty check over a handwritten caption, apparently from Paschow, reading: “Jeffrey showing early talents with money + women! Sells ‘fully depreciated’ [redaction] to <a data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> for $22,500.”</p>
<p>Epstein “showed early ‘people skills’ too”, the caption continued. “Even though I handled the deal I didn’t get any of the money on the girl!”</p>
<p>The check is signed “DJ Trump” in a style that differs from most of his signatures at the time.</p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.wsj.com/us-news/law/epstein-birthday-book-congress-9d79ab34?gaa_at=eafs">reported</a> that the woman was someone with whom Epstein and the now two-time US president “socialized with” in the 1990s.</p>
<p>House oversight committee <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/democrats">Democrats</a> began <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/08/trump-epstein-birthday-letter">publishing details</a> from Epstein’s so-called birthday book on Monday, as the <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> has faced bipartisan criticism for its handling of files pertaining to the disgraced financier.</p>
<p>While campaigning for president in 2024 Trump pledged to release a full list of Epstein’s clients, but after he took office in January the justice department declared no such list exists. Trump has since taken to referring to the ongoing bipartisan furore over Epstein as a Democratic “hoax”.</p>
<p>The book was apparently compiled by Epstein’s associate <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ghislaine-maxwell">Ghislaine Maxwell</a>, who was convicted of sex trafficking and sentenced to 20 years in prison in 2022.</p>
<p>Trump and Epstein were longtime friends who had a falling out in 2004. In July, Trump told reporters that he and Epstein became estranged because the latter “stole” workers from the Mar-a-Lago spa. One of those workers was Virginia Giuffre, who was later abused by Epstein.</p>
<p>Epstein pleaded guilty in 2008 to soliciting prostitution from a minor and died in 2019 in jail while awaiting trial on federal sex-trafficking charges.</p>

<p>Trump has been repeatedly linked to conduct demeaning women. In 2016 he was <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/07/donald-trump-leaked-recording-women">recorded</a> saying his fame enabled him to “do anything” to women and he could “grab ‘em by the pussy”, and he has been accused of sexual harassment by dozens of women, while denying all claims.</p>
<p>In 2023 and 2024, civil jurors found Trump liable for sexually abusing the writer <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/e-jean-carroll">E Jean Carroll</a> in the 1990s and later defaming her.
