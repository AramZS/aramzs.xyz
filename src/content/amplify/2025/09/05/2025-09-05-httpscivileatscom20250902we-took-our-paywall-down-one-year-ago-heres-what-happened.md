title: We Took Our Paywall Down One Year Ago. Here’s What Happened.

<p>A year ago, we <a href="https://civileats.com/2024/09/03/our-reporting-is-now-free-for-everyone/">removed our paywall</a> after nine years. It was a big deal for our small nonprofit newsroom, and something remarkable happened: Our overall traffic shot up, we gained new members, and we are now delivering our vital reporting to more readers than ever.</p>

<p>The Tracker has also followed emerging Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) developments, including the release of a report about <a href="https://civileats.com/2025/05/22/maha-report-focuses-on-ultra-processed-foods-goes-light-on-pesticide-risks/">childhood chronic disease and obesity</a>, a push to get companies to <a href="https://civileats.com/2025/04/22/fda-plans-to-eliminate-artificial-food-dyes-by-end-of-2026/">remove artificial food dyes</a> from their products, and a proposal to <a href="https://civileats.com/food-policy-tracker/#federal-agencies-will-create-an-official-definition-of-ultra-processed-foods">define ultra-processed foods</a>.</p>
<p>With immigration playing an outsize role in the nation’s food system, the Tracker is keeping close tabs on changes to the <a href="https://civileats.com/food-policy-tracker/#department-of-labor-suspends-protections-for-h-2a-guest-workers-and-announces-plan-to-bring-in-more">H-2A Guest Worker program</a> and hosts an up-to-date list of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement <a href="https://civileats.com/food-policy-tracker/#federal-agents-detain-workers-at-a-vermont-dairy-farm">raids</a> on farms and other food businesses.</p>
<p>The Tracker was <a href="https://news.inn.org/in-the-field-and-in-the-know-inn-newsrooms-track-federal-fallout/">featured</a> by the Institute for Nonprofit News (INN), and we recently hosted a behind-the-scenes <a href="https://civileats.com/2025/06/26/inside-the-food-policy-tracker/">online salon</a>, moderated by INN’s Paulina Velasco, to discuss the Tracker, which well over 100 people attended. Readers can also <a href="https://civileats.com/food-policy-tracker/">sign up</a> to receive instant updates or the weekly digest.</p>
<p>With our paywall now down, we can reach a much wider audience and keep them informed about critical issues and events. This is particularly valuable at a time when so much is being obfuscated and mainstream media is beholden to corporate interests.</p>
<p>Having the paywall down has been key to the Food Policy Tracker’s success: It has received more than 116,000 pageviews since it launched and has consistently been one of our website’s top traffic generators and social shares since then.</p>
<p>Having the paywall down has been key to the success of our Food Policy Tracker: it has received more than 116,000 pageviews since it launched in January and has consistently been one of our website’s top traffic generators and social shares since then.</p>
<p>We continue to build on the Tracker and launched a daily and weekly <a href="https://civileats.com/newsletters">newsletter</a>, which keep readers up-to-date on the latest policy news, and have thousands of readers subscribed already.</p>
<p>The Tracker has been extremely well received—we’ve gotten positive feedback from readers and experts from around the country, and we receive a steady stream of tips about how individuals are being affected by the funding freeze and purge of staff across the government.</p>
<p>We’ve heard from sources and readers that the Tracker is a “lifeline for nonprofits preparing for increased need and fighting to maintain services,” is “life-saving,” and is an “essential resource.”</p>
<p>While many newsrooms and commentators still <a href="https://localnewsinitiative.northwestern.edu/posts/2021/03/09/paywalls/">believe</a> “paywalls are the only way [news outlets] are going to survive,” others are <a href="https://mediaengagement.org/research/the-ethics-of-news-paywalls/">calling into question the ethics of news paywalls</a> (see “<a href="https://www.poynter.org/commentary/2022/all-news-election-articles-should-be-free/">Democracy dies behind a paywall</a>”) while also highlighting the <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/159876/liberals-losing-journalism-wars-brian-timpone">number of conservative outlets</a> that make their content free of charge.</p>
<p>Paywalls limit access to information. Meanwhile, high-quality, factual journalism is increasingly held behind these financial gates—and read by fewer and fewer readers.</p>
<p>A year out, we know this for certain–removing our paywall has allowed us to offer an entirely new accountability project, with more people than ever benefiting from our reporting.</p>
<p>Civil Eats’ core mission is to educate and inform, and we believe that making our content accessible to as many people as possible is central to that goal. We also deeply hold that independent media remains a cornerstone of our democracy.</p>
<p>In our small but mighty way, we strive to be part of that tradition, through rigorous reporting that reveals threats to democracy in our food system and sheds light on solutions.</p>
<p><i>Support for our continued paywall removal comes from GRACE Communications, the 11th Hour Project, and Wildseeds Fund. We continue to encourage our readers to </i><a href="https://civileats.com/about/donate/"><i>become supporters</i></a><i> to gain deeper access to our work, join a community of like-minded changemakers and food innovators, and help us keep our reporting free and accessible to all–which is needed now more than ever.</i></p>
