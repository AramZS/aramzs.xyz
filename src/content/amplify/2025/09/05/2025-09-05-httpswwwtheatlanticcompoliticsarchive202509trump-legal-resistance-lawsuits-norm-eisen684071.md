Norm Eisen, a former attorney for Barack Obama’s White House, had convened lawyers, Democratic communications strategists, a neoconservative Trump critic, and a former chair of the Michigan Democratic Party. This one was big, Eisen said from his parked car in Baltimore, where he had traveled for a lawsuit to overturn President Donald Trump’s cuts to AmeriCorps. They should move quickly.</p><gpt-ad format="injector" sizes-at-0="mobile-wide,native,house" sizes-at-976="desktop-wide,native,house" targeting-pos="csi-ad-0"></gpt-ad><p></p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">“The Trump-Epstein story is the story of the Trump administration—corruption benefiting his rich and powerful cronies at the expense of vulnerable people,” Eisen explained as I lurked on the July call with everyone’s permission.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">The plan was to file a Hail Mary lawsuit to force the Department of Justice to release any documents in its possession that tie Epstein, a convicted child sex offender, to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/07/trump-epstein-denials/683638/">Trump</a>. Eisen’s team had already filed the request for anything that connects the two men, under the Freedom of Information Act. The FOIA is normally a weak tool for unlocking investigative records gathered for criminal investigations, but Eisen had a legal theory: Because the DOJ had argued under pressure after Bondi’s announcement that the extraordinary public interest in the Epstein case required the unsealing of grand-jury testimony, they could argue the same thing. And that was just the beginning.</p><p></p><p data-zephr-outcome-label="HG_TSDS_na_na_MTC_RM_Games" data-zephr-sdk-feature-slug="article"></p><p data-zephr-outcome-label="HG_TSDS_na_na_MTC_RM_Games" data-zephr-sdk-feature-slug="article"></p><p></p></section></div>
