  Media coverage of the anti-immigration marches was a 'propaganda triumph' for

<p>Last Sunday’s <a href="https://www.crikey.com.au/2025/09/01/march-for-australia-neo-nazi-anti-immigration-pictures/">March for Australia anti-immigration protests</a> saw the most significant far-right escalation in years. Australia’s biggest neo-Nazi group, the National Socialist Network (NSN), led thousands in a march down Bourke Street in Melbourne; allegedly <a href="https://www.crikey.com.au/2025/09/02/attack-on-camp-sovereignty-march-for-australia-fear-extremism/">attacked Indigenous protesters at Camp Sovereignty</a>, unprovoked; and days later, its leader Thomas Sewell gatecrashed Victorian Premier Jacinta Allen’s press conference.</p>
<p>These are simultaneously newsworthy events <em>and</em> part of the deliberate “media-baiting” strategy neo-Nazis use to raise their profile and recruit new members. Experts and advocacy groups warn that there is a fine line between critically reporting on neo-Nazis and amplifying their message — a line crossed repeatedly in the past week.</p>
<h2>The perfect landscape for media-baiting</h2>
<p>Kurt Sengul, a researcher of the far right at Macquarie University, says negative media coverage is sought after by these groups. “Even if the articles are mostly negative, they have said the readers are not the target audience. They’re trying to win over younger people who might be sympathetic to their cause — the propaganda triumph is the goal of these visible demonstrations.”</p>
<p>Sengul references the NSN’s leaked manual that outlined exactly how members should try to bait the media with stunts and activations, <a href="https://www.crikey.com.au/2021/04/20/leaked-neo-nazi-manual-manipulating-media-recruit/">as first reported in <em>Crikey</em></a> by Cam Wilson.</p>
<p>The NSN demonstration on Australia Day in Sydney last year is another example, with one NSN figure “gloating” about the amount of publicity those very small marches received.</p>
<p>In 2018, American scholar Whitney Phillips published <a href="https://datasociety.net/library/oxygen-of-amplification/"><em>The Oxygen of Amplification: Better Practices for Reporting on Extremists, Antagonists, and Manipulators Online</em></a>, a seminal work documenting how hate groups had hijacked US media to spread their beliefs to the mainstream. It includes extensive advice for reporters and newsrooms. While the majority of this advice is still relevant, the significant changes to the media landscape in the past seven years present new challenges.</p>
<p>In particular, advice to mostly ignore individuals and groups on the very fringes of society is no longer practical in the current political landscape. “We’ve seen an increasing convergence between the grassroots protest arena and the elected political arena,” Sengul says. “So that becomes difficult for journalists to navigate when a lot of these actors are now firmly connected to political parties, and political parties in power. People who we once considered conspiracy theorists are now sitting in the White House press briefing room.”</p>
<p>On top of this, <a href="https://apo.org.au/sites/default/files/resource-files/2025-06/apo-nid330740_0.pdf">47% of Australians are getting news from social media</a>. These algorithmic platforms with minimal moderation are environments where far-right messaging can flourish even without the help of legacy media.</p>
<p>Progressive and well-intentioned news “influencers” on these platforms have sometimes shared neo-Nazis’ posts of their own media stunts, calling on the mainstream media to cover these agitations while unaware of the dangers in doing so.</p>
<h2>What, when and how to cover neo-Nazis</h2>
<p>The White Rose Society is a collective of anti-fascist researchers based in Australia, named after the non-violent, intellectual resistance group founded in 1942 in Nazi Germany. It has published a set of <a href="https://thewhiterosesociety.writeas.com/9-principles-for-journalists-reporting-on-neo-nazis">nine principles to guide journalists</a> in producing responsible coverage of neo-Nazis. Instructions include:</p>
<ul> <li>Considering the framing of the coverage — weighing up the stories neo-Nazis want told (that they are “scary” or that they are “just everyday Australians”) versus the stories they want hidden (grooming of minors and “cult-like structure”);</li> <li>Blurring their banners, signals and flags;</li> <li>Not confusing them for “One Nation-era racists”;</li> <li>Not positioning laws and increased policing as “the only solution”.</li> </ul>
<p>“It’s about not exaggerating their importance. That’s one of the areas where the [Australia] media lets themselves down: the disproportionate attention and exaggerating their relevance,” Sengul says. He gives the example of the <a href="https://www.crikey.com.au/2025/04/29/neo-nazi-dawn-service-welcomes-to-country-peter-dutton-election-2025/">booing of Uncle Mark Brown’s Welcome to Country</a> at the 2025 Anzac Day Dawn Service in Melbourne. Orchestrated by the NSN, the booing was legitimised by some sections of the media as a valid item of public discourse for the final week of a federal election campaign.</p>
<p>But the most important principle is: don’t interview them. And it’s the guideline that was most flagrantly broken this week, with many outlets running direct quotes and full statements from Sewell.</p>
<p>This goes against the normal journalistic instinct to put the comments of political figures on the record in an effort to hold them accountable. But Sewell has no role in Australian public life or democratic processes, so his opinion does not need to be courted by the media at all. Nor can it be assumed that he would answer in good faith to inform the audience.</p>
<p>“The media is a fundamental democratic institution. These groups are fundamentally anti-democratic. So I do think that there’s a case for the media to treat these groups differently, because they are different,” Sengul says.</p>
<h2>‘Abysmal’ newsrooms not up to the challenge</h2>
<p>The White Rose Society’s instructions rely on journalists — and the editors and executives they work for — caring about the role they play and the impact they have, to put it delicately. “There’s an alignment between the commercial imperatives of the media and the kinds of content that these groups provide,” Sengul says. “That’s an issue.”</p>
<p>Scobie McKay, a journalist and filmmaker who documents the political fringes, said the same on <a href="https://www.crikey.com.au/2025/09/05/cut-through-journalists-played-neo-nazis/"><em>Crikey’s</em> <em>Cut Through</em> podcast</a><strong>.</strong> “Centre-right media [on topics of] migration, identity and race have been beating this drum of fear-mongering. I don’t believe they want a strong [neo-Nazi presence], but they understand that feeding on the fear of migration and the fear of an increasingly multicultural Australia is really good for their profit margins. And by doing so, it’s actually leading a lot of, especially young men, to join this incredibly radical group.”</p>
<p>McKay believes the coverage of last weekend’s marches was “abysmal”. With Australia’s neo-Nazi groups feeling emboldened and more visible than ever, journalists in the legacy media and new media realms need to make sure they’re up for the challenge.</p>
