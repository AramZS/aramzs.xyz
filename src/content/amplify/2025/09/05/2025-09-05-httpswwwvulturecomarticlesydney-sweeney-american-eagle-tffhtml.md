<p><a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/can-we-be-not-be-weird-about-sydney-sweeney-for-5-seconds.html">Sydney Sweeney</a> shan’t talk pant at the <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/tiff-2025-lineup.html">Toronto International Film Festival</a>. In the pages of <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/sydney-sweeney-christy-interview-american-eagle"><em>Vanity Fair</em></a><em>, </em>the actress shut down all American Eagle jeans ad talk ahead of her appearance at the fest. Sweeney went to TIFF to promote her new movie <em>Christy, </em>a biopic of professional boxer Christy Martin. “I am there to support my movie and the people involved in making it, and I’m not there to talk about jeans,” Sweeney said. “The movie’s about Christy, and that’s what I’ll be there to talk about.”</p>
<p>Folks want Sweeney to talk denim because of her recent American Eagle ads which some saw as akin to nazi propaganda. The campaign put forward the idea that Sydney Sweeney has “good jeans” that are passed down from generation to generation. Critics of the ads said they were white supremacist and pro-eugenics. Those who defended them said basically the same thing, but <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSimpsons/comments/1gl6qj0/a_vote_for_bart_is_a_vote_for_anarchy/">in a different font</a>. And Sweeney is saying nothing. She previously refused to talk about jeans at the premiere for <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/sydney-sweeneys-new-movie-is-the-anti-good-jeans-ad.html"><em>Americana</em></a>.</p>
<p>Wall Street is still talking about the Sydney Sweeney jeans ad, however. The collection <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/american-eagle-sydney-sweeney-great-jeans-sales-boost-1236506947/">sold out within a week</a>. But American Eagle saw slightly declining sales overall during the last financial quarter, per the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/05/business/american-eagle-sydney-sweeney-ad-earnings.html">New York <em>Times</em></a><em>. </em>Gap <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/25/entertainment/katseye-gap-ad">seemingly responded</a> to the eu-jean-ic controversy with an ad featuring girl group Katseye dancing to “Milkshake” by Kellis. The commercial has seen streams of “Milkshake” going through the roof, as well as a <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZP8BEWfMA/">TikTok trend</a> of doing the band’s dance inside actual Gaps.</p>
