<p>Sinclair, one of two large local TV owners that dropped “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” after the late-night comedian’s remarks on the Trump administration’s reaction to Charlie Kirk’s assassination, said on Friday that it would resume showing the program after negotiations with ABC.</p>
<p>Sinclair, which owns scores of TV stations across the United States, has been pre-empting “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” since his return on Tuesday, blacking out the program for millions of Americans. Nexstar, another local TV giant, also dropped Mr. Kimmel’s show, setting off a days-long standoff with Disney.</p>
