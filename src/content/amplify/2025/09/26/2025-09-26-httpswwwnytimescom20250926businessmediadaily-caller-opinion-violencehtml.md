<p>The Daily Caller, a prominent conservative online publication, published an opinion column on Friday explicitly calling for violence in response to physical assaults on conservatives in America.</p>
<p>The column, written by editor at large Geoffrey Ingersoll and promoted near the top of the site, argues that “patriots” should use force because law enforcement officials do not adequately protect conservatives, including Charlie Kirk, the activist assassinated this month.</p>
<p>“Is this a call for violence?” the third paragraph says. “Yes. Explicitly it is.”</p>
<p>“I want blood in the streets,” he added in the column, which ran with the headline “Enough Is Enough … I Choose VIOLENCE!”</p>

<p>Mr. Ingersoll also lays out specific situations in which he says violence should be used. If a progressive activist takes a sign away at a public debate, “She gets instantly clotheslined,” Mr. Ingersoll wrote. “I don’t care if police are present. Do it anyway. In fact, be wildly disproportionate.”</p>
<p>“Measure it in blood if necessary,” he added. “Change requires pain, and you’re either taking it or inflicting it.”</p>
<p>Dylan Houseman, the Daily’ Callers editor in chief, said the column did not represent the views of every editor at the publication. But he defended the column, saying it describes acts of “self-defense,” including a recent case in which a woman struck an anti-abortion activist.</p>
<p>“Geoff’s case is that said person should perhaps get punched back, because it’s pretty clear the cops aren’t going to do a damn thing about it,” Mr. Housman said. “I don’t think that’s a radical suggestion.”</p>
<p>He added that attempts to paint Mr. Ingersoll’s column as a call for political violence “is totally dishonest,” adding that The Daily Caller would “never publish someone calling for violence simply over political disagreement.”</p>
<p>In the weeks since Mr. Kirk’s death, many conservatives, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/12/us/politics/trump-charlie-kirk-shooting.html">including President Trump</a>, have argued that progressives are responsible for much of the political violence in the country and have called for vengeance. “We have radical-left lunatics out there, and we just have to beat the hell out of them,” Mr. Trump has said.</p>
<p>Many Democrats have responded by pointing out several prominent violent attacks aimed at progressives, including the killing of a Democratic state lawmaker in Minnesota and her husband, and an assault on the husband of former Speaker Nancy Pelosi.</p>
<p>The Daily Caller was founded in 2010 by Tucker Carlson and Neil Patel, an adviser to former Vice President Dick Cheney. The site is influential in conservative political and media circles, and some of its alumni have gone on to prominent roles in the mainstream media, like the CNN anchor Kaitlan Collins.</p>
<p>In a series of messages to The New York Times, Mr. Ingersoll said that the column, initially labeled an editorial on The Daily Caller site, was a response to “10 years of watching aggravated acts of violence, in public” against conservatives go unpunished.</p>
<p>Mr. Ingersoll, who was formerly The Daily Caller’s editor in chief, said in his messages that “police, college administrators, campus cops and the wider legal system” would not provide security for conservatives and, in some places, wouldn’t prosecute crimes caught on tape.</p>
<p>“So we should protect ourselves,” Mr. Ingersoll said in a message. “Viciously and disproportionately if necessary.”</p>
