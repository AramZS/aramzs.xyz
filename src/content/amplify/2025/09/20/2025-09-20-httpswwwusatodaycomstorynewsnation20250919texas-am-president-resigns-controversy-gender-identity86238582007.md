Welsh III is set to resign Friday Sept. 19, after a professor's recent firing amid controversy over a viral video concerning "gender ideology' in the classroom.</p>
<p>“President Welsh is a man of honor who has led Texas A&amp;M with selfless dedication,” said Chancellor Glenn Hegar said in<a data-id="https://news.tamus.edu/mark-welsh-steps-down-as-president-of-texas-am-university/" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" data-type="link" href="https://news.tamus.edu/mark-welsh-steps-down-as-president-of-texas-am-university/"> a statement</a> released by the college. “We are grateful for his service and contributions. At the same time, we agree that now is the right moment to make a change and to position Texas A&amp;M for continued excellence in the years ahead.”</p>
<p>Hegar and the school's board announced the former Air Force Chief of Staff General "will step down from his role" effective Friday, Sept. 19 at 5 p.m.</p>
<p>Hegar thanked Welsh for his service to the university and the nation, and applauded "his leadership in advancing student success, research growth, and community engagement at Texas A&amp;M."</p>
<p>“General Welsh’s legacy of leadership and service is one that the Aggie family will always remember," Board of Regents Chairman Robert Albritton said. "The Board of Regents is united in ensuring that this transition strengthens the university’s future and keeps Texas A&amp;M true to its mission and values."</p>
<h2>Professor Melissa McCoul fired</h2>
<p>The announcement comes nearly a week after a video of a student confronting a professor over gender content in a children’s literature course.</p>
<p>Welsh fired Professor Melissa McCoul Sept. 9, for allegedly not changing her course content to match its description<a data-id="https://www.amarillo.com/story/news/2025/09/19/texas-am-president-mark-a-welsh-iii-to-step-down-after-viral-video-week-of-turmoil/86239645007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" data-type="link" href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2025/09/19/texas-am-president-mark-a-welsh-iii-to-step-down-after-viral-video-week-of-turmoil/86239645007/">, The Texas Tribune</a>, a non-profit digital news outlet based in Austin reported.</p>
<p>The video, coupled with an audio recording of Welsh first refusing to fire McCoul, began circulating online Sept. 8 after state Rep. Brian Harrison shared it on social media, the outlet reported. Welsh fired McCoul the next day, "but the move did not satisfy Harrison, or Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who did not think Welsh handled the situation properly."</p>
<p>On Friday, Sept. 19, Harrison praised Welsh's resignation news in a post on X.</p>
<p>"We did it! Texas A&amp;M president is out!" the senator wrote in all caps. "End all DEI and LGBTQ Indoctrination in Texas!"</p>
<h2>Who is interim Texas A&amp;M president?</h2>
<p>As of Friday, the school had not announced who it planned to appoint as interim president.</p>
<p>"In the coming days, the Board of Regents, will initiate a national search for a permanent president and appoint an interim president to ensure a seamless transition," officials wrote in the release.</p>
