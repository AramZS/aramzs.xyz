<p>BRUSSELS, Sept 20 (Reuters) - A cyberattack targeting a service provider for check-in and boarding systems has disrupted operations at several major European airports including London's Heathrow, Brussels and Berlin, causing flight delays and cancellations, the operators said.</p>
<p>The attack has rendered automated systems inoperable, allowing only manual check-in and boarding procedures, according to Brussels Airport.</p>
<p>Sign up <a href="https://archive.is/o/eyvxP/https://www.reuters.com/en/cyberattack-causes-flight-delays-cancellations-brussels-airport-2025-09-20/undefined?location=article-paragraph&amp;redirectUrl=/en/cyberattack-causes-flight-delays-cancellations-brussels-airport-2025-09-20/">here.</a></p>
<p>"This has a large impact on the flight schedule and will unfortunately cause delays and cancellations of flights," the operator said in a statement published on its website.</p>
<p>"The service provider is actively working on the issue and trying to resolve the problem as quickly as possible."</p>
<p>Heathrow also warned of delays caused by "a technical issue" at a third-party supplier.</p>
<p>Passengers with a flight scheduled for Saturday were advised by the affected airports to confirm their travel with airlines before heading to the airport.</p>
<p>"Due to a technical issue at a system provider operating across Europe, there are longer waiting times at check-in. We are working on a quick solution," Berlin airport said in a banner on its website.</p>
<p>Frankfurt Airport is not affected by the attack, a spokesperson said.</p>
