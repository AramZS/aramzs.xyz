<p>There are tens, if not hundreds, of millions of websites that use WordPress for their content management system. People, businesses, schools, major news organizations, and governments run WordPress.</p>
<p>Platforms like Shopify, Squarespace, and Wix have begun to eat into WordPress’s web dominance, but it remains a widely used content management system, both for self-hosted sites and those that run on <a href="https://wordpress.com">wordpress.com</a>. (More on that distinction in a second.)</p>
<p>It’s important for investigators to know the unique ways you can dig into a WP site, as you’ll likely encounter them on a regular basis. This is particularly true for people that track low quality sites that masquerade as news sources. Such sites often run on WP.</p>
<p>That was the case for <a href="https://kallkritikbyran.se/vietnamesisk-klickbetesfabrik-bakom-sommarens-svenska-ai-bluffar/">a recent investigation</a> by Jonathan Lundberg, a freelance Swedish journalist. He was reporting on a group of Facebook pages that were sharing deceptive AI slop. They’re very similar to hoax pages <a href="https://indicator.media/p/celebrity-slop-hoax-pages-thrive-under-meta-loosened-moderation-caitlin-clark-colbert-lebron-vanessa">that I’ve reported on</a>, except the ones Lundberg found were targeting Swedish-speaking audiences. And they consistently shared links to sites that ran on WordPress.</p>
<p>Thanks to a WordPress tip from <a href="https://nikkasystems.com/">Karl Emil Nikka</a>, a Swedish IT security specialist, Lundberg was able to find information that helped him identify a person and company that appear to be connected to the operation.</p>
<p>Here’s how you can use the same tip in your investigations, along with additional OSINT approaches for investigating WordPress sites.</p>
