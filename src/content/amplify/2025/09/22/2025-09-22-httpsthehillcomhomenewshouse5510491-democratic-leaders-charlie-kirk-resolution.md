title: Democratic leaders will support resolution honoring Charlie Kirk
---
<p>House Democratic leaders will vote in favor of a GOP resolution condemning political violence and celebrating <a href="https://thehill.com/people/charlie-kirk/">Charlie Kirk </a>in the wake of last week’s fatal shooting of the conservative activist in Utah — a measure expected to hit the floor later this week.</p>
<p>In a closed-door meeting in the Capitol basement on Thursday morning, top leaders informed rank-and-file lawmakers that they will support the resolution, though they will not push other members to do the same.</p>
<p>The vote is a tricky one for Democrats.</p>
<p>While Democratic lawmakers in the Capitol have been unanimous in condemning Kirk’s killing — and political violence in general — they were also no fans of the conservative activist and many of the political positions he promoted.</p>
<p>That was especially true in the realm of race and civil rights, where <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/11/us/charlie-kirk-views-guns-gender-climate.html">Kirk’s criticisms</a> of the Civil Rights Act, Martin Luther King, Jr., and gay and transgender rights have been soundly denounced by Democrats on and off of Capitol Hill. Many saw him as a divisive figure in the mold of President Trump.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-resolution/719/text?s=1&amp;r=1&amp;q=%7B%22search%22%3A%22hres+719%22%7D">The GOP resolution</a>, sponsored by Speaker <a href="https://thehill.com/people/mike-johnson/">Mike Johnson </a>(R-La.), promotes two separate messages. The first eulogizes Kirk’s life and work, praising him as one who engaged in “respectful, civil discourse” and “worked tirelessly to promote unity without compromising on conviction.” The second condemns political violence in “all forms” and calls on all Americans “to reject political violence, recommit to respectful debate, uphold American values, and respect one another as fellow Americans.”</p>
<p>This week’s vote, then, has created a dilemma for some Democratic lawmakers. If they vote against the resolution, Republicans will attack them for a failure to condemn political violence across the board. If they vote for it, they will be on record lauding, as a unifier, a figure whose political views they deemed toxic and divisive.</p>
<p>It’s unclear how many Democrats will oppose the resolution. But given the sensitivity of the topic, Democratic leaders are not whipping the vote, instead leaving it to individual lawmakers to decide whether to support the measure.</p>
