<p>Activism is at the heart of everything Ben &amp; Jerry’s does.</p>
<p>We believe that ice cream can change the world, and are driven by a mission to eliminate international injustices. This is a value Ben &amp; Jerry’s customers share, and it’s been at the heart of its success.</p>
<p>That’s why, when the company was acquired by Unilever twenty-five years ago, we fought hard to make sure that commitment was protected, to retain the company’s values and protect its commitment to social justice. It’s a crucial part of what Ben &amp; Jerry’s is as a company.</p>
<p>But that mission is now under threat. In the past few years, the company has increasingly faced pressure and censorship to stay silent in the face of injustices, undermining the very mission under which it was formed. On issues from the war in Gaza, to marriage equality, to indigenous rights, to diversity, equity and inclusion, the company’s voice has been stifled.</p>
<p>Many businesses used to talk about their values, only to drop them when things became difficult. But we still know there is a better way to do things. That’s why, as Unilever seeks to undertake a major overhaul of its businesses, we are taking action.</p>
<p>Unilever will be de-merging its ice cream business under Magnum Ice Cream Company. But a different logo doesn’t mean different values.</p>
<p>Unilever is expected to remain a shareholder, and Magnum’s leadership will be many of the same people involved in Unilever’s efforts to silence Ben &amp; Jerry’s.</p>
<p>That’s why we are on a mission to free Ben &amp; Jerry’s from Magnum.</p>
<p>Ben &amp; Jerry’s cannot thrive under an organization that stifles its values and that buckles under political pressure.</p>
<p>An independent Ben &amp; Jerry’s will allow it to go back to its roots as a company driven by values, authenticity, and a belief that business has to be about more than just profitability.</p>
