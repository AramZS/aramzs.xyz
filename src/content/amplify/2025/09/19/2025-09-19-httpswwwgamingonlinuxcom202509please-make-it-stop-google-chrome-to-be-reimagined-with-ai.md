title: Please make it stop - Google Chrome to be reimagined with AI

<p>A break from the usual gaming news to moan about Google for a moment, thanks to their new blog post we have a glimpse of the future of Chrome and it's AI AI AI.</p>
<p>Google say they're about to take a step that will result in "fundamentally changing the nature of browsing" to move from a "passive experience to a more proactive and intelligent one". With that they've announced some major changes will be coming to Chrome.</p>
<p>The first is Gemini, their AI assistant, it's going to be your new "browsing assistant" that will "answer questions about articles, find references within YouTube videos, and will soon be able to help you find pages youâ€™ve visited so you can pick up exactly where you left off" and it will integrate with other Google services.</p>
<p>On top of that they're planning to make "more advanced agentic capabilities for Gemini in Chrome that can perform multi-step tasks for you from start to finish". Difficult things like "booking a haircut" or "ordering your weekly groceries" will be a thing of the past Google hope, as they'll get their AI to do it for you.</p>
<p>Another change will be to the address bar, their "omnibox", as it's going to get "even smarter" with their new AI Mode.</p>
<p>Although, they only mention Windows and macOS for this in the post, no doubt it would come to Linux <em>eventually</em>.</p>

<p>More info across their <a href="https://blog.google/products/chrome/chrome-reimagined-with-ai/">announcement</a> and another <a href="https://blog.google/products/chrome/new-ai-features-for-chrome/">blog post</a> on some of the features.</p>
<p>So soon, you'll be told to add glue to pizza right in the address bar in Google Chrome! <em>Because we all know how factually accurate these AI tools are of course, they never ever make things up. </em>And with their AI Mode right in the browser, the idea of course like with AI Mode on Google Search, is to get you to never click away from anything Google. They want you to stay in their products longer, to generate more data and more revenue from you.</p>
<p>Firefox has also started adding in more AI features too, because apparently that's what everyone will be getting whether you like it or not. You simply must become part of the AI machine.</p>
<p>At no point in my entire browsing history have I ever thought - you know what would make this better? AI!</p>
<p>I think it's time I gave Vivaldi another chance, with <a href="https://vivaldi.com/blog/keep-exploring/">their commitment</a> to keeping things human.</p>
