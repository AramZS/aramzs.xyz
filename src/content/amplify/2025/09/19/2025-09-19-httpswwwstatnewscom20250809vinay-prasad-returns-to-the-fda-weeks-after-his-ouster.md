<p>WASHINGTON — Vinay Prasad is returning to the Food and Drug Administration to resume his role overseeing vaccine, gene therapy, and blood product regulation.</p>
<p>“At the FDA’s request, Dr. Vinay Prasad is resuming leadership of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research,” Health and Human Services spokesperson Andrew Nixon told STAT on Saturday.</p>
<p>It is not clear whether he will also still serve as the FDA’s chief medical and scientific officer. Prasad <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/07/29/vinay-prasad-exits-fda-marty-makary-cber-director-chief-medical-scientific-officer/">left the agency</a> a mere two weeks ago, after escalating tensions related to a gene therapy product for Duchenne’s muscular dystrophy made by Sarepta Therapeutics and a campaign criticizing Prasad’s politics, launched by right-wing influencer Laura Loomer.</p>
