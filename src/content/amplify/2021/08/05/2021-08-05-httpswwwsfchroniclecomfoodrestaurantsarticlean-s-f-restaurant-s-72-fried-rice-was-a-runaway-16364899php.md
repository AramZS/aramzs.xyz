  An S.F. restaurant's $72 fried rice was a runaway hit. It was also the chef's
  nightmare

<p>The crab fried rice at Lily, <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/food/article/Thrilling-new-S-F-Vietnamese-restaurant-brings-a-15612895.php">a Vietnamese restaurant in the Richmond District</a>, had the aesthetics of a jewelry display: radiant bubbles of golden trout and white sturgeon caviar, unctuous uni (sea urchin roe) from Hokkaido, Japan, and the meat from three types of crab were arranged on a bed of expertly fried jasmine rice. Bite-size morsels of grilled A4 Miyazaki Wagyu sirloin topped it, along with rock shrimp and the deep-tangerine of jidori egg yolks. Black truffle trimmings bolstered an XO sauce drizzle. It was, all in all, a spectacular example of luxury overload.</p>
<p>Despite its $72 price tag, it was also the restaurant’s best-seller, both during its takeout-only days and when the space finally opened for in-person dining. Some nights, 20 to 25 fried rice orders would come in, while customers ignored the rest of the menu. Chef Rob Lam couldn’t take it. In June, he killed the dish.</p>
<p>The crab fried rice was a stunt dish, akin to innovations like <a href="https://vanleeuwenicecream.com/product/kraft-mac-and-cheese/">Kraft macaroni and cheese ice cream </a>and <a href="https://global.kfc.com/press-releases/the-wait-is-over-the-double-down-is-back-at-kfc-the-sandwich-without-bread">bunless chicken patty sandwiches</a>. From a marketing standpoint, they’re flashy things that attract attention on social media and in headlines: The carnival that brings everybody to town.</p>
<p>It seems counterintuitive for a small, independent restaurant like Lily to take off a menu item that’s gone viral — to run through the carnival ripping down the banners while people are still trying to enter the gates. After a friend told me about the crab fried rice, I checked the restaurant’s Instagram page and noticed that the Lily team had tried to get rid of the rice twice already. On <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CQwHhhLruql/">a post from June 30</a>, the last announcement of the dish’s demise, they wrote, “We never meant for this to take off! This dish isn’t even Vietnamese!!!” You don’t have to be exceptionally skilled at reading between the lines to pick up on the stress in those exclamation points.</p>

<p>It had started as a joke.</p>
<p>Lily started serving the crab fried rice around Christmas of 2020, two months after it opened, and it was supposed to be a two-week item, Lam admitted — a gimmick for the holidays. “The premise was, let’s do something so over-the-top and bougie,” he said. “We called it the #1 douchebag fried rice.” (On the menu, it was the much more politically correct #1 Dac Biet Fried Rice, with “dac biet” meaning “the works” or “special” in Vietnamese.) He expected that most people would see it and chuckle at the gall, then order the pho. They’d probably only sell three a night, if that.</p>
<p>Sometimes restaurants do that kind of thing for a laugh, especially when business is down and the chef gets bored. At a fine dining restaurant I worked at, we dressed up a Choco Taco with intricate house-made gelees and gold leaf to serve as a final course for a child who came in with his parents one night. At another, the chef bent over backwards to figure out how to make a corny pun work as a satisfying, actually good-to-eat dish.</p>
<p>To really land a joke, you have to commit to it, so Lam did. He sourced premium red king crab claws from a Japanese supplier; caviar from the California Caviar company and Tsar Nicoulai. His beef was from a high-end ranch that fed its cattle on olives, granting their meat more umami flavor and healthier fatty acids. He studied the art of fried rice with friend and colleague James Yu, who produces ideally fluffy and crisp wok-seared fried rice at his restaurant, Great China, in Berkeley. Lam’s team picked the meat from king crabs, snow crabs and Dungeness crabs and used the shells to make a stock, which they turned into a concentrated, multispecies crab essence that was folded into butter. Taking all of this trouble was one way to keep his cooks interested in the work during a soul-sucking time when all they were doing was takeout. Plus, the bottom line was that Lam didn’t want to put out crappy food, even if it was just for laughs.</p>
<p>The weird thing was, after all that effort, no one was laughing. Not the influencers, who immediately embraced the dish as the next hot thing to eat in San Francisco. Not the wok cook in the kitchen, deep in the weeds with 20 fried rice orders a night. And not Lam and the restaurant owners, Lily and Lucy Lieu, who suddenly found themselves in an existential crisis, trapped in a joke that kept stretching on and on without a punchline.</p>
<p>It didn’t help that they didn’t make any money on the fried rice with all of its premium, market-rate ingredients, or that customers would only order that and nothing else on the menu. The Lily team started sensing that their biggest draw was taking the business somewhere they didn’t want to go. They worried that doing more dishes in that price range would irrevocably change the public’s perception of who was welcome in the restaurant. “This wasn’t us,” Lam said. “It wasn’t who we wanted to be.”</p>
<p>While I don’t necessarily chase the adrenaline rush of eating dishes made to shock and awe, I can’t say I’ve never been tempted. I’ve watched as truffle shavings rained down on mac and cheese at a Michelin-starred restaurant. I’ve snapped into a Doritos Loco taco. Part of me had to be in-the-know, to be able to nod and have an opinion when people asked, even if the food itself wasn’t particularly good.</p>
<p>At Lily, I never got the chance to eat the crab fried rice. But what I did eat felt honest to Lam’s freewheeling style. Lam’s pantry includes not only humble shrimp paste and Maggi seasoning sauce but Roquefort cheese and Little Gem lettuces. Yet the Vietnamese flavors aren’t muddled by these additions. The pungency of the shrimp paste caramel-coated chicken wings ($17) and their Roquefort dipping sauce made my head spin. My spine tingled with the sour lime juice coating the beef carpaccio ($22), which I scooped into my mouth with fried, bubbly sesame crackers. And there were shades of the fried rice in the bun rieu ($48), an intense take on the classic rice noodle soup filled with king crab meatballs, fried soft shell crabs and Early Girl tomatoes.</p>

<p>Here, details matter a lot. As you sit in the dining room, you’ll notice the intricate geometric woodwork of the ceiling and the painted, classically styled mural on the wall. As you eat, you’ll observe hand-picked bachelor button flowers on the shaking beef salad ($26) and fried chicken skin shards tucked into the grilled chicken banh mi ($16). Mango chicken salad ($16) is tossed with spicy tomato sambal and cut-up pieces of rice paper that stick to your teeth.</p>
<p>Part of a new generation of Vietnamese American restaurants, Lily takes inspiration from the examples of the Slanted Door and Crustacean, as well as the culinary advances of post-war Vietnam. It’s hoping to take a diasporic cuisine steeped in nostalgia somewhere new and thoughtful.</p>
<p>When Lam was telling me about this story, I couldn’t stop thinking about a certain night I spent at a dive bar in Minneapolis. It was probably freezing outside, and I was probably drinking some awful beer while watching some friends’ band open for some guy I never heard of. When the headliner got onstage, he played a familiar guitar riff; he was Phil Solem, co-founder of the Rembrandts, and the song was, “I’ll Be There For You.” Almost a decade after “Friends” ended on television, Solem played the song that made him famous to a crowd that was likely in middle school when the show aired. It’s the song he likely dined out on for years, and I had to wonder: Does he still like the song? Does that even matter at this point?</p>
<p>It takes a lot of courage to stop doing something that people want you to do, which is why I admire Lam and the Lily team for sticking to their principles. People still request the fried rice when they come in to eat, which feels to me like yelling “Free Bird!” at a Lynyrd Skynyrd concert.</p>
<p>As far as Lam’s concerned, the carnival is over. “We will never have another uni in this restaurant.”</p>
