<p>Vice Media's plan to go public is being stalled in part by negotiations with its private equity backer, TPG, according to two people with knowledge of the conversations.</p>
<p>The youth-focused entertainment and news company run by Nancy Dubuc is in talks to merge with 7GC &amp; Co. and go public as part of a <a data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' href="https://www.businessinsider.com/most-interesting-media-spacs-to-watch-2021-1?op=1">SPAC</a>, at a valuation of around $2.5 billion.</p>
<p>Vice wants to use money raised in the SPAC to fund its operations and make acquisitions, while TPG wants to be able to use at least some of that capital to buy out some of its stake, one of the sources said.</p>
<p>TPG's investment of $450 million in 2017 came with onerous terms that have long been a stumbling block to Vice's fundraising ambitions.</p>
<p>Vice agreed to make payments of up to $400 million to TPG in stock and cash dividends until 2024, according to <a data-track-click='{"click_type":"other","element_name":"body_link","event":"outbound_click"}' href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/vice-media-raised-money-at-a-sky-high-valuation-now-the-bill-is-coming-due-11581450643">The Wall Street Journal.</a></p>
<p>A third person close to the business disputed the notion that TPG was looking to cash out, saying, "It is not selling any of its equity holdings and is rolling its equity holdings into the company as a significant common shareholder and into the flattened go-forward public capital structure." TPG declined to comment for this story.</p>
<p>News of the prolonged SPAC negotiations was first reported by <a data-am-orig-url="https://affiliate.insider.com/?h=e1edda2ea3ff8589e67121bd90b183d3192f67a6587ba6d28c4d0f0c60dc5546&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theinformation.com%2Farticles%2Fvice-medias-spac-talks-stall" data-track-click='{"click_type":"affiliate","element_name":"body_link","event":"outbound_click"}' data-track-click-secondary='{"event":"outbound_affiliate_click","element_name":"body_link","brand_name":"bi_value_unassigned","deal_price":"bi_value_unassigned","depth":"bi_value_unassigned","index":"bi_value_unassigned","number_purchase_options":"bi_value_unassigned","price":"bi_value_unassigned","product_badge":"bi_value_unassigned","product_category":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned","product_id":"bi_value_unassigned","product_name":"bi_value_unassigned","purchase_options_index":"bi_value_unassigned","retailer_name":"bi_value_unassigned"}' href="https://affiliate.insider.com/?h=e1edda2ea3ff8589e67121bd90b183d3192f67a6587ba6d28c4d0f0c60dc5546&amp;platform=browser&amp;postID=610c166bfdabbb5be36d400c&amp;postSlug=tpg-demands-stall-vice-media-public-listing-2021-8&amp;site=bi&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theinformation.com%2Farticles%2Fvice-medias-spac-talks-stall">The Information,</a> which reported that Vice was having difficulty raising money amid questions about its valuation. Vice is yet to announce that it has completed its PIPE, the private investors who will provide the capital to go public. The market for SPACs overall has slowed, with investors deluged with requests for backing.</p>
<p>Vice is trying to raise cash at the same time as <a data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' href="https://www.businessinsider.com/key-slides-from-buzzfeed-investor-deck-2021-6">digital media peer BuzzFeed</a>, whose valuation of $1.5 billion, down from its peak of $1.7 billion, might have depressed how investors see Vice. However, Blackstone's agreeing to back a deal to acquire Reese Witherspoon's production company, <a data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' href="https://www.businessinsider.com/reese-witherspoon-hello-sunshine-reportedly-sold-for-900-million-2021-8">Hello Sunshine</a>, for a reported $900 million, could change how Vice's model is valued.</p>
<p>One source told Insider that early Vice investor <a data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' href="https://www.businessinsider.com/james-murdoch-laurene-powell-jobs-invest-in-podcasting-startup-waitwhat-2021-6?op=1">James Murdoch</a>, who was not initially in favor of a public listing, is now on board with the plan, which could help Vice fund expansion. A spokeswoman for James Murdoch declined to comment.</p>
<p>Regardless of Vice's future, Shane Smith, the former Vice CEO and its current executive chairman, managed to translate his investment into some bankable assets. In spring, he unloaded his Pacific Palisades home in Los Angeles for a record $49 million, doubling his money on the deal, according to the <a data-track-click='{"click_type":"other","element_name":"body_link","event":"outbound_click"}' href="https://www.latimes.com/business/real-estate/story/2021-04-20/vices-shane-smith-sells-compound-for-48-67-million-a-palisades-record">Los Angeles Times.</a></p>
