<p>Following her murderous turn in “Raw,” Rumpf played the lead in 2017 Berlin opener “Tiger Girl” and won the fest’s rising star award for “Beast,” before making her first move into TV with Netflix’s German-language crime series “Freud.”</p>
<p>The “Succession” Season 3 action will pick up with Logan Roy (Brian Cox) in a perilous position after an ambush by his rebellious, if somewhat spineless son Kendall (Jeremy Strong).

<p>“Succession” was created by Jesse Armstrong, who also serves as showrunner. He executive produces along with Adam McKay, Frank Rich, Kevin Messick, Will Ferrell, Jane Tranter, Mark Mylod, Tony Roche, Jon Brown and Scott Ferguson.</p>
<p>Rumpf is represented by Management 360, Agence Adequat and Spielkind.</p>
