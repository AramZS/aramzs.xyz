  "Harry Potter" Actor Katie Leung Claims That Publicists Told Her To Deny That
  She Was Experiencing Racist Attacks While Filming
---
<h2> You know Katie Leung from the <i>Harry Potter</i> film series, in which she portrayed Cho Chang. </h2>

<h2> On <a data-affiliate="true" data-bonsai-initialized="" data-skimlinks-tracking="5891812" href="https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/chinese-chippy-girl/id1526895182">a recent episode of the <i>Chinese Chippy Girl</i> podcast</a>, Leung claimed that she faced racist attacks after her role as Cho was announced — and that she was told by publicists to deny they were happening. </h2>
<figure><picture> <source media="(min-width: 52rem)" srcset="https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2021-03/11/4/asset/954e251d8ee7/sub-buzz-15589-1615436691-2.jpg?downsize=700%3A%2A&amp;output-quality=auto&amp;output-format=auto 1600w"/> <source srcset="https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2021-03/11/4/asset/954e251d8ee7/sub-buzz-15589-1615436691-2.jpg?downsize=700%3A%2A&amp;output-quality=auto&amp;output-format=auto 800w"/> </picture></figure>
<h2> "I was, like, googling myself at one point, and I was on this website, which was kind of dedicated to the kind of <i>Harry Potter</i> fandom," Leung — who was cast in <i>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</i> when she was 16 — recalled. "I remember reading all the comments. And yeah, it was a lot of racist shit." </h2>
<figure><picture> <source media="(min-width: 52rem)" srcset="https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2021-03/11/4/asset/16114ac08f26/sub-buzz-15429-1615437064-1.jpg?downsize=700%3A%2A&amp;output-quality=auto&amp;output-format=auto 1600w"/> <source srcset="https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2021-03/11/4/asset/16114ac08f26/sub-buzz-15429-1615437064-1.jpg?downsize=700%3A%2A&amp;output-quality=auto&amp;output-format=auto 800w"/> </picture></figure>
<h2> Leung claims she even found a "hate site" dedicated to her — but when she talked to publicists about it, "I remember them saying to me, 'Oh, look, Katie, we haven't seen these, these websites that people are talking about. And you know? If you get asked that, just say it's not true, say it's not happening.'" </h2>

<h2> Leung also says she was "really fucking grateful" to be part of the film franchise, but the position she was put in was difficult in its own way: "I keep saying, like, 'Oh I wish I'd maybe said something.' But you can't do that." </h2>
