<p>A hiker lost on a mountain in Colorado ignored repeated calls from rescuers — later explaining that they had been unfamiliar with the phone number, authorities said.</p>
<p>The person was reported missing after they didn’t return from an expedition Oct. 18 on Mount Elbert, the highest peak in the state, Lake County Search and Rescue said.</p>
<p>Search crews canvassed the area the following day, but couldn’t find the hiker, officials said.</p>
<p>The team then tried to call the hiker, but were unable to reach them, authorities said.</p>
<p>The hiker had apparently wandered off the trail and spent the night looking for it.</p>
<p>After 24 hours lost, they found their way out and made it to their car, officials said.</p>
<p>The person apparently didn’t know that a search team had been looking for them.</p>
<p>“The subject ignored repeated phone calls from us because they didn’t recognize the number,” rescuers wrote on Facebook.</p>
<p>“If you’re overdue according to your itinerary, and you start getting repeated calls from an unknown number, please answer the phone; it may be a [search and rescue] team trying to confirm you’re safe!”</p>
