<p>Depending on who you ask, NFT’s might be a <a href="https://gizmodo.com/people-are-shelling-out-six-figures-for-nft-rocks-1847508926">weird cosmic joke</a> or an <a href="https://gizmodo.com/how-to-fix-crypto-art-nfts-carbon-pollution-problem-1846440312">ecological disaster</a> waiting to happen—but neither is stopping major platforms from hopping on the non-fungible bandwagon themselves. The latest social media giant on that list seems to be Reddit, according to a fresh job posting <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/reddit-nft-marketplace-build-biggest-creator-economy-crypto-platform-job-2021-10?utm_source=feedly&amp;utm_medium=webfeeds">first spotted by Insider</a> that suggests the so-called “front page of the internet” is gearing up to launch an NFT marketplace of its very own.</p>
<p>“In case you haven’t heard, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are the newest, most explosive movement in the world of crypto,” reads the <a href="https://boards.greenhouse.io/reddit/jobs/3454478">still-posted job listing</a> for a “Senior Backend Engineer” to build out Reddit’s nascent NFT platform. “For many, it’s a way to support their favorite artists, and for others it’s a way to curate impressive collections of ultra-rare collectibles. Just as cryptocurrencies are set to revolutionize the world of economics and finance, NFTs are going to rewrite how we think about digital goods.”</p>
<p>Among other responsibilities, the engineer that Reddit taps for this role will be tasked with designing and building a backend service “for millions of users to create, buy, sell and use NFT-backed digital goods.” While that kind of setup would pit Reddit against other marketplace players in the non-fungible token space, like <a href="https://opensea.io/">Opensea</a> and <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/nft/home">Binance</a>, other social media players are looking for other ways to tackle NFT’s. Twitter, for example, is apparently working on a profile tab for “Collectables,” which would let users show off their <a href="https://news.artnet.com/market/updated-most-expensive-nfts-1980942">exorbitantly priced</a> digital doodads.</p>
<blockquote data-dnt="true" data-width="500"> <p>Twitter is working on Collectibles profile tab, NFT view and NFT details view <a href="https://t.co/BrqPyvaLOp">pic.twitter.com/BrqPyvaLOp</a></p> <p>— Jane Manchun Wong (@wongmjane) <a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1452373149689909248?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 24, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p>According to <a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1452373149689909248?s=20">a post</a> from reverse engineer extraordinaire Jane Manchun Wong this past weekend, Twitter is also working in a tab that would give you some extra deets about each NFT; the description, the “artist,” the collection it’s a part of (if any), and more. From the screenshots Wong posted, it seems like the NFT tab would find a home at the top of people’s profile page, alongside other new features like Twitter’s <a href="https://gizmodo.com/if-you-use-twitters-new-tip-jar-feature-make-sure-you-1846841259">new Tip Jars</a>. (It’s worth keeping in mind that platforms test out all kinds of things that never see a full rollout.)</p>
<p>Like <a href="https://gizmodo.com/nobody-wants-ads-in-twitter-replies-not-even-advertiser-1847863937">some</a> <a href="https://gizmodo.com/twitter-is-buying-its-way-out-of-being-twitter-1845991542">of</a> Twitter’s recent product rollouts, Reddit’s creep into NFT-dom feels a bit like a desperate grab from a platform that’s long struggled to suck out some of the online ad revenue from the <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/duopoly-still-rules-global-digital-ad-market-alibaba-amazon-on-prowl">Facebook/Google duopoly</a>. Reddit’s issues with courting advertisers are <a href="https://www.vox.com/2014/4/8/11625354/reddit-execs-ellen-pao-and-jena-donlin-get-serious-about-the-sites">nothing new</a>, but the company’s only <a href="https://www.adweek.com/programmatic/reddit-unveils-new-ad-inventory-options-with-nod-to-brand-safety/">just started</a> to offer big brands (and their big-brand bucks) certain tools to keep their content from running alongside its platform’s most <a href="https://medium.com/@triketora/ask-me-anything-about-reddits-cesspit-of-toxicity-f4c9e89a4da6">toxic content</a>. In fact, Reddit actually took a step backward on the brand-friendly front when it <a href="https://adage.com/article/digital-marketing-ad-tech-news/reddit-debuts-new-ad-placement-conversation-threads/2362541">announced last month</a> that it would be wedging ads in between people’s conversation threads. Perhaps uncoincidentally, Twitter announced it would be doing the same earlier this month—a move that we <a href="https://gizmodo.com/nobody-wants-ads-in-twitter-replies-not-even-advertiser-1847863937">pointed out</a> would be sure to tick off advertisers and Twitter users alike.</p>
<p>Unlike Twitter, though, Reddit also needs to worry about <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-reddit-seeks-hire-advisers-us-ipo-sources-2021-09-02/">a forthcoming IPO</a>, which means it’s going to try to raise lots and lots (<a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/services/deals/library/cost-of-an-ipo.html">and</a><a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/services/deals/library/cost-of-an-ipo.html">lots</a>) of capital. And if it can’t hack the digital ad market, maybe it can crack the NFT market instead.</p>
<p>“If there is one thing we’ve noticed with NFTs, they too have an incredible power to create a sense of participation and belonging,” Reddit wrote in its job listing.</p>
<p>“Fans of today’s biggest creators and brands are now flocking to buy digital goods directly from them—to support them, to gain exclusive access, and to feel a greater sense of connection with them,” Reddit went on. “Over time, we believe this will only grow, and NFTs will play a central role in how fans support their favorite creators and communities.”</p>
<p>Considering how <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/todays-real-story-the-facebook-monopoly/">Facebook also monopolizes</a> giant chunks of the creator economy (via Instagram), Reddit will have its work cut out for it cornering that market as well. Best of luck, I guess!!</p>
