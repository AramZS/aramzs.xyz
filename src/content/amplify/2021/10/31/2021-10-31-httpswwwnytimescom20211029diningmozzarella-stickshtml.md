title: 'It’s a Stretch, but Mozzarella Sticks Are Having a Moment'
---
<p>Americans’ renewed desire for the nostalgic comfort food may be partly the result of enduring a pandemic.</p>

<p><i>By </i><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/priya-krishna">Priya Krishna</a></p>
<p>Scroll TikTok for even just a few minutes, and you’re likely to encounter a video of gooey cheese being pulled into shiny, stretchy strands. It’s a mesmerizing moment — <a href="https://qz.com/693590/why-the-cheesiest-advertising-trick-in-the-book-still-makes-us-hungry/">scientifically proven</a> to release brain chemicals similar to the ones involved in addiction.</p>
<p>The mozzarella stick is one of the most recognizable formats for this so-called cheese pull. Soft and springy in the middle, crispy and golden on the outside, it calls to mind bowling alleys and school cafeterias of yore.</p>
<p>Recently, the dish has had a cultural resurgence. It makes appearances on high-end restaurant menus and viral cooking videos — driven, perhaps, by Americans’ desire for nostalgic comfort food during a pandemic, or simply the pleasant aesthetics.</p>
<p>Last year, Tim Szuta introduced a baton-size mozzarella stick to increase sales at his pizzeria, <a href="https://www.alphonsostheoriginal.com/Alphonsos/Alphonsos_Main_Page.html">Alphonso’s the Original</a>, in West Allis, Wis. In November 2020, a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/100011072439812/videos/pcb.1255229934856076/1255229038189499">Facebook video</a> of the mozzarella sticks by D’Naya Rae went viral, receiving 24 million views and bringing an influx of customers.</p>
<p>“People love fried foods, people love cheese, and when you take a big fried cheese stick that is from Wisconsin, that draws the people in,” Mr. Szuta, 41, said.</p>
<p>“If it wasn’t for the mozzarella stick, I’d be out of business,” he added.</p>

<p>According to a report from the food delivery company <a href="https://doordash.news/2021/01/26/game-day-eats/">DoorDash</a>, mozzarella sticks were the most-ordered game-day food during the 2020-21 N.F.L. season, outselling even chicken wings. <a href="https://www.bigstickwillys.com/">Big Stick Willy’s</a>, a mozzarella stick wholesale business in New York, currently has back orders equivalent to 18 million pounds of mozzarella sticks. And in January, the James Beard award-nominated chef Dan Kluger opened his long-awaited Long Island City restaurant, <a href="https://www.pennybridgelic.com/">Penny Bridge</a>, serving mozzarella sticks with smoked tomato sauce.</p>
<p>Breading and frying cheese is a centuries-old practice, as seen in dishes like <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1019683-mozzarella-in-carrozza-fried-mozzarella-sandwiches">mozzarella in carrozza</a> and suppli al telefono. The American mozzarella stick — with its hallmark cylindrical shape — most likely came about in the 1970s, when mass-produced mozzarella and commercial deep fryers became available. By the 1980s, the dish was a fixture of many chain restaurants.</p>
<p>But what’s old is new again. Logan Cox calls his restaurant, <a href="https://www.themilkdrunk.com/">Milk Drunk</a>, which opened in Seattle in July 2020, an “upscale Dairy Queen,” and the best-selling item is mozzarella sticks. At Milk Drunk, they’re coated in ranch dressing powder and served with a harissa-spiked marinara.</p>
<p>“I never thought they were going to be as popular as they are,” Mr. Cox, 41, said. “The appeal of melted mozzarella is ubiquitous among all humans.”</p>
<p>Jori Mezuda, 28, a TikTok creator, added that mozzarella sticks are prevalent on social media because they are both broadly familiar and a good canvas for creative experimentation. Her <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@jorimezuda/video/6984584447878270214?lang=en&amp;is_copy_url=1&amp;is_from_webapp=v1">video</a> of mozzarella sticks coated in Flamin’ Hot Cheetos has gotten more than 1 million views.</p>
<p>Guan Wang, who in June opened the Japanese restaurant <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ichiban.ia/?fbclid=IwAR1KrvO99RgbUFk_C82hunE3lKqqQZ_iMsI-kVjpUaq6lU8LHaRuYXgkUuY">Ichiban</a> in Ames, Iowa, makes a riff on a mozzarella stick that’s filled like the Chinese American appetizer <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1022286-crab-rangoon">crab Rangoon</a>.</p>
<figure><img alt="In a nod to his first kitchen job at an Italian restaurant, the chef Andrew Carmellini serves mozzarella sticks at his Manhattan steakhouse Carne Mare — but tops them with caviar." sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/11/03/dining/03MOZZARELLA-STICKS3/28MOZZARELLA-STICKS3-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/11/03/dining/03MOZZARELLA-STICKS3/28MOZZARELLA-STICKS3-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/11/03/dining/03MOZZARELLA-STICKS3/28MOZZARELLA-STICKS3-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/11/03/dining/03MOZZARELLA-STICKS3/28MOZZARELLA-STICKS3-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w"/><figcaption>In a nod to his first kitchen job at an Italian restaurant, the chef Andrew Carmellini serves mozzarella sticks at his Manhattan steakhouse Carne Mare — but tops them with caviar.

<p>The crab Rangoon mozzarella sticks draw in local diners, who often aren’t familiar with East Asian cuisines, Mr. Wang, 29, said. “They are like, ‘They are serving mozzarella sticks, maybe I will try the bento box.’”</p>
<p>The mozzarella stick has also gone vegan. At <a href="https://www.baiasf.com/">Baia</a>, a plant-based restaurant in San Francisco, the dish is made with cashew cheese, tapioca starch and agar. It’s so in demand that even in-person diners had to preorder them online during the first few months of opening last year.</p>
<p>Mike Aurigemma, 49, the director of education for <a href="https://www.matthewkenneycuisine.com/">Matthew Kenney Cuisine</a>, which owns Baia, said that unlike other snack foods, mozzarella sticks can be equally enticing in their fast-food and high-end forms.</p>
<p>Even fine dining chefs have a soft spot for mass-market mozzarella sticks. They remind Andrew Carmellini of being a teenage prep cook at a “high ’80s-style” Italian restaurant outside of Cleveland. The mozzarella sticks Mr. Carmellini, 50, serves today at <a href="https://www.carnemare.com/">Carne Mare</a>, the Manhattan steakhouse he opened last summer, consist of low-moisture mozzarella and panko bread crumbs — similar in makeup to the ones he made as a teenager.</p>
<p>The dish arrives as a pair of golden-brown rods, just like what you might see at a fast-food chain. Except that they come topped with caviar and cost $28.</p>
