<p>Sharp-eyed menu readers might have recently noticed a new <a href="http://www.grubstreet.com/bestofnewyork/best-chicken-nyc.html">pedigreed poultry around town</a>. The Sasso chicken, as it’s called, has quickly become a signature dish at both <a href="http://nymag.com/listings/restaurant/lowlife/">Lowlife</a>, where chef Alex Leonard grills it over binchotan charcoal and shellacs it with an Asian glaze, and <a href="http://nymag.com/listings/restaurant/le-turtle/">Le Turtle</a>, whose chef Greg Proechel brines, hangs, and whole-roasts the bird to a supreme crispness before parading it through the dining room on a pile of smoldering hay. What do these restaurants have in common besides the Sasso? Both chefs worked at <a href="http://nymag.com/listings/restaurant/blanca/">Blanca</a> under Carlo Mirarchi, who first introduced them to this particular strain of poultry, now also found at <a href="http://nymag.com/listings/restaurant/claudette/">Claudette</a>, <a href="http://tessanyc.com/">Tessa</a>, <a href="http://nymag.com/listings/restaurant/brooklyn-fare/">Chef’s Table at Brooklyn Fare</a>, <a href="http://nymag.com/listings/restaurant/atrium-brooklyn/">Atrium Dumbo</a>, and, not coincidentally, <a href="http://nymag.com/listings/restaurant/concord-hill/">Concord Hill</a>, whose opening sous-chef had worked for another Mirarchi adherent, Max Sussman. What exactly is this mystery fowl? A bit of digging around poultry-distribution channels reveals that Sasso is not a breed or a farm but an acronym for Sélection Avicole de la Sarthe et du Sud Ouest, a major player in France’s chicken-breeding business that supplies the genetics for birds reared everywhere from Manila to the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>Sasso’s presence on posh New York plates is owed to the efforts of Jacob Helfrich, second-generation owner of <a href="http://www.watkinspoultry.com/">Watkins Poultry Merchants</a> in East New York, a wholesale distributor to the city’s 80-odd live-animal markets.</p>
