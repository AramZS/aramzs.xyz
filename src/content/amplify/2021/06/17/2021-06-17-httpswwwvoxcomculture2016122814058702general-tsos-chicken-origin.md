title: Why General Tso’s chicken is so popular in America — but not mainland China

<p>General Tso’s chicken is freaking delicious. And thankfully, it’s enormously popular in America’s Chinese restaurants, making it easy to purchase and even get delivered to your door at 1 am on a Saturday.</p>
<p>But you might be surprised to learn that General Tso’s chicken is actually not very big in China — and it doesn’t even originate from mainland China. In fact, it hasn’t even been around for long: Its creation is widely credited to Peng Chang-kuei (who <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-38181144">recently died</a>) in 1952.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bh5piNP9aYE">Great Big Story explained in the video above</a>, the story goes like this: During the Chinese civil war, much of the country’s old political leadership fled to Taiwan in the late 1940s. Peng, the chef to China’s acting president, went with them.</p>
<p>In 1952, Peng was cooking dinner for a visiting diplomatic envoy. He wanted to make something very special. So he made a unique kind of chicken, naming it after General Tso Tsung-t’ang, who is revered in Hunan, Peng’s hometown back in mainland China. (As Peng’s son told Great Big Story, “General Tso's chicken is a symbol of Hunan flavor.”)</p>
<p>After his chicken became a hit in Taiwan, Peng brought the dish to the United States, particularly New York City. It also became a big success here, largely thanks to glowing media coverage about how much then–Secretary of State <a href="http://www.vox.com/world/2016/2/12/10979304/clinton-sanders-kissinger">Henry Kissinger</a> loved it.</p>
<p>As word spread, imitators popped up. They added sugar, sauces, and spices to the dish — to the point that General Tso’s chicken in much of the US doesn’t even taste like the original.</p>
<p>But funnily enough, the recipe never took off in mainland China. So as America and Taiwan gobble it up, much of mainland China doesn’t even know about it.</p>
