  You know how in courtroom dramas an attorney will ask someone if they can

<p>As part of the big case between Apple and Epic, <a data-ga='[["Embedded Url","Internal link","https://kotaku.com/fortnite-made-over-9-billion-between-2018-and-2019-1846814284",{"metric25":1}]]' href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-made-over-9-billion-between-2018-and-2019-1846814284">which after months of shots across the bow began in earnest today</a>, Sweeney was asked by an attorney if he could please identify a number of pieces of key evidence. Just point to the item and describe, if he could recognise them, what they would be to the judge.</p>
<p>He would need to successfully point out all three, of course, if he and Epic were to stand any chance of success in this case, so the pressure was on. And thanks to an audio recording made available of the first day’s proceedings, we’ve been able to listen in on this crucial part of the hearing, in which Sweeney is asked to identify exhibit PX-2777:</p>
<p>“It’s the PlayStation 5"</p>
<p>PX-2778:</p>
<p>“It’s the Xbox series X”</p>
<p>and PX-2776:</p>
<p>“It’s the Nintendo Switch”.</p>
<p>All three answers were correct. The case proceeds.</p>
