<p><strong>EXCLUSIVE</strong>: Add <a data-tag="tom-cruise" href="https://deadline.com/tag/tom-cruise/">Tom Cruise</a> to <a href="https://deadline.com/2021/05/hbo-hollywood-foreign-press-ultimatum-warnermedia-diversity-inclusion-controversy-1234753096/">the chorus of outrage</a> against the Hollywood Foreign Press Association. Deadline hears that the actor today has delivered back to the <a data-tag="hfpa" href="https://deadline.com/tag/hfpa/">HFPA</a> the three Golden Globe trophies he has won over the years.</p>
<p>The trophies just sent to HFPA headquarters are the Best Actor prize he won for<em> Jerry Maguire</em>, the Best Actor prize he won for <em>Born on the Fourth of July</em> and the Best Supporting Actor prize he won for <em>Magnolia</em>. This is a new tack, but I wouldn’t be surprised if others follow his lead and that the reception area of the HFPA could be crammed with golden trophies.</p>
<p>Sources said this just happened, as the <a data-tag="golden-globes" href="https://deadline.com/tag/golden-globes/">Golden Globes</a> house of cards continues to crumble and <a href="https://deadline.com/2021/05/golden-globes-canceled-nbc-2022-hfpa-1234753314/">NBC canceled next year’s broadcast</a>. Cruise becomes the latest star to speak out, including Netflix, Amazon and NBC among others over the slow crawl the organization is making to <a href="https://deadline.com/2021/03/publicists-threaten-withhold-clients-golden-globes-hfpa-no-black-members-1234715262/">reform its lack of diversity</a>.</p>
