title: 'How to use Tailscale + pihole'
---
 
1. install tailscale on everything I can touch (all my devices, all family devices)
2. against one google account (the work google account I pay for)
3. pin certs to not expire for certain devices I care about
4. turn on exit-node for stuff I want to tunnel out of (in this case, ubuntu server that's also pi-hole and plex and etc etc)
5. optionally turn on exit-node for the apple tv(!)
6. auth tailscale on this laptop
7. choose the ubuntu server at home as exit node
