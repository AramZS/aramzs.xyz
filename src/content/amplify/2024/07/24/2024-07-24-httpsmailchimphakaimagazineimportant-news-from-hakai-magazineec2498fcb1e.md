<div><div> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td class="rw-do-not-change"></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="rw-do-not-change" valign="top"><p>Dear Readers,</p> <p><br/> The only way to deliver this bad news is bluntly: <em>Hakai Magazine</em> will cease to publish at the end of 2024. For nearly a decade, we’ve made our cozy berth within the Tula Foundation, voyaging alongside its core missions that conduct long-term ecological research in British Columbia and deliver essential healthcare of Guatemalan mothers and babes. It has been a privilege beyond measure.</p> <p><br/> This journey has been a profound experience for us. Through our work with talented freelance editors, writers, photographers, and videographers, we’ve sailed through realms both familiar and uncharted. Whether diving into the minutiae of marine life or portraying panoramic vistas of oceanic wonder, each tale bore the unmistakable <em>Hakai</em>-take: clarity, accuracy, insight, and a generous splash of literary finesse. Your unwavering support and enthusiasm have been the backbone of our efforts, and for that, we are deeply grateful.</p> <p><br/> No doubt, we are sad. But we have adjusted to the news and we’re committed to finding a new outlet where we can continue to publish stories with our signature keen insight into all things coastal and oceanic. We’re actively looking for new funding sources—if you have ideas, please get in touch, because we’re open to suggestions. Over the next six months, we will keep you informed of our progress in finding a new haven for our next chapter.</p> <p><br/> (Members, I understand that this news will come as a particular shock to you. We will send you a separate email right away with specific information about your upcoming donations.)</p> <p><br/> Although we will no longer be publishing new content at hakaimagazine.com after 2024, the Tula Foundation will support and maintain the <em>Hakai Magazine</em> website in perpetuity, continuing to make our archives freely available to everyone. If you have any questions, thoughts, or want to tell us what you love about <em>Hakai Magazine</em>, please reach out. We value your feedback and would love to hear from you.</p> <p><br/> Thank you for being a part of our community and for making <em>Hakai Magazine</em> a cherished part of your reading experience. We hope to welcome you to our next endeavor soon.</p> <p><br/> With warmest regards,</p> <p>Jude Isabella</p> Founding editor</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div></div>
