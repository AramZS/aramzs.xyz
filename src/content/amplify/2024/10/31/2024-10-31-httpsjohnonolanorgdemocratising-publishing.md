  Ghost is a distributed non-profit foundation which gives away all of its
  intellectual property under a permissive MIT license. The company has no
  investors and, in fact, no owners of any kind. I don't own any part of Ghost,
  and neither does my co-founder Hannah. We currently generate around $7.
