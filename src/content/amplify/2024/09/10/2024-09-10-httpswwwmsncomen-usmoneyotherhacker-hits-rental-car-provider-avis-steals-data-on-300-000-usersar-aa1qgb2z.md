One of the company's data breach notifications also <a href="https://www.iowaattorneygeneral.gov/media/cms/952024_Avis_Rent_A_Car_System_LLC_A7F18A36DEE2B.pdf">shows that</a> the hackers may have obtained numerous personal details from affected customers. </p><p>According to the company’s investigation, the stolen data varies between customers, but “name, mailing address, email address, phone number, date of birth, credit card number and expiration date, and driver’s license numbers” could have been stolen. </p><p>The stolen information can expose affected victims to fraud schemes, making it easy for scammers to make unwanted purchases or register for new loans using the customer’s details. In response, Avis is providing one year of free credit monitoring to affected victims. Users can also consider placing a <a href="https://www.usa.gov/credit-freeze">free credit freeze</a> through the three credit agencies to prevent fraudsters from opening a credit card or loan in their name.  </p><p>Although Avis didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment, the company indicated to Maine’s attorney general that the hack could be sourced to “insider wrongdoing."</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.iowaattorneygeneral.gov/media/cms/952024_Avis_Rent_A_Car_System_LLC_A7F18A36DEE2B.pdf">letter</a> to Iowa residents, the company added: “Since the incident occurred, Avis has worked with cybersecurity experts to develop a plan to enhance security protections for the impacted business application. In addition, Avis has taken steps to deploy and implement additional safeguards onto its systems and is actively reviewing its security monitoring and controls to enhance and fortify the same.”</p>
