  After several years of keeping it going in semi-retired, keep-the-lights-on
  (KTLO) mode, I’ve decided to officially fully retire this blog. The
  ribbonfarm.com domain and all links will remain active, but there will be no
  new content after November 13th, 2024, which happens to be my 50th birthday.
