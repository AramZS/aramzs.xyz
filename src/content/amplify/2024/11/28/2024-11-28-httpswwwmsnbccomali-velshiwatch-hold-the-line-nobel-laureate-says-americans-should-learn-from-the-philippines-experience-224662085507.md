  Donald Trump’s conduct is straight out of the same strongman playbook that
  others have used, and his presidential victory is part of a recent global
  trend of illiberal leaders being elected democratically. “We’re seeing the
  ‘Philippinization’ of America,” says the Filipina journalist and Nobel Peace
  Prize laureate Maria Ressa. “Look at our experience for what’s coming up in
  the days ahead,” she adds, cautioning that what could happen in America has
  already occurred in other countries like the Philippines. There may be tough
  times ahead, but she advises that people should “hold the line” and “stay
  committed to [their] values.”
