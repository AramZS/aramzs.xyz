  Many of us yearn for a return to one golden age or another. But there's a
  community of bloggers taking the idea to an extreme: they want to turn the
  dial way back to the days before the French Revolution. Neoreactionaries
  believe that all the good stuff from the past few centuries come from
  technology and capitalism, and that democracy and social progress have
  actually done more harm than good. They propose a return to old-fashioned
  gender roles, social order and monarchy.
