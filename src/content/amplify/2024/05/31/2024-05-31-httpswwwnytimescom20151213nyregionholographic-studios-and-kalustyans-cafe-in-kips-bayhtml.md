  Kips Bay houses Holographic Studios, perhaps the oldest continuous holographic
  gallery in the world; and the cafe at Kalustyan’s with Middle Eastern, North
  African and Armenian specialties.

<p><i><p><i>By </i>Julie Besonen</p></i></p>
<p>Kips Bay, north of Gramercy Park in Manhattan, was named for an early Dutch farmer, Jacob Kip, and an East River inlet now masked by landfill. Bellevue is its anchor, the oldest continuously operating hospital in the United States, which happens to be two blocks from what is thought to be the oldest continuous gallery of holography in the world, <a href="http://www.holographer.com/">Holographic Studios</a>.</p>
<p>Jason Sapan, who wears a white lab coat stitched with the name of his alter ego, Dr. Laser, founded the museum in 1979 and still displays youthful enthusiasm when describing the trippy scientific art. “In a hologram the size of an average human brain, every recorded document in the history of man can be stored,” he said, sounding every bit as wondrous as Carl Sagan narrating “Cosmos.”</p>
<p>The storefront museum, at 240 East 26th Street, holds more than 200 holograms, some of them in motion, including a staged replay of Lee Harvey Oswald being shot by Jack Ruby in 1963. There’s also Andy Warhol paging through a tabloid in 1976 — for which Warhol posed. The phantom images seem to float and appear three-dimensional without the aid of 3-D glasses. There is a “Star Trek” quality to the technology. Accordingly, one hologram beams U.S.S. Enterprise antagonists: a Klingon, a Ferengi and a member of the Borg.</p>

<p>Holography <a href="http://gizmodo.com/light-waves-and-lasers-a-short-narrated-history-of-hol-1325406631">traces its roots</a> to the 19th century but did not come into use until the 1960s, when the development of the laser made it practical. A hologram is essentially an impression in light, like a mold recording the interference patterns of wave fronts. When light hits the image, it recreates those wave fronts so the resulting image is identical to the original, full-dimensional encoded material.</p>
<p>It is a painstaking, expensive process. “A typical hologram has maybe 10 billion pixels per inch by 3,000 deep,” Mr. Sapan said. “It’s so mind-boggling, so past anything we have in digital.”</p>
