title: 9 Environmental Crimes That Would Make Great Movies

<h2><em>Don't Look Up </em>shows you can make a compelling climate change movie. Here's some more fodder for Hollywood to keep the ball rolling.</h2>

Rather than focusing purely on weird science or Al Gore, it tells a great story by highlighting the criminal inaction on climate change. (Well, technically it’s about a comet headed for Earth, but it’s a clear stand-in for our real-world crisis.)</p>
<p>It’s also not alone in telling a story about climate change in a punchy way this year. <em>Don’t Look Up</em> was preceded this summer with a slightly more subtle climate movie: <a data-ga='[["Embedded Url","Internal link","https://gizmodo.com/no-sudden-move-is-a-surprisingly-anti-pollution-hollywo-1847252600",{"metric25":1}]]' href="https://gizmodo.com/no-sudden-move-is-a-surprisingly-anti-pollution-hollywo-1847252600"><em>No Sudden Move</em></a>, a mob thriller based on a little-known conspiracy by automakers in the 1950s to cover up their own research into air pollution.</p>
<p>It’s great that Hollywood seems to finally be finding ways to break out of the tired old model of telling environmental and climate stories using either heavy-handed storytelling like <a data-ga='[["Embedded Url","Internal link","https://gizmodo.com/the-day-after-tomorrow-oh-god-we-are-all-going-to-die-5955629",{"metric25":1}]]' href="https://gizmodo.com/the-day-after-tomorrow-oh-god-we-are-all-going-to-die-5955629"><em>The Day After Tomorrow</em></a> or bogus sci-fi setups like <a data-ga='[["Embedded Url","Internal link","https://gizmodo.com/geostorms-weather-control-tech-is-exceptionally-bogus-1819783644",{"metric25":1}]]' href="https://gizmodo.com/geostorms-weather-control-tech-is-exceptionally-bogus-1819783644"><em>Geostorm</em></a>. Focusing on inaction or actual crimes puts climate in more concrete terms. While <em>Don’t Look Up </em>is pure fiction, there’s no shortage of real-world examples of climate fuckery to highlight on the silver screen. In the spirit of giving Hollywood some story fodder to keep the momentum going, we’ve compiled a list of environmental crimes and criminals (in both the letter of the law and court of public opinion) that would be great fodder for the next blockbuster. Have at it, movie producers!</p>

<p>If screenwriters are looking for some easy material, the <a data-ga='[["Embedded Url","Internal link","https://gizmodo.com/chevron-is-trying-to-crush-a-prominent-climate-lawyer-a-1844685508",{"metric25":1}]]' href="https://gizmodo.com/chevron-is-trying-to-crush-a-prominent-climate-lawyer-a-1844685508">case of Steven Donziger</a> basically writes itself. Donziger led a case against Chevron on behalf of 30,000 Indigenous people and farmers in the Amazon for widespread pollution of local water and environment. What’s more, he won the Ecuadorian court battle in a dramatic fashion: it was the biggest environmental human rights judgment in history.</p>
<p>Since the ruling, Chevron has refused to pay the ordered fine. Instead, it used the U.S. court system in unprecedented and troubling ways to come after Donziger, using a network of hand-picked and industry-friendly attorneys and judges. Donziger spent two years on house arrest before even facing a trial. The United Nations has gone so far as to call his house arrest illegal under international law and <a data-ga='[["Embedded Url","Internal link","https://gizmodo.com/un-finds-steven-donziger-s-house-arrest-violates-intern-1847773930",{"metric25":1}]]' href="https://gizmodo.com/un-finds-steven-donziger-s-house-arrest-violates-intern-1847773930">called for his release in September</a>.

<p>There was already a (pretty well-received) movie released in 2016 about the Deepwater Horizon disaster itself, starring Mark Wahlberg as a worker aboard the Transocean drilling rig that suffered a catastrophic explosion on April 20, 2010.</p>
<p>However, that movie only covers the blow-by-blow of the day of the explosion on the rig, relegating the aftermath—how only two people were prosecuted, and how the 87-day blowout spilled 210 million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico—to a quick postscript. The film also doesn’t touch the <a data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/15/science/earth/15spill.html",{"metric25":1}]]' href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/15/science/earth/15spill.html">safety shortcuts BP took</a> that federal officials later found contributed to the disaster, nor how the company eventually paid only a fraction of the settlement for the damage it caused <a data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","https://www.wsj.com/articles/BL-MBB-48174",{"metric25":1}]]' href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/BL-MBB-48174">thanks to tax writeoffs</a>.

The brothers started out as managers at their family’s oil refining business and went on to become billionaires. Their corrosive influence on the climate discourse includes being some of the most important funders of denial through their contributions to conservative groups like the Heritage Foundation, the Cato Institute, and Americans for Prosperity.</p>

There’s no better way to portray the way private interests have changed the course of climate politics than following the Kochs’ money—and given how many big political players have taken handouts from them over the past 30 years, it would make a pretty gripping historical biopic.</p>

<p>He pioneered now-standard advertising techniques like disguising paid content as editorial content and having companies sponsor the arts to bolster their public image, not necessarily sell product (Exxon famously sponsored episodes of Masterpiece Theater in the 1970s). Schmertz also fostered particularly aggressive relationships with reporters that helped him get the company’s message across. His ideas not only changed the face of the advertising industry, but also <a data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","https://drillednews.com/the-mobil-oil-flack-who-brought-us-false-equivalence-advertorials-and-corporate-free-speech/",{"metric25":1}]]' href="https://drillednews.com/the-mobil-oil-flack-who-brought-us-false-equivalence-advertorials-and-corporate-free-speech/">shaped</a> how Exxon would do battle with reporters and manipulate science for its own gain in the decades to come. If the producers of <em>Thank You For Smoking</em> are hunting for a follow-up, Schmertz would be a great subject.</p>

<p>In April 2010, just days before the Deepwater Horizon disaster, an explosion at a coal mine in West Virginia killed 29 miners. The disaster was partially as a result of high methane levels in the unventilated mine. In the years after the explosion, a state investigation said the owner of the mine, Massey Energy, <a data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/20/us/20mine.html",{"metric25":1}]]' href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/20/us/20mine.html">squarely to blame</a>, alleging that the company “operated its mines in a profoundly reckless manner, and 29 coal miners paid with their lives for the corporate risk taking.”</p>

<p>Between 1946 and 1958, the U.S. conducted a series of nuclear tests on the Marshall Islands. The country detonated 67 nuclear bombs, wiping away entire islands, and forcing <a data-ga='[["Embedded Url","Internal link","https://gizmodo.com/many-marshall-islands-residents-still-cant-go-home-afte-1781835336",{"metric25":1}]]' href="https://gizmodo.com/many-marshall-islands-residents-still-cant-go-home-afte-1781835336">hundreds of people to evacuate</a>. Before the U.S. left, it and the Marshall Islands reached an agreement for the former not to hold the latter responsible for any after-effects of the tests. But the U.S. <a data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","https://www.latimes.com/projects/marshall-islands-nuclear-testing-sea-level-rise/",{"metric25":1}]]' href="https://www.latimes.com/projects/marshall-islands-nuclear-testing-sea-level-rise/">withheld various pieces of information</a> about what it had done on the islands, including the fact that it had imported some of its own nuclear waste to store there. Sea level rise is now threatening some of those waste facilities.</p>
<p>Nuclear weapons have already made compelling fodder for movies from <em>Dr. Strangelove</em> to various spy movies like <em>Mission Impossible.</em> There’s no reason a historical account couldn’t add to the oeuvre.</p>

<p>There have been plenty of movies about the war that has defined generations of Americans. Hollywood has spun out any number of narratives about the Iraq War from the glorified heist movie <em>Three Kings</em> to the <a data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cross-check/what-war-propaganda-like-8220-american-sniper-8221-reveals-about-us/",{"metric25":1}]]' href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cross-check/what-war-propaganda-like-8220-american-sniper-8221-reveals-about-us/">glorified propaganda</a> of <em>American Sniper.</em></p>
<p>But none have fully delved into the way oil played a central role in the war planning and attempts to privatize the oil sector after the invasion—or the aftermath and how oil continues to factor into struggles in the region to this day.
