  After 3 Decades Notepad Can’t Still Be The Answer, Can It? – Interdependent
  Thoughts

<p>Over in the IndieWeb community we were having a conversation about how easy it should be for people to create their own websites (also for small local businesses etc.) Where making the site is basically <em>the same</em> as writing the text you want to put on it. Social media silos do that for you, but out on the open web?</p>
<p><a href="https://aaronparecki.com/">Aaron</a> mentioned that one a tech conference, someone had a <a href="https://linktr.ee/">linktree</a> site on the last slide for people to find more info, because it was the easiest way apparently to make a small site just for that info, by using a third party silo.<br/>
<a href="http://tantek.com/">Tantek</a> then said that is a good summary of the use case:</p>
<p>Seeing that single line on my screen, I was mildly shocked that my own first instinctive answer to “easiest way to make a small site” is “write my own html in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Notepad">Notepad</a>“. That answer is almost 30 years old, it’s how I made my very first web page. And handwriting html is still my first answer! No other path immediately comes to mind. Of course, I wouldn’t want to hand write this weblog in html, but ‘small site’ as in a few simple pages, yes, I would do that by hand in some plain text app like Notepad.</p>
<p>Can it be that three decades on the closest answer to ‘making a website is as easy as making a plain text note’ is still hand written html? <a href="http://scripting.com">Dave Winer</a> uses an outliner to blog, and more recently created <a href="http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/about.opml">Drummer</a> for the rest of us, that for him at least means blogging is as simple as writing plain text. I can post to this blog from my plain text notes on my laptop (<a href="https://www.zylstra.org/blog/2022/01/a-second-md-to-html-post/">from Obsidian using micropub</a>), but I use markdown to style it a bit. What else is out there?</p>
<p>Can making your web page be as simple as writing a note you put on the door or in the window of your business?<br/>
 The answer can’t really still be Notepad, can it?</p>
