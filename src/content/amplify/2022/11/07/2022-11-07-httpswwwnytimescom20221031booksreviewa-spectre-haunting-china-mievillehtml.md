  China Miéville argues that "The Communist Manifesto" is still relevant today
  in his nonfiction work "A Spectre, Haunting." He explores the manifesto's
  impact on present-day struggles and addresses criticisms while emphasizing its
  importance in guiding modern movements. Miéville seeks to unify the left by
  showing how differences can be synthesized into a powerful movement without
  compromising priorities.

<p><strong>A SPECTRE, HAUNTING: On “The Communist Manifesto,”</strong> by China Miéville</p>
<p>“The way to tell if a fantasy novel was written by a Marxist,” an observant person once said, “is that it gets the ratio of peasants to lords right, while the bourgeois variety is off by orders of magnitude.”</p>
<p>China Miéville is a fantasy writer and a Marxist. On both scores, his bona fides are beyond reproach: Since 1998, he’s published a string of best-selling, prizewinning, critically acclaimed fantasy novels of the so-called <a href="https://bookriot.com/new-weird-genre/">New Weird</a> tendency, including the “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/21/books/game-of-thrones-books.html?searchResultPosition=1">Perdido Street Station</a>” trilogy and his breakout novel “The City and the City,” which was adapted for British television.</p>
<p>As for Marxism, Miéville’s dissertation in international relations, “Between Equal Rights: A Marxist Theory of International Law,” was published by Haymarket in 2006, and he was the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1369363.stm">Socialist Alliance candidate for British Parliament</a> for a district in central London in the 2001 election. (He lost to the Labour candidate.)</p>
<p>It is technically possible to be familiar with only one of these aspects of Miéville’s career, but it would require an act of will. His fantasy novels are shot through with class struggle, and in ways that are integral to the narratives. Novels like “King Rat” (1998) aren’t gripping phantasmagoric thrill rides <em>despite</em> their politics; rather, it’s the politics that imbues them with so much excitement and conflict. It turns out that class war is a hell of a plot device. (Full disclosure: I have been a speaker at several literary conventions at which Miéville also spoke and once appeared with him on a panel. I have also had dinner with him.)</p>
<p>But for all that Miéville’s literary and political vocations can’t be easily separated, it’s still rare for him explicitly to merge them. That changed in 2017, when he published “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/07/books/tell-us-5-things-about-your-book-china-mieville-on-the-russian-revolution.html?searchResultPosition=2">October: The Story of the Russian Revolution</a>,” an account of the revolutionary ferment in the yearlong run-up to the 1917 revolution. If the incidents “October” described were fictional, it would be a superb novel on par with any of Miéville’s others. That it is a work of history, one that is rigorous and faithful to the events of that time, makes it all the more remarkable.</p>

<p>Miéville’s latest book, “A Spectre, Haunting: On ‘The Communist Manifesto,’” is also a work of nonfiction, but it is not novelistic. Billed as an “introduction” to the manifesto — though it is substantially longer than the work itself — it is brilliant, even dazzling, if also esoteric, closer in style to Miévelle’s academic writing than to his published fiction and nonfiction.</p>
<p>It’s been 174 years since Marx and Engels first published the “Manifesto,” and during the intervening decades it has accumulated a vast corpus of commentary, while continuing to win converts, thanks to its moral clarity, thundering language and incisive analysis. This despite its most glaring defect, because, of course, the “Manifesto”’s chief prediction — the imminent downfall of capitalism — was dead wrong. It has also won accolades from some of capitalism’s most ardent defenders (including <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/1826126">the economist Joseph Schumpeter</a>, whose theory of “creative destruction” is integral to the ethos of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/sep/24/disruption-big-tech-buzzword-silicon-valley-power">Silicon Valley start-ups</a>).</p>
<p>Miéville sets out to prove that the work is no historical curiosity — that it remains relevant today, not merely as a foil for arguments about Marxism’s role in previous struggles but as a vital guide to present-day ones. Over the course of six densely argued chapters, he grapples with both criticisms of the “Manifesto” and the revolutions it has inspired. He is scrupulous in setting out the arguments against the work, making each case as forcefully as he can. Then, having done the critics justice, he counters each one with a mix of historical context (pointing out, for example, where Marx later added nuance to his position), historical precedent (indicating where radical movements have successfully deployed the reasoning and tactics the “Manifesto” proposes) and, where warranted, frank admissions of weaknesses that time has rendered inarguable (including, for example, the failure of the “Manifesto”’s predicted “world literature” to emerge).</p>
<p>He untangles the seemingly contradictory accusations from leftist commentators that Marx and Engels underestimated the power of capitalism to adapt to changing circumstances, or, alternatively, lavished undue praise on capitalism’s inventiveness. Miéville reconciles these conflicting claims. On the one hand, he argues, Marx and Engels didn’t believe that capitalism’s imminent collapse was inevitable; they thought that <em>promising</em> such a collapse could trigger a mass movement that would precipitate it. (Miévelle asks us to understand the “Manifesto”’s various assertions as “claim, prediction or exhortation.”) On the other hand, he says, Marx and Engels’s paeans to capitalism’s ingenuity reflected a string of stunning capitalist victories over feudalism, and both writers later added caveats reflecting their changing views on the subject.</p>
<p>Other topics Miéville addresses include how to view the “Manifesto” within the context of the Global South (Marx deplored the slave trade, Miéville points out, and in later writings called for solidarity between European workers and colonized people the world over); within movements for gender and racial equality (Marx failed to grapple with the women’s rights struggle of his day, Miéville concedes, arguing that gender must be added to class “to better understand class, gender and capitalism” together); and in the midst of the climate emergency (Marx’s analysis shows capitalism’s inability to address the problem, suggesting that a capitalist regime would first deny it and then seek to remediate it with ineffective, market-based measures); and in light of authoritarian states from the U.S.S.R. to China that have waved the “Manifesto” as their banners (demonstrating, Miéville contends, that authoritarian “socialism from above” has no basis in the work).</p>
<p>Clearly Miéville’s goal isn’t merely to provide an introduction to Marx and Engels’s remarkable little pamphlet. Rather, he seeks to unify a demoralized, disarrayed left that wants badly to stand athwart the looming crises of environmental collapse, rampant inequality, rising authoritarianism and, now, nuclear Armageddon. Ultimately, “A Spectre, Haunting” is Miéville’s case against leftist factionalism. He wants to show how differences might be synthesized into a powerful movement without its various members having to compromise on their priorities. His final chapter, on revolutionary hatred and revolutionary love, urges readers to cultivate “comfort with contradiction,” to abandon ideological certainty in favor of “a ‘band’ or ‘zone’ of reasonable understandings and approaches” and, finally, to “hate harder than did the ‘Manifesto,’ for the sake of humanity.” As he explains: “Who would we be not to hate this system, and its partisans? If we don’t, the hate of those who hate on its behalf will not ebb.”</p>
<p>As a call to arms, though, “A Spectre, Haunting” is drier and more cerebral than the “Manifesto” itself. In form, it belongs to the long, leftist debate over revolutionary action, a debate that has become all the more urgent as capitalism threatens to roast and flood our world, if it doesn’t incinerate it in a radioactive cloud first. For readers who have followed this debate, “A Spectre, Haunting” will be revelatory and dazzling, as Miéville finds commonalities among ostensibly incompatible positions and solidarity amid divisions. His “Communist Manifesto” is the inspiration for a very big tent, one where class and race, gender, ability, sexuality and origins are all part of a single revolutionary movement, not ceding priority to one another, but insisting that no liberation worth its name would exclude any of these elements<em>.</em> It’s an appealing, if challenging, vision, and my copy of<em> “</em>A Spectre, Haunting” is already dog-eared and underlined, the hallmarks of a book that demands revisiting.</p>
