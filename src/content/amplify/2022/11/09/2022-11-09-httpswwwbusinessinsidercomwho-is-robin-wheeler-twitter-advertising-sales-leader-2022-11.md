<ul> <li>Twitter executive Robin Wheeler is leading the company's global ad sales teams.</li> <li>She appeared in an "Advertiser Town Hall" on Twitter Spaces with Musk on Wednesday afternoon.</li> <li>Advertisers have expressed frustration about the lack of solid information about Twitter's future.</li> </ul>
<p><em>This story was originally published November 9. Robin Wheeler was <a data-analytics-post-depth="40" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-floats-bankruptcy-in-first-twitter-staff-meeting-2022-11">reported to be one of the many Twitter execs that resigned Thursday</a>. Wheeler later tweeted that <a data-analytics-post-depth="40" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" href="https://twitter.com/robinw/status/1590882131471126528?s=12&amp;t=KHGMm3Nm9-KNwX6WdYDjcg">she was still at the company</a>. </em></p>
<p>When Twitter's new owner Elon Musk addressed <a data-analytics-post-depth="40" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-meets-to-reassure-twitter-advertisers-on-brand-safety-video-2022-11">a virtual meeting of more than 100 advertisers and agency executives last Thursday</a> to assuage their concerns about his takeover, he was flanked by a long-time Twitter employee far more familiar to the advertising community.</p>
<p>Robin Wheeler, who most-recently held the title of vice president of US client solutions, again took center stage with Musk on an "Advertiser Town Hall," on Twitter Spaces on Wednesday afternoon in which he answered questions about his future vision for the platform. More than 100,000 Twitter users tuned in</p>
<p>He said brands should feel assured that Twitter remains a good place to advertise on and that his move toward verifying more users through an $8-a-month subscription would help the platform in its "vigorous pursuit of the truth" by attempting to weed out bad actors. He also said that Twitter would work hard to improve the relevance of ads on the platform.</p>
<p>Advertisers are still concerned that <a data-analytics-post-depth="40" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-meets-to-reassure-twitter-advertisers-on-brand-safety-video-2022-11">relaxed content moderation policies could make Twitter a dangerous environment for their brands</a>, and Musk has also signaled that he wants <a data-analytics-post-depth="40" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-all-of-twitter-behind-a-paywall-report-says-2022-11">Twitter less dependent on advertising revenue.</a></p>
<p>Major advertisers such as <a data-analytics-post-depth="40" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/companies-ads-twitter-advertising-elon-musks-takeover-2022-11">General Motors, Pfizer, and General Mills have paused spending</a> on the platform.</p>
<p>Wheeler's challenge to keep advertisers on board is hampered further by the fact that 25% of Twitter's ad sales team was impacted by the company's layoffs last week, according to a person familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>Wheeler isn't as well-known in the industry as some of her ad sales counterparts who recently departed Twitter, including Chief Customer Officer Sarah Personette, VP of Americas JP Maheu, VP Global Business Partners Stephanie Prager. But she is now de facto Twitter ad sales chief, and those who know her say she's used to navigating complex problems. A keen golfer and mom of identical twin girls, her claimed life mantra couldn't be more apt for the current situation: "Mind over matter — anything is achievable."</p>
<p>Twitter and Wheeler didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>
<h2><strong>Advertisers describe a sales team hampered by an information vacuum as Musk unleashes chaos through his tweets</strong></h2>
<p>One of Wheeler's biggest tasks is getting a depleted ad sales team organized and running. These top ad sales staffers include Meg Haley, VP of revenue product specialists; AJ Brown, global manager of monetization integrity; and Chris Riedy, the company's vice president for the EMEA region.</p>
<p>Advertising executives who interacted recently with Twitter's remaining ad sales team described them as hamstrung by an absence of information, decision-making power and, one source said, without access to some important documents like client contracts.</p>
<p>Three sources said they were also frustrated with Twitter's lack of direct answers to their probing questions. Instead, these sources said, Twitter had indicated its new direction by providing daily email updates pointing to recent tweets from Musk and its <a data-analytics-post-depth="60" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" href="https://twitter.com/yoyoel">head of safety and integrity Yoel Roth</a>.</p>
<p>"There's a Twitter business website — fricking use it guys, use it," said one advertising executive.</p>
<p>These summaries are also sanitized, sources said. They noted that while Musk had appeared to <a data-analytics-post-depth="80" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-meets-to-reassure-twitter-advertisers-on-brand-safety-video-2022-11">say all the right things regarding brand safety in meetings</a>, his persona on the Twitter platform has painted an entirely different picture.</p>

<p>This week Musk had suggested that <a data-analytics-post-depth="80" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" href="https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/elon-musk-tortious-interference-twitter-boycotts/">Twitter would launch a tortious interference claim</a> against activist groups that had called for advertisers to boycott the platform. He threatened to "<a data-analytics-post-depth="80" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-name-shame-advertisers-who-pull-budget-2022-11">thermonuclear name and shame</a>" advertisers that have pressed pause. And <a data-analytics-post-depth="80" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-name-shame-advertisers-who-pull-budget-2022-11">Musk blocked, and later unblocked, marketing and media veteran Lou Paskalis</a> after he called him out for laying off members of the company's content moderation team.</p>
<h2><strong>From AOL to Twitter, Wheeler has managed sales teams in crisis before</strong></h2>
<p>Wheeler has operated successfully in chaotic environments before.</p>
<p>"Robin is highly respected by those of us who have had the opportunity to work closely with her over the years," said Paskalis, the marketing executive who was briefly blocked by Musk on Twitter this month.</p>
<p>She started at ad agency TBWA\Chiat\Day, then moved to the publisher side, working in sales roles at US News &amp; World Report, Time Inc., and AOL.</p>
<p>At AOL, she had to manage a team and a large client base through tough company transitions, said marketing and tech consultant Matt Prohaska, who worked with Wheeler at AOL 15 years ago. Leadership at the company was constantly under fire after it acquired six companies in 18 months but struggled to integrate them.</p>
<p>But Wheeler led through the period by focusing the sales pitch on marketing objectives, the editorial environment, and audience size, Prohaska said. "There are few executives that have been through anything as close to this as Robin, and Twitter is fortunate to have her there," he added.</p>
<p>She joined Twitter in 2012, managing relationships with some of the company's largest clients such as Coca-Cola, Google, and Procter &amp; Gamble.</p>
<p>In 2020, she become the commercial lead for MoPub, Twitter's ad network that helped publishers and app developers sell mobile ads. A person familiar with her thinking at the time said Wheeler was concerned about how technical the role might be, but her brand advertising experience helped "humanize MoPub to the world," this source said. Twitter <a data-analytics-post-depth="100" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/twitter-completes-sale-of-mopub-to-applovin-for-1-05-bln-in-cash-quick-facts-1031074267">sold the asset to adtech firm AppLovin for $1 billion</a> last year.</p>
<blockquote data-cards="" data-conversation="" data-lang="en">—Robin Wheeler  (@robinw) <a data-analytics-post-depth="100" href="https://twitter.com/mims/statuses/1589020140502675456?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 5, 2022</a></blockquote>
<p>But Wheeler is now working in what's arguably her toughest environment yet, even compared to the tumult of AOL.</p>
<p>Prior to Musk's takeover, Twitter was still only the 12th-biggest digital ad seller worldwide, far behind Google, Meta, and Amazon in revenue, and many advertisers did not consider it a must-buy. Now even those tech giants, along with Twitter, are facing <a data-analytics-post-depth="100" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/the-ad-industry-is-preparing-for-an-economic-disaster-2022-10">a sharp deceleration in the advertising market</a>as global economies face recession and as Russia's invasion on Ukraine continues to impact supply chains.</p>
<p>"I certainly wouldn't want that job," said one advertising agency veteran.</p>
