  The report found just five of the world’s leading emitters of greenhouse gases
  caused $6 trillion in global economic losses through warming caused by their
  emissions from 1990 to 2014.

<p>The United States and China, the world’s two leading greenhouse gas emitters, are each responsible for more than $1.8 trillion of global income losses from 1990 to 2014, according to a new study that links the emissions in individual countries to the economic impacts of climate change in others. The report may bolster the scientific basis for legal claims for losses tied to global warming.</p>
