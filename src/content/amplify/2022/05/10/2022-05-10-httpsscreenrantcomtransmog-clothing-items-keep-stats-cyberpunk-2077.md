<p>V, the protagonist of <em><strong><a href="https://screenrant.com/tag/cyberpunk-2077/">Cyberpunk 2077</a></strong></em>, is meant to be a cool character with a cool look. Like in most RPGs, in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, players can equip clothing and armor for V. Unfortunately, many fans have noticed that <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>'s clothing options force players to make a difficult choice between protection and improved stats or looking cool. Much of the high-level, high-stat armor pieces don't go together, so for a player to reap the benefits of all those stat boosts, they need to get comfortable looking ridiculous. This happens to violate one of the key concepts of the 1988 <em>Cyberpunk </em><a href="https://screenrant.com/cyberpunk-2077-tabletop-rpgs-better-instead-shadowrun-red/">tabletop RPG that <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> is based on</a>, which calls for Style over Substance in appearance and action. Players may be looking for a way to make V both powerful and stylish.</p>

<p>Many RPGs allow players to transmogrify their armor and clothing. This means players can hide certain items, like helmets, or exchange the appearance of one piece of armor with another. This maintains all stat bonuses and armor values of the original piece while allowing it to look better or match other items in the set. Unfortunately, <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> does not currently support transmog in the traditional sense. Players are only able to <a href="https://screenrant.com/cyberpunk-2077-more-crafting-components-guide/">upgrade their armor through the crafting system</a>, and there is no way to dye items either. There is one way for players to work around this, however, and while it isn't perfect, it can at least prevent V from looking entirely mismatched. Here's how to work around the inability to transmog in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>.</p>

<p>Players will need to wait until at least <a href="https://screenrant.com/cyberpunk-2077-how-many-acts/">Act 2 of <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>'s main campaign</a> to have the chance to use the transmog workaround. This workaround requires players to use the "Special" clothing slot in their inventory. Here, players can place full-body clothing items, like jumpsuits, that will visually cover all other equipment V wears. Though the outer appearance will only match the full-body clothing item, all the items equipped under it still register, and V will still receive the stat bonuses for those items.</p>
<p>The first full-body piece of clothing players will receive and keep comes from Act 2. These are the bandages V will be wrapped in at the beginning of the Act. While this may not allow players to design V's look exactly as they might like, it will prevent them from looking as ridiculous as they might with the mismatched, high-stat items.</p>
<p>To work around the inability to transmog, players have also begun <a href="https://screenrant.com/best-mods-cyberpunk-2077-install-guide/">creating and using mods</a>. For fans who play <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> on PC, this can be a viable option as well. There has been no word from developer CD Projekt Red about plans to add this feature to the base game in future updates.</p>
