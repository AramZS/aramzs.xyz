So I wanted to set up the Amplified type on this site. To do that I wanted to export the links from Pocket that I've saved and have them replicated here as the source of this feed. 

Thankfully, Pocket support [was very responsive](https://twitter.com/pocketsupport/status/1769067862419730454). I really hope they add more rich functionality to their export options in the future but this basic data works for now. 

Getting the HTML file is pretty easy, you can pull it [from the Pocket export page](https://getpocket.com/export) when you are signed in. 

## What to do with the file once you have it? 

You could just throw the HTML file up there I suppose. Nothing wrong with that.
