I really want to emphasize this: ChatGPT doesn't have a right to read because it doesn't read. ChatGPT doesn't hallucinate because it doesn't see. ChatGPT isn't lying to you because it does not make decisions. These Machine Learning systems have many things that they could be used for, they could be good at, but replacing search engines isn't actually one of them.
