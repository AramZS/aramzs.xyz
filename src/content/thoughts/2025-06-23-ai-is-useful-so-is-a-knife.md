There have been a few debates about if [ChatGPT-style Large Language Model systems, popularly called AI,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUrOxh_0leE) are "useful" online. As others have already ably noted, this is fundamentally the wrong question to ask for a lot of reasons. 

There's an additional question to ask, even of the most effective and functional AI. Let's leave [the environmental, IP and ethical questions to others](https://context.center/topics/generative-ai-and-chatgpt/) for now. I've tried out a few different LLMs and their tools for helping to write and analyze code. The conclusion I've reached is that "useful" is not a very effective question for analyzing them. 

The problem is that what is useful for one person may not be useful to another. A knife is useful, but it isn't useful in the same way to everyone, nor is it useful to everyone. I know how to use a knife for some things. I can cut vegetables or meat. I can use a knife to dice, slice, mince, chop or cube. I can't, however, juggle a knife. Some people can juggle knives, and some people might learn to juggle knives, but I'm not going to pick up a knife tomorrow and juggle it. I'm not going to start doing [teppanyaki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teppanyaki) knife tricks either. 

This is the key question, what are you trying to use AI for, and what are you skilled at doing? Any LLM is fundamentally a system made--at best--for experts.
