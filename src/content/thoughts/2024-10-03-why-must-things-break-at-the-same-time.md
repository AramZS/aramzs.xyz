Very frustrated that within the same week my process for grabbing data from pocket via the export feature stopped working (I have too many Pocket bookmarks apparently) and Clippings.io, my tool for pulling Kindle highlight exports, also stopped rendering whole JSON files for some reason. 

Gotta figure out how to hit the Pocket API now instead. 

I'm also trying out Readwise to export my highlights on the advice of friend and coworker [David Pham](https://davidchicopham.com/). 

Why must they both hit at once?!?!?!
