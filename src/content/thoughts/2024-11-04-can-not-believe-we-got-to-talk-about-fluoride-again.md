Somehow it appears the debate over the safety of water fluoridation has exploded again, thanks to RFK Jr.'s irresponsible bullshit. 

I've built out a Context Check on the topic in response, for anyone to use. [Here's a reference sheet for understanding and providing references on the positive health benefits, and lack of negative health benefits, involved with water fluoridation](https://context.center/topics/water-fluoridation-iq-health-check/).

LMK if you see any major sources missing or have feedback!
