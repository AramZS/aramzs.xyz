An [open question to me on a locked GitHub thread](https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/11523#issuecomment-3190192571).

> Help me understand this though. When I click on this RSS feed (https://feeds.buzzsprout.com/231452.rss), I get an HTML web page. It has CSS styling (which devtools can't seem to correctly find, because of the XSLT), and uses HTML <audio> elements pointing to the raw MP3 feeds from the RSS reader. Nothing on that page takes me to a podcast reader or anything else, unless I missed it. How does this differ from just publishing that HTML file directly? I mean for the user. The current experience is that you present a link to the user that goes to XML, some tech in the browser transforms that XML into an HTML website, the website is then displayed to the user, and they read it without knowing any of that happened. All of that is possible without all of the intermediate steps, right?

[An example](https://hazardpodcast.com/rss/podcast/index.xml) of a styled feed that I feel better illuminates my earlier point. I made this one, sorry to self promote.
