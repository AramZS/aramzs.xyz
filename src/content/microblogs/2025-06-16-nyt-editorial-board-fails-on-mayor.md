The truly amazing part of [this](https://bsky.app/profile/waldo.net/post/3lrqcsnqtvs2v) is the editorial manages to pull a bunch of law and order bullshit, lead with the idea that too few people paying bus fare is the cities biggest problem and then call Mamdani an unqualified elitist, which is tremendous bullshit.

Glad NYT came out of its local endorsements shell to be like 'Cuomo may have sexually assaulted some people and murdered olds in their nursing homes with COVID but he's the only one with good realistic policies, take from that what you will'

Remember, in journalistic writing, even editorials, the order is extremely important so the fact that they made sure to try and sink Mamdani before addressing any other candidate in the primary is pretty telling about what their objectives are here!

Remember when we used to care about what political candidates did in the years before the moment they announced they were running for an office? I sure miss those days.

Come the fk on. I see what you're doing here.

Basically all but telling new yorkers to not rank Mamdani but rank Cuomo. Terrible opinion.

I really recommend, [if you are unsure who to rank, go to The City's interactive quiz to help you decide](https://projects.thecity.nyc/meet-your-mayor-2025-election-quiz-candidates/). It is much much better than a bunch of editorial boards that are pissed someone might get elected who doesn't call them up regularly

Also, here's [a good hed on this](https://www.indignity.net/the-times-endorses-sexual-harassment/).
