title: Don't trust the human slop telling you how much of the web is AI slop
description: Is a lot of the web algorithmically created content? Possibly! But don't share the argument that's trying to sell you on creating more fake content.

There's a post going around that is claiming that AI has overtaken human writing on the internet. Its central claim is that this is because ChatGPT and a phenomenon that started in mid-2022. Less commonly reported is that the post is PR by a company that wants to use [the image of inevitability](https://tomrenner.com/posts/llm-inevitabilism/?__readwiseLocation=) to sell you AI. 

I'm [something of a the-internet-is-fake expert myself](https://tweets.aramzs.com/1078003966863200256/) so I can pretty confidently tell you that this article is bullshit in a number of different ways.

Look, if you're not an expert you wouldn't know, but this chart is clearly incorrect. Here's how I can tell: they could not possibly measure this at all right now. Why?

{% image 'src/images/ai-generated-content-fake-chart-stamped.png' 'A bad chart attempting to show that ChatGPT is why there is now more AI generated content than human content starting in 2022 that is stamped as fake' 'in-post-gif center-in-text' %}

1. You cannot tell for sure that content is AI generated. [There's no reliable automated way to detect AI generated text, as has been noted by multiple publications](https://context.center/topics/generative-ai-and-chatgpt/#ai-detecting-ai). 
2. You're not counting the [many](https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/multiple-ai-companies-bypassing-web-standard-scrape-publisher-sites-licensing-2024-06-21/) sites that [are](https://www.fastly.com/blog/the-truth-about-blocking-ai-and-how-publishers-can-still-win) [blocking](https://www.wired.com/story/cloudflare-blocks-ai-crawlers-default/) [crawlers](https://www.niemanlab.org/2025/07/cloudflare-will-block-ai-scraping-by-default-and-launches-new-pay-per-crawl-marketplace/) now.

But there's an even more important reason...

Automated text generation has existed for decades. "[Dead internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Internet_theory)" is a conspiracy that got popular back in 2016. [Markov chain text generation dates to at least 1984](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain#Markov_text_generators). The incentives to algorithmically generate web text have been around since before 2010. Huge swaths of the internet have been made-for-seo/[advertising](https://www.admonsters.com/what-are-made-for-advertising-mfa-sites-and-why-are-they-a-scourge-on-ad-tech-and-sustainability/) slop for decades; either using mediocre text generation models or just low paid humans. NYMag in 2018: "[Studies generally suggest that, year after year, less than 60 percent of web traffic is human](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/12/how-much-of-the-internet-is-fake.html)."

This is **inevitability propaganda**, by an AI company named "Graphite", made to make you feel like you must use AI. It's bullshit! This methodology is bullshit, for many reasons, not least of which is: it is reliant on Common Crawl, now [blocked](https://www.niemanlab.org/2025/07/cloudflare-will-block-ai-scraping-by-default-and-launches-new-pay-per-crawl-marketplace/) by many of the biggest content producers online

If this was a real study it would be published in a real journal not <a href="https://graphite.io/five-percent/more-articles-are-now-created-by-ai-than-humans" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a fking press release on the AI company's site</a>. They don't even have the confidence in their theory to do what a lot of other AI companies do and commission real university scientists to run it. Or put it in a preprint! 

The people who wrote this study are, at best, fully incompetent! "Since the large-scale adoption of AI tools began with ChatGPT, we argue that, with high probability, articles published before the release of ChatGPT were written by humans"

[Hahahaha](https://jezebel.com/the-team-of-men-behind-rachel-brewson-the-fake-woman-w-1787270300).

No algorithmically generated content existed on the internet before ChatGPT? [Lol](https://tweets.aramzs.com/1078003966863200256/) 

[Haha](https://tweets.aramzs.com//810698714285309953/)

[Lol](https://tweets.aramzs.com/1051865641026772994/)

[Rofl](https://tweets.aramzs.com/735600709375262721/)

Do not write about or share this study! Don't give these AI bullshit artists what they want.
