You know a thing that is very bad about [this](https://bsky.app/profile/gbbranstetter.bsky.social/post/3madz2uotxs2t)? This is the anti-trans playbook being played against women. Start with 'has the x movement failed the people it's supposed to help', then infantilize them, then make the case they can't be responsible for their own choices, then take their rights away

Insane to me that Bari Weiss, a married Jewish lesbian, is so greedy and/or foolish that she can't see that she's putting the nation's foot on a path that--if she's successful--will destroy her and people like her.

The answer is: people have personal, political, and bodily autonomy. If a movement has meaningfully helped them accomplish that then it is good. If you are proposing to take that away from them because you are asserting they somehow can't be trusted to make their own right choices then you are bad.

I think the playbook prob is much older than I'm implying here actually. It's one of the exact same argument sequences the Confederacy made to preserve slavery too. It's the same playbook that gets used to oppress groups of people everywhere.

It's just this particular approach, flavor and design is basically exactly the same strategy that was just used in the UK and the US against trans people. [A reminder you shouldn't need that trans rights are human rights](https://aramzs.xyz/microblogs/the-democrats-must-defend-trans-people/).
