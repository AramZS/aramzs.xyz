The increasing instances of the international right just straight up referencing naz* shit is incredibly dangerous. But also it's incredibly pitiful. Like the American right's obsession with the Confederacy, it's obsessing over losers, they lost. They lose over and over. It's embarrassing for them.

Imagine you could choose anything or anyone to represent yourself and you base your entire identity off the geopolitical equivalent of the Washington Generals. Sad for right-wingers, if they were't hateful shitheads.
