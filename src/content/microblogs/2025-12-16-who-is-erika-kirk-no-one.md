["Bari Weiss’ much-hyped CBS News town hall with Erika Kirk was a massive ratings flop"](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/bari-weiss-erika-kirk-cbs-news-ratings-b2885768.html#Echobox=1765915715)

Erika Kirk is not a celebrity. She's a no one who no one wants to watch on TV. 'Was married to a guy who barely made the mainstream press until he died' is not a celebrity-making situation.

I think Charlie Kirk, unfortunately, had a massive impact & without him we prob would not have Trump. That said, his usefulness was predicated on his engagement w/ college campuses bringing young people into MAGA. His credibility there was dependent on not being mainstream. He wasn't a celeb either.

The attempt to make him a celeb is prob the furthest MAGA has ever gotten from their broad base in a major public event. It looked bad and cringe and confused normal people who had no idea who Kirk was. Attempting to prop up his totally never-in-public wife as a celeb in his wake is even dumber.

Let's be honest, Charlie Kirk thought women should stay in the kitchen and he was uninterested in creating or engaging with even semi-famous conservative women. I don't care or respect him or his opinion, but if he was still alive to have it you could guarantee he wouldn't want his wife on TV

The end result of all this is the people who knew and liked Charlie Kirk don't want to engage with her. The MAGA/N*zi core he affiliated w/don't respect her. The rest of the audience has no idea who she is. Only Bari would be so unable to read the room as to make her a prime time interview.

As far as I can tell, even Fox has realized she has all the pull of a wet tissue. But not Bari, last to get the useless interview everyone else has already gotten from a lady with almost nothing to say and no particular audience following her.

Weiss's threat to CBS is less that she will turn it conservative and more that she is so unable to identify a news peg that she's end up crashing it into a total lack of viewers with her "instinct".

This is generally true about most of the attempts to shift American media more conservative. The problem is that the right wing audience already has a group of people it watches and those people have spent the last 20 years talking about how mainstream media is satan. You're not getting them.
