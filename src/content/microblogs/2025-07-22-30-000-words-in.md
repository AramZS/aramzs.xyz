Thus far it has been an extremely busy year for me professionally and an insane year in world events so it was really cool to see [on my stats page](https://aramzs.xyz/stats/) that as of my last post, I hit 30,000 words written on this blog. 

Now, a lot of those words may not have been mine, I'm a liberal user of block quotes on here, but even with all that in mind, it feels like a real accomplishment. It makes me happy to write more frequently again and it feels good in this time of worldwide crappiness to put words on my own record on a variety of topics. It's a nice round number (as is the count of 70 posts, one more than I wrote all last year) and I'm very glad to note it. It also has been accompanied by continual coding on a bunch of fronts, but especially this site.

It's great to have come back from social media and put my effort in a location I have more control and ownership over. It feels different (good) to write and publish stuff here than on a platform and I think that's cool. 

More words, and code, to come! 

If you're looking for somewhere to explore further on this site, may I direct you to my [Contrasts page](https://aramzs.xyz/lists/contrasts/), a collection of fun color combinations that you can explore, double click to swap with the background, and find out how accessible they are. It's useful and fun!
