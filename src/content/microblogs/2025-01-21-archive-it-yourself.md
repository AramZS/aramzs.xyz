The Internet Archive is great, but it is never more vulnerable to legal action than now and has also responded to take down requests in the past. That's necessary, The Archive as a whole should preserve itself. So, if the federal government hosts something important to you, archive it yourself.

PDFs are already coming down, get copies and if they are offline, get them from The Archive where you can. Otherwise you can use:

- Conifer is a remotely hosted tool [conifer.rhizome.org](https://conifer.rhizome.org/)
- Webrecorder lets you archive locally, from your browser, as you see them [webrecorder.net/archivewebpage](https://webrecorder.net/archivewebpage/)

Do not use archive dot is, the service does not persist effectively and isn't trustworthy. 

If you want advanced tools and are capable of using python or docker, try archivebox [archivebox.io](https://archivebox.io/).

If you only care about the text of a page, pay for [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/), or use a plugin I worked on: [PressForward](https://wordpress.org/plugins/pressforward/).

Finally, don't forget you can always print to PDF. If the page is obscured, open developer tools and delete the divs that are in the way. The print view takes the current version of the loaded page, edits and all. You can always PDF it.

Last time around a lot of folks got real worried, but the admin proved very bad at taking down parts of the federal government's web presence. They're already more effective today than they were in two years of the last time he was in office.

If something does disappear from The Internet Archive, do not get mad at The Archive. Their very existence is at risk [due to the publishing houses' and music labels' bs lawsuits](https://www.wired.com/story/internet-archive-loses-hachette-books-case-appeal/). They are doing what they have to do in order to keep one of humanities greatest achievements keep running.

One last tip: if you believe something is at particular risk to disappear from The Internet Archive and is already offline from the web, you can use all these techniques to archive an Internet Archive page.

More detailed instructions for all this coming soon.
