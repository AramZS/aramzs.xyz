I think that there's a big problem with how we report on major incidences of violence now. Mainstream reporting assumes Law Enforcement is trustworthy & tells the truth, but considering already mangled messaging from earlier we have to assume the FBI cannot be trusted to tell the truth to the press.

Really worth noting that as far as I can tell [we've already had one LE agency disagreement yesterday](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/11/us/politics/fbi-patel-kirk-shooting.html) and it sounds like reporting today has already got conflicts between responses from standard background sources and official ones
