I gotta say people... you can report on the swastika shirt without sharing a screenshot of the shirt on social media. It's not particularly desirable to circulate a whole bunch of photos of Nazi paraphernalia and we shouldn't normalize it, regardless of the reason.

[Kanye West is doing Nazi shit and he wants to circulate their imagery](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/yes-website-selling-swastika-shirts-boosting-profile-super-bowl-ad-rcna191432) because it pushes the envelope to do so and ends up making what he's doing more acceptable whether you intend it that way or not.

You might be sharing the image to criticize it but you're still furthering his objective: putting that image in the faces of more people, many of whom didn't ask for it. That ends up weakening the social resistance to the symbol.
