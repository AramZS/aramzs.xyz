More than anything else reading [these 'ChatGPT drives someone insane'](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/chatgpt-ai-philosophical-psychosis-1235404568/) articles can feel like normies have discovered an addictive MMORPG. Some guy goes into a mental health crisis arguing about True Meaning? Pretty sure I had a guildy do that. I don't know if that analysis lends itself to any solutions, but it just strikes me as familiar.

I dunno, if we reframed ChatGPT etc... as a video game would people be more, or less, likely to parse it in a healthy way? On one hand: more informative and correct in how its interaction patterns work. On the other hand people fall down these rabbit holes in gaming anyway.

I do sort of like the idea of referring to 'working' with ChatGPT as 'playing' which feels more accurate. 

Maybe the trick is everyone has to put one hour into EVE Online for every 3 hours a week they spend it ChatGPT? That'll teach 'em responsibility.
