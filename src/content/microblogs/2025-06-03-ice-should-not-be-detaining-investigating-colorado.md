This guy is terrible, he did a terrible thing, I'm Jewish and there's no question in my mind that it was a hate crime. 

ICE is not the right agency to be involved and normalizing the use of ICE for this type of law enforcement task is terrifying. 

ICE is terrible and we should get rid of it.

Putting aside the fact that we do not have any clear proof the person's family was involved, or not legally in the US. [The person doesn't seem to be here illegally? Even if he was, ICE is not the FBI. It is not the appropriate law enforcement agency for this even if it was a good organization](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/family-boulder-attack-suspect-taken-ice-custody-dhs-chief-krisi-noem-s-rcna210711).   

The separation of domains of responsibility for law enforcement may be somewhat of a TV joke in pop culture but it's pretty important and stems from the work of elected officials to designate those domains of responsibility. Having the admin swing ICE around like a bat is bad for a lot of reasons.

I'm not a big fan of our justice system, even less so these days, and how it handles prisons. But: having ICE handle the suspect, family, and investigation, risks the state's chances to successfully prosecute them. Besides the problem of it not being their job, they don't have the right training.

Having the wrong law enforcement agency process the case might lead to it being thrown out of court. Which would be bad! This is not what ICE is for. 

Also, ICE is bad. Never forget it was only created in 2003. We shouldn't have it, we don't need it, and as an organization they've made it very clear this year that they are compromised inside and out and we cannot--as citizens--trust them. Picking this up is the least of the reasons why.
