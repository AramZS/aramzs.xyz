I'm really excited about this! One of the things that has worried me the most about using Bridgy Fed is that it was the work of a single project owner while doing some terribly important things and providing major infrastructure to the indie web. I'm extremely happy to hear that it will receive additional support and become more sustainable by gaining the custodianship of a non-profit.
