This is an incredibly depressing read. Basically just *one* agency's personnel loss is increasing the threat of starvation; catastrophic environmental damage due to invasive species; and an increase in sickness across the United States. 

We're just shooting ourselves in the foot over and over, and this is a **slice** of the issues. Every agency has staffers for a reason, with oversight over things that have major impact on our day-to-day lives and they are all being cut. 

The right loves to talk about the deaths that were 'caused by communism' but capitalism's misappropriation of resources is already [an equally terrible killer, if not worse](https://youtu.be/6HjTfm_D3sE?si=wB_sN5TZp0VoqhV5). It just never had the figurehead to attribute it to. 

If we last long enough I wonder if historians will look back on Trump and Musk as perpetrators of an unscientific political system, based on a bankrupt understanding of an economic philosophy, that killed millions in the same way we talk about Stalin. 

> Lahar and other supply chain experts warn that the losses could cause food to go rotten while waiting in ports and could lead to even higher grocery prices, in addition to increasing the chances of potentially devastating invasive species getting into the country. These dangers are especially acute at a moment when US grocery supply chains are already reeling from other business disruptions such as bird flu and President Trump’s new tariffs.
