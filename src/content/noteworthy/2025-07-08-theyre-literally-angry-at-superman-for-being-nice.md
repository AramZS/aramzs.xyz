Parker Molloy gets right to the point of how ridiculous the conservative blowback on the new Superman film is. 

> This isn't really about Superman. It's about how conservative media takes the most innocuous statements and transforms them into culture war ammunition. It's about how the right-wing ecosystem has become so reflexively oppositional that even "basic human kindness" reads as a partisan attack.
