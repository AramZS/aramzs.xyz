This line gave me shivers: 

> To investors, this critical infrastructure failure doesn’t look like fragility but like a chance to profit.

I love a good call to action:

> Rewilding an already built environment isn’t just sitting back and seeing what tender, living thing can force its way through the concrete. It’s razing to the ground the structures that block out light for everyone not rich enough to live on the top floor.

This piece is long, but highly recommended, especially if you're interested in the future of the web. It hits on so many points I don't think I can do a good job of summarizing it. I highly recommend the list of recommendations at the bottom. 

Technologist as a [crisis discipline](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1600-0498.12149)? Makes sense to me.
