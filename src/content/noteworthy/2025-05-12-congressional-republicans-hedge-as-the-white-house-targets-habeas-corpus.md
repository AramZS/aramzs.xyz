This is nightmare mode shit, really terrifying in terms of the implications of what the Federal government could do if habeas corpus is suspended. It's hard to understand why this isn't ringing every alarm bell. 

> If the White House were to suspend the bedrock legal principle, the Trump administration would have the power to lock people up without charges and prisoners would not have the ability to contest their incarceration.

> Steve Vladeck, a constitutional law professor at Georgetown University, described Miller’s statement on Substack as “factually and legally nuts” and called it the “most remarkable (and remarkably scary) comments about federal courts that I think we’ve ever heard from a senior White House official.”
