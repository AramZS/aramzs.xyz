> If you thought nothing could be worse than losing a child, two days after Legend was killed, the county district attorney charged the Jenkinses with involuntary manslaughter and persuaded a judge to set bail at $1.5 million for each of them.

In America, a car hits your kid and the car can't be at fault. Your kid gets shot by a gun, the gun owner can't really be blamed. The pattern is clear - humans and their lives are the least important part of American culture. The car, the gun, the industrial plan poisoning your water, they have more rights than you. 

Did you drink poisoned water, the power plant is going to sue you for defamation when you speak up. Got shot by a gun with an improper safety? The companies that make guns have no role in that. [One of the 40,000 people a year killed by a car crash](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7408a2.htm)? The cars have no role in that, the drivers are not at fault when they hit a pedestrian. You should know better than to walk in America.

The shift in responsibility robs people of their lives and destroys our lives in a broader way, it makes us more afraid, more worried about going out, less healthy. It changes how children grow up in America.
