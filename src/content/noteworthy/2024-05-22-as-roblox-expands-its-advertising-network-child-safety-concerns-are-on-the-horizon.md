This is a good review. Notable that Roblox appears to be reserving the right to change its privacy policy to potentially advertise to U13 in the future. Not addressed though is the fact that state and federal laws increasingly considering U18 the new U13.

Roblox might be able to make a good amount of ad money in the next few years, but the movement of U13 standards to the U18 point seems inevitable these days, which means that revenue has a major deadline on it.

> If Roblox does change its privacy policy to more explicitly require parental consent for targeted advertising, it could risk making parents more wary about other forms of advertising that already exist on the platform, such as branded experiences. As Roblox continues to expand its advertising offerings, it will have to find a path forward that satisfies everyone in its digital ecosystem â€” including brands, users and potential regulators.
