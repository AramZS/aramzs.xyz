> Nothing about the web has changed that prevents us from going back. If anything, it's become a lot easier. We can return. Better, yet: we can restore the things we loved about the old web while incorporating the wonderful things that have emerged since and developing even better things as we go forward. 

I found this piece very inspiring. Even if the web feels shitty right now, we've come so far, done so much to make it accessible to anyone, and we can do so much more. She's right when she says that we can choose to go over the walls and into the wilds to grow what we want; very aligned with my own way of thinking about the future.
