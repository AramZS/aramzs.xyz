New member of Check My Ads Arielle Garcia is really great in this brief interview with Marketing Brew.

> I want to understand why there’s a billion-dollar third-party verification industry that doesn’t do its job, that’s certified by two trade groups or accreditation bodies that seem fairly slow to respond until their feet are put to the fire.

This is such a banger question, one I've also been asking for years. I'm hoping that Garcia's new role as director of intelligence will lead to answering that question along with some of the other great ones she asks in this piece.
