I am a George Mason University alumni and I'm proud to see my university and its president stand up for itself, its diversity, and its independence. 

> The refusal has made the George Mason president one of the few university leaders who has explicitly, and publicly, challenged the Trump administration. He joins a short list of other higher education leaders, including the presidents of Harvard and Princeton.
>
> But unlike many of his peers, Dr. Washington has been targeted as an individual, and so his choice to resist the Trump administrationâ€™s demands leaves him in an uncommonly precarious position.
