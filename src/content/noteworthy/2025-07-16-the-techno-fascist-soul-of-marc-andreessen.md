So much of the specific flavor of authoritarianism coming out of Tech culture is very fundamentally anti-labor. 

> When tech workers began to organize, demanding that their employers live up to their stated values, ⁠⁠Andreessen reportedly saw them as having gone "feral."This revealing choice of words underscores a profound disdain for worker agency. In his view, employees are tools, not stakeholders; their awakening to social consciousness is a betrayal, a disruption of the natural order where billionaires command and labor obeys.

It's important to note how go-fast translates into a more elaborate plan. Go too fast to think hard about what we're working towards. Go too fast to question who is in charge. Go too fast to care about who falls by the wayside. Go so fast you don't notice they're [pulling up the ladder you're running towards](https://www.liberalcurrents.com/marc-andreessen-is-a-traitor/). Go fast because you are a cog and your only value is how long it takes you to be worn down. Andreessen and his ilk's attitudes are deeply inhumane.
