I have a light form of asthma, so the news that Trump's EPA is trying to deregulate greenhouse gasses and other emissions by intentionally sacrificing their authority to regulate that class of pollutants is uhhh... life threatening. 

America and the world spent so much time and effort trying to end acid rain and the hole in the ozone and it is one of the true climate change success stories!

The idea that the EPA would give up its capacity to prevent acid rain and ozone issues from occurring again is insane. Deregulating the EPA has huge impact on air quality and will affect people all over the world, even those without pre-existing breathing problems. 

That alone is terrifying and depressing, but it is hard to separate that risk from the very personal danger such a decision would put on me. I'm already sensitive to the increasing number of poor air-quality days. There were even a very few days in Virginia in which I just could not breathe while outside. This change would--given enough time--make going outside on many more days of the year impossible.

> The so-called endangerment finding that the EPA proposed revoking on Tuesday forms the legal basis for the government’s authority to impose limits on certain emissions, which scientists say are responsible for climate change and health issues such as breathing problems.

Fuck Zeldin for this. "The climate change religion" is total bullshit for anyone to say. Climate change is a well-proven, scientifically clear, set of facts and studies. To pretend, or be so ignorant, as to think otherwise, is infuriating. 

This a good time to [link the hbomberguy video on Climate Denial](https://youtu.be/RLqXkYrdmjY?si=5AmqAhR1QKb0lfd3).

I can't believe this video is 6 years old. I can't believe we still have to deal with these moron bad-faith climate change denials. I can't believe we have to deal with the head of the EPA endangering us and the whole rest of the world. 

> Earlier in the day, Zeldin said on the conservative “Ruthless” podcast that the rescission would be the “largest deregulatory action in the history of America,” which will “driv[e] a dagger into the heart of the climate change religion.”
