When SNAP ends, don't let anyone say otherwise: this is entirely on Trump

{% image 'src/images/snap-gov-msg.png' 'Senate Democrats have now voted 12 times to not fund the food stamp program, also known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Bottom line, the well has run dry. At this time, there will be no benefits issued November 01. We are approaching an inflection point for Senate Democrats. They can continue to hold out for healthcare for illegal aliens and gender mutilation procedures or reopen the government so mothers, babies, and the most vulnerable among us can receive critical nutrition assistance.'

We already have the money saved and allotted! Trump just refuses to release it.

When people talk about this I want to emphasize: we have not run out of money for SNAP. The money is there, it has been allotted and saved specifically for this instance. Trump refuses to release the billions of dollars that Americans have already allotted to continue food stamps!

> In the 60-year history of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, it’s never run out of money. Here are the states suing the federal government over it.

$5 billion has been allotted to keep Americans from starving. Trump would rather starve them!

> The Trump administration is rejecting the idea of using roughly $5 billion in contingency funds to keep food aid flowing into November amid the government shutdown , according to a Department of Agriculture memo that surfaced Friday.
