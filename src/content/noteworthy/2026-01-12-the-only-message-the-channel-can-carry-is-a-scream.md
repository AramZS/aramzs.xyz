> The only kind of information that such a constrained channel can carry is a scream. Populist politics acts as a signalling system for a population which wants to convey a single bit of information; the message that translates as “HELP! THE CURRENT STATE OF AFFAIRS IS INTOLERABLE TO ME”.

Ended up at this piece [from a really great video essay about how slop AI content flows from an economy of risk adverse mega-corps](https://youtu.be/Km2bn0HvUwg?si=QevniKupaJ7YkpSD) who have been producing slop for a while now. All in order to avoid any forms of risk and deliver shareholder value.  

It struck me as very correct. A lot of people vote for a lot of reasons and our system, even if it was built for multiple parties, gives very few choices. People, it seems, now only vote for a change. To end the current state of things (or not). 

It feels right to understand the last decade-ish of ping-ponging national politics not as any real expression of specific combinations of policy choices or enlightenment or darkness, but as a SCREAM, one that says *'this isn't working, anything but this, please, anything but this'*.

While that is a very depressing thought in many ways, it is also somewhat hopeful. Trump is fixing nothing. The scream continues. The current state will not hold. 

> I think this is what explains the common thread between MAGA, Brexit, Five-Star, Hindutva and all the rest. The populist movements of the 2010s all promised a simpler world; they were, in the words of JK Galbraith, taking on the great anxiety of their people and addressing it. They were also promising to restore the broken communication channels – to make voices heard, to force the managerial class to listen.
