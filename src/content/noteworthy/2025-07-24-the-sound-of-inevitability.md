Great piece by Tom Renner I'm seeing popping up in a number of places. Techbros and PR flacks are constructing a specific inevitable vision of the future with AI but none of it has happened yet, none of these choices have actually been made, the pushers of bad LLM systems are just trying to pretend them into being. They're trying to force use through [tricks of UI](https://limitesnumeriques.fr/travaux-productions/ai-forcing/en) and marketing. They are not guaranteed to succeed unless everyone lets them. 

> I’m not convinced that LLMs are the future. I’m certainly not convinced that they’re the future I want. But what I’m most certain of is that we have choices about what our future should look like, and how we choose to use machines to build it.

> Don’t let inevitabilism frame the argument and take away your choice. Think about the future you want, and fight for it.
