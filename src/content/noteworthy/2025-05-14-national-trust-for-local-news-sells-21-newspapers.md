I'm going to be harsh here, but I don't see how most non-profit news survives the next four years. Outliers like ProPublica will be fine, but outside of a few very large well supported publications the environment for non-profit fundraising is so toxic right now, especially for media, that it's hard to imagine a path forward for most media non-profits. 

> “The acquisition will allow the National Trust to invest in serving seven communities in Adams, Weld, and Jefferson counties where the organization believes it can have a unique and sustained impact,” this week’s announcement read. “These communities have fewer alternative sources of local news, tend to be more rural and diverse, and are farther from Denver’s city limits. The organization will expand its local journalism there while driving digital audience and revenue growth.”
