Anyone who has had more than 2 conversations with me has heard me talk about how Honey has sabotaged the opportunity of affiliate marketing for media for years. Seems like they finally went too far with influencers as well.

More on this [on Twitter as well](https://x.com/Chronotope/status/1872323910076948891).

I think that the unique moment of scam hunter influencers has produced the conditions where someone publicly pays attention to this now.

Hopefully someone follows up in a more mainstream platform and finally does the work to chase them off the web. Down with Honey. It is a blight on the web and the potential of the media to run as a stable business online.

> Was Honey a legitimate money saving tool? Or just an affiliate marketing scam promoted by some of YouTube's biggest influencers? [Yes]
