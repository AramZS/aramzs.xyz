This is insane. 

Among the many blatant breeches of baseline normal reality for American politics this one should be especially notable because it isn't just the executive branch doing a crazy illegal thing, this is line GOP in the House straight up refusing to swear in a duly elected official for no real reason.

Really should make you question anyone who says the party will just return to normal if Trump is pushed out of office. 

> It’s unclear why Grijalva has not been sworn in, though she has a hypothesis: that it has to do with her stance on the federal investigation into convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and her identity.
> 
> The former explanation has been offered by at least two Republicans and many Democrats. They claim that Johnson has shut down the House to block a vote on a bill requiring the release of federal investigative files into Epstein’s crimes.
