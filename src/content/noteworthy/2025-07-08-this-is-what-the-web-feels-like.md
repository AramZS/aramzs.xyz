As a long time follower of Dave Winer's work it was super satisfying to discover that we'd organically ended up at a perfectly compatible solution for amplification. He calls his a Link Blog and on here it's the Amplified section, with its Amplifeed RSS. I was really happy he liked my iteration and choose to write about it on his own blog. 

His approach is built on top of WordPress and is very cool. I'm planning to continue to play around with how I build on and use RSS, and it's great to see that a bunch of us out there are thinking similarly about how to build on the open web and outside the capture of the mainstream social media platforms.
