I appreciate and 100% co-sign this strong statement by Molly white about the importance of documenting the world we're in now. It matters to bear witness. It matters to keep a record. It matters to maintain a collective memory. 

In a time where so much of our media is less dependable and more subject to influence by bad actors, where the web is overwhelmed with slop, and where everything is harder to find and less likely to stay online, keeping our own records and our own first draft of history is vitally important. 

This is the reason [I've been going around trying to teach people how to do their own archiving](https://aramzs.github.io/steal-the-internet/). Even keeping the record is in itself important. 

> they’re expressions of a much broader resignation I’m seeing on- and offline: That caring is somehow naive. That documenting the truth is pointless. That hope is for fools.

> Let me be clear: It fucking matters. Truth matters. Documentation matters. Fighting corruption matters. That accountability seems out of reach right now doesn’t change that. When we internalize the belief that nothing can change, we stop demanding change. When we accept corruption as normal, we stop fighting it. When we dismiss documentation of wrongdoing as pointless, we give wrongdoers exactly what they want: permission to continue unchecked and with no record of their actions.

> I understand the despair in these kinds of responses. We’ve all watched impeachments fail, courts falter, institutions buckle, and politicians repeatedly trade away democracy for their next campaign check. But giving up on the very idea that truth and morality matter is not just cynicism, it’s surrender.

> Without a commitment to documenting truth, all that’s left is propaganda.
