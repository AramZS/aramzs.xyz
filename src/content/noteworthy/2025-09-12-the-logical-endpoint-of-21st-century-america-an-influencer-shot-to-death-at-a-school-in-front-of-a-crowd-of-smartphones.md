Charlie Kirk spent his life trying to create excuses to incite violence against others, now--as Ryan Broderick so elegantly notes in this piece--he has become that excuse. [Kirk doesn't deserve your respect](https://aramzs.xyz/noteworthy/charlie-kirk-does-not-deserve-your-respect/) or sympathy but I agree that it seems likely he'll be holding the whole nation's attention for a while.

> If 9/11 was the pinnacle of political violence for the TV age, Kirk’s death should be seen as an inverted mirror image, a perfect spectacle for the social media era. A darkly fitting end for the premier digital propagandist of the Trump administration. The same algorithms he relied on to create narratives for the MAGA movement now turning his death into a dizzying torrent of content. Shitposts, memes, conspiracy theories, and delirious right-wing lust for civil war have spun together online over the last 24 hours more intensely than we’ve ever seen before. The logical endpoint of 21st-century America: An influencer shot to death at a school in front of a crowd of smartphones.
