> It's cheating you out of your ability and your opportunity to be human. The thing with AI art is the only one losing out is you. 

A really good video that goes into some important questions. Even if AI does become effective at truly convincing images, that isn't the most important thing, the important thing is what we do with ourselves, how we create, and how we maintain our humanity.
