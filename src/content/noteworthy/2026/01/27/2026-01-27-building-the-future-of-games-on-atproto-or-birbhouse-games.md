The more I understand about ATProto and see people implementing in the ATmosphere, the more I think it could become the basis of some really interesting games. 

I really like the ideas here and I'm really interested in the ideas around a game that saves player objects to a PDS and pulls content from a creator PDS. It seems potentially very robust and like it would be a foundation for some specific very interesting types of games. 

> Imagine creating a Bluesky account for your game that becomes the source of truth for all its information. Every store listing, every review site, every blog post could pull directly from your authoritative source. Update your game's description once, and it propagates everywhere. Fix a credit, add a new feature, adjust your release date — all from one place you control.

> Achievements and save games could live in player repositories instead of developer servers. No more lost progress when a game's servers shut down. No more platform-locked achievements that disappear when you switch from Xbox to PlayStation.
