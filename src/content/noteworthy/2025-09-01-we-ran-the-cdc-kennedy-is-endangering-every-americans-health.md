Watching what RFK Jr. is doing I am struck with the feeling that it is incredibly predictable, terrifying and will have further impacts we can't predict. Why wasn't this written before he was confirmed? Why not before the firings? None of this was hard to see coming. 

I think that even this is not strongly worded enough. 

> What Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has done to the C.D.C. and to our nation’s public health system over the past several months — culminating in his decision to fire Dr. Susan Monarez as C.D.C. director days ago — is unlike anything we have ever seen at the agency, and unlike anything our country has ever experienced.

Amid the largest measles outbreak in the United States in a generation, he’s [focused on](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/health/measles-treatments-vaccines-kennedy.html) unproven “treatments” while downplaying vaccines.

He [replaced](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/11/well/vaccines-cdc-rfk-jr.html) experts on federal health advisory committees with unqualified individuals who share his dangerous and unscientific views. He announced the end of U.S. support for global vaccination programs that protect millions of children and keep Americans safe, [citing](https://www.statnews.com/2025/07/02/rfk-jr-vaccines-former-cdc-director-tom-frieden-says-kennedy-mangled-science-in-gavi-decision/) flawed research and making inaccurate statements. And he [championed](https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1940089073391018352) federal legislation that will cause millions of people with health insurance through Medicaid to [lose](https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2025-06/Wyden-Pallone-Neal_Letter_6-4-25.pdf) their coverage. Firing Dr. Monarez — which led to the resignations of top C.D.C. officials — adds considerable fuel to this raging fire.
