I enjoyed this analysis of the whining, mostly by people who don't live here, about Mamdani winning the primary. This paragraph in particular: 

> I mean, a 33-year-old man talking about kindness, loving your neighbor, helping the poor!? We must get him out of here. Call Pontius Pilate! Heâ€™ll know what to do.
