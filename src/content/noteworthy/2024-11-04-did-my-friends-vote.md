I think [this is a really interesting project](https://didmyfriendsvote.org). It calls on you to activate your own community to vote directly by telling you who did or didn't vote and when. I like that idea, I want more projects that activate us within our own communities. But I think it also, accidentally, confronts you with the fact that this data is out there and available to anyone, something not a lot of people think about.
