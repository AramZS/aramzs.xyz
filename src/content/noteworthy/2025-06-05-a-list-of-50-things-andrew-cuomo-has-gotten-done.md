Really the first two of these 50 points are more than enough! But any New Yorker should really read the whole things, so they're totally clear on just how terrible Cuomo is. 

> 1. Sexually harassed 13 different women who worked for New York State, according to Department of Justice findings.
> 
> 2. Has so far used at least $19 million of taxpayer funds in his legal battle against his accusers, including, in one case, subpoenaing their gynecologist records.
