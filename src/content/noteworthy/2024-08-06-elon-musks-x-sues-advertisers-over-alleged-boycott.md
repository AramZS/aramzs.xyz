Can't believe [this](https://x.com/Chronotope/status/1820847772179800240) bullshit is where most people are going to hear about the WFA for the first time. There are so many reasons to be mad at WFA but 'doesn't want to place ads below naz* shit and Elon dead-naming his kid' is not even close to one of them.

What is a proposed alternative? Advertisers .... can't decide where their ads go? What is Free Speech Advocate Elon Musk even asking for? Advertiser-funded socialism for the internet? Advertisers must proportion their spend based on the need of a domain? What is this nonsense?

The NY Post is rabid in their coverage of this. But even they don't propose an alternative besides the defeat of their 'enemies'. Defeat & then what? Advertisers suddenly don't care about their ads being next to Eugenicist Boy and his dynamic duo of transphobia lady and race war propagandist?

Ben Shapiro too [has no particular imagination for what an alternative is in his complaints](https://x.com/Chronotope/status/1816152759520891020). They can't imagine that their bullshit is just too radical and distasteful for advertisers so it must be *conspiracy* and not people making first amendment choices.

They are all so used to being able to post whatever they want and having the broken ad tech system unknowingly route ads their way that they can't conceive of a world where advertisers actually take actions around where ads are placed. That's how badly ad tech has broken things.

> “Advertisers should not have to subsidize viewpoints they don’t agree with—in fact requiring so would be un-American and unconstitutional,” Wiley writes. “Elon Musk and X executives have the right, protected by the First Amendment, to say what they want online, even when it's inaccurate, and advertisers have the right to keep their ads away from it. It’s as simple as that.”
