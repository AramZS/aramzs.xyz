It's really tempting to see this Greenland stuff as nonsense, bullshit, the stupid spouting of an incompetent asshole. But [there are real reasons why the folks backing Trump would like to see it under American control](https://heatmap.news/sparks/trump-greenland-minerals-rare-earth) and it is actively impacting our relationship with other nations as Trump continues to act on what he says. 

Increasing the chaos of the world is bad and this seems like it is only going to get worse. 

> Leaving a meeting with members of the Foreign Affairs Committee in Parliament on Thursday, Frederiksen revealed that Trump had not retracted his statement. "The Americans have suggested that, unfortunately, we could end up in a situation where we work less together than we do today," she said, referring to the president-elect's threats to impose "high" tariffs on Danish exports if Copenhagen refused to cede Greenland to him.
