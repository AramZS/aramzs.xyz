I think this is a great nuanced take. It acknowledges something I agree with, that there are *uses* for generative AI, but that they simply may not be worth their impact or be projects aiming at desirable outcomes. 

While I think occasionally LLM systems like OpenAI give us useful outputs, I increasingly wonder if so much of the value people perceive from them is more a reflection of confidence that they feel in the technology over themselves, that allows them to become unblocked on things that they'd otherwise dither on. 

> they do a poor job of much of what people try to do with them, they can't do the things their creators claim they one day might, and many of the things they are well suited to do may not be altogether that beneficial.
