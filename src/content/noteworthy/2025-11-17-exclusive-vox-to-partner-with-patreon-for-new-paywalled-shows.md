Gated distribution points is a real major modern innovation in the publisher business. While there are a lot of tactics where we might say 'maybe this works', or 'maybe this makes money', registration-required feeds and paywalled distribution mechanisms like running podcasts through Patreon or subscriber-only RSS feeds at 404 feel like true evolution for media companies. They are making money for organizations right now. They come from the recognition that we are absolutely required to meet our readers where they live but we should operate our businesses on those surfaces as much as on our own. 

> On Monday, Vox is launching its membership program on Patreon, aiming to capture primarily podcast and video consumers. Executives from the media company told Semafor that Vox’s Patreon supporters will have access to ad-free content and exclusive videos, including two new exclusive series: The Docket, a human impact series focused on Supreme Court decisions, and What’s Working, a “solutions-focused series that highlights policies improving the lives of communities across the country.”
