This is functionally a Nuremberg law.

> The Supreme Court on Monday lifted a federal judge’s order prohibiting government agents from making indiscriminate immigration-related stops in the Los Angeles area that challengers called “blatant racial profiling.”
>
> The court’s brief order was unsigned and gave no reasons. It is not the last word in the case, which is pending before a federal appeals court and may again reach the justices.
>
> The court’s three liberal members dissented.
>
> “We should not have to live in a country where the government can seize anyone who looks Latino, speaks Spanish and appears to work a low wage job,” Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote, joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson.
> 
> “Rather than stand idly by while our constitutional freedoms are lost,” Justice Sotomayor added, “I dissent.”

Truly dark shit from the court majority in every respect. 

> Justice Kavanaugh said the four factors identified by Judge Frimpong can play a role in determining whom to stop. For instance, he wrote, unauthorized immigrants often work as day laborers in landscaping, agriculture or construction and “many of those illegally in the Los Angeles area come from Mexico or Central America and do not speak much English.”
> 
> Apparent ethnicity by itself is not a permissible reason to stop someone, he added, but it can be a relevant consideration in combination with other factors.
> 
> In dissent, Justice Sotomayor wrote that the administration and Justice Kavanaugh had “all but declared that all Latinos, U.S. citizens or not, who work low wage jobs are fair game to be seized at any time, taken away from work and held until they provide proof of their legal status to the agents’ satisfaction.”
