This is extremely worrisome. It feels more like Trump is asking for bribes and now at least one media company has given in and basically decided that it is easier to pay him off than to try and fight. This isn't normal.

> News organizations are on high alert after President-elect Trump filed yet another defamation lawsuit on Monday â€” and vowed to continue suing new outlets and influencers over their coverage.

> Why it matters: While there are political levers that Trump can pull to target media companies, harassment campaigns and lawsuits that drain companies of time, money, resources and trust are often easier and just as punitive.
