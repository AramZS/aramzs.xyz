I find it extremely depressing that Shopify can't come out and say that being responsible for the selling and distribution of the worlds most well known hate symbol endangers people and that dangerous hate is the reason they took [Kanye's store](https://aramzs.xyz/microblogs/the-yeezy-shirt/) down. 

It should be the reason. 

Or maybe the implication is indeed that they don't actually care about selling symbols of hate intended to incite people to violence.

> Shopify’s general counsel said the company took down musician Kanye West’s online store because of the potential for fraud, not because it was selling a Nazi T-shirt, an internal staff announcement obtained by The Logic reveals.
> 
> In the message, which was posted on Shopify’s Slack Tuesday morning, general counsel Jess Hertz said the swastika-emblazoned T-shirt listed for sale by West was “a stunt” and “not a good faith attempt to make money.” This, Hertz added, “brought with it the real risk of fraud.” It was for this reason, she added, that the store had been closed.
