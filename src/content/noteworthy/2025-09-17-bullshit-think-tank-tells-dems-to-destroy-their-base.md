Man this is just scummy, basically a conservative influence operation on the Democratic party run by a guy who never ran a successful candidate. 

Even worse, his only ideas are 'lie about climate change' and 'throw LGBTQ+ people under the bus'. 

Sounds terrible! 

> As Democrats search for their way out of the political wilderness, a new think tank, introduced on Wednesday, has some ideas about where the party went wrong.
> 
> Among them: too much emphasis on issues like climate change and L.G.B.T.Q. rights, and far too much deference to the powerful liberal organizations championing those causes at the expense, some argue, of appealing to voters in battleground states.

Insane to me that this guy's short pitch is 'all the current organizations supporting the democratic party, like the ACLU, are wrong and we should stop listening to them'. WTF? 

> Mr. Jentleson, in public and private conversations, has long had it out for “the groups,” his shorthand for the myriad organizations that support the Democratic coalition. An opinion essay he wrote shortly after Mr. Trump’s 2024 victory included 16 mentions of the “groups.”
