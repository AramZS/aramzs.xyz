With the latest news, now both YouTube and Facebook have been blamed (likely correctly) for driving countries into significant governmental instability. Things are going great over in Silicon Valley.

> PPP leader Han Dong-hoon, a former confidant of Yoon who went on to advocate for the president's impeachment, announced his resignation on Monday and blamed South Korea's right-wing media for creating divisions among conservatives.
>
> "If we sympathise with extremists like the conspiracy theorists and extreme YouTubers, or if we are consumed by their commercially produced fears, there is no future for conservatism," said Han, who was a common target of Ko's criticism.
>
> A columnist for the conservative-leaning JoongAng Ilbo newspaper on Friday said Yoon's "YouTube addiction" had ruined his regime.
>
> "If you are addicted to YouTube, you fall into a world of delusion dominated by conspiracy theories... President Yoon watched too much YouTube," the column said.
