This is a great response. I think that this problem of "Abstraction-itis" is a common one among engineers, I tend to call it "engineering brain" but it's basically losing track of the forest you're in to focus on a specific tree. I think the software development mindset often encourages us to go deep on a problem and think heavily about how to solve it but doesn't encourage us to step back and consider: is this a problem I should be solving? Is this even a bug/problem or is it my code that's making the wrong assumptions and I'm just deepening them?
