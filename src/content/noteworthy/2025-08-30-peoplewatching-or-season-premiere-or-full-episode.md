It's so great to see Winston Rowntree's animated series back from [the depths of Cracked's abandoned and misused archives](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buKMOxNzYjY). As it did before, the [unique illustration style Rowntree employees](https://viruscomix.com/subnormality.html) in his work makes the people and their personalities stand out, where everyone is clearly an individual with depth and a backstory and a universe of meaning behind them. Combined with [the return of excellent music choices](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/38uLubixvjB6NPSydU7YVl) every episode of the first two seasons of People Watching had the surprising capability to could match the depth of Rowntree's character work. 

The new episode holds up to the old standards, perhaps even exceeding them--notably it has a smoother feel and more distinctive look to the animation and action. It's another glimpse that scrapes the surface of the show's characteristic urbanites struggling for meaning and connection. I am looking forward to seeing more.
