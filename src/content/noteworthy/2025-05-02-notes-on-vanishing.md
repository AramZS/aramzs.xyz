I'm putting a spotlight on Lily Alexandre's latest  "weird, deeply unmarketable [video]" "Notes on Vanishing."

The video essay manages to explore a fascinating culture of film that I'm not at all familiar with as a gateway into a discussion of trans rights and questions about trans visibility. 

It's a really excellent piece that takes advantage of all the best things one can do with a video essay while making a really through exploration of the subject. I really recommend watching. 

I also added it to my context page [on Trans Kids, Puberty Blockers, and Gender Affirming Care](https://context.center/topics/trans-kids-gender-affirming-care/)

> I don't think it is from our presence in pop culture. The art about trans people that predates the backlash: shows like Post, Transparent, Orange is the New Black; musical artists like SOPHIE; books from Janet Mock, and Kai Cheng Thom; were all received pretty well.

> I doubt anyone who engaged with them were left more fearful than then they had been. I don't think it's a failure of public messaging either, activists being too extreme or confrontational. 
>
> Actually I think trans people expend a ton of effort trying to explain ourselves to the public. So many of us spend time forging connections with people who don't get it; debunking myths; getting really personal about the details of our lives.

> The internet hosts thousands of surgery diaries in which people vlog about the details of their genital situation from hospital beds. You don't bear your soul that way unless you really want to be understood.
