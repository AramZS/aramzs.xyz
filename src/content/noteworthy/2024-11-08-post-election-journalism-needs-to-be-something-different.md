I think this is a good instinct when thinking about how media needs to evolve in the aftermath of the election. The instinct to turn **all** media into national publications hasn't served it well.

The business and philanthropy world has failed journalism. Journalism in turn has failed you. And here we are.

> One thing that has become crystal clear to me is that even without robust, functioning local news, my community still needs basic civic information. So here's one thing I'm doing: Setting up a new site for my town that will hold a library of existing resources like maps, local flood analyses, comprehensive planning, local history, resources for local households and families, etc. If I can get enough local interest in it, the site will also host a calendar of local upcoming public meetings, announcements, arts and community events, things of that nature.
