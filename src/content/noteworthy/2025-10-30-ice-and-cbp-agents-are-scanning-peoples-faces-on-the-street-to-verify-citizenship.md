I just went through JFK from abroad and the only gates set up for US passport holders were iPads taking photos of your face. If you use your legal right to decline, like I did, you were shunned into an extra 30m wait

Our entire security apparatus, bs as it may be, is being refashioned into total dependency on unreliable, racist, facial recognition systems.
