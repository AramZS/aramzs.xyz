> The move comes over the objections of local leaders, despite the fact violent crime plunged to a 30-year low last year, according to data compiled by the U.S. Department of Justice. A DOJ announcement posted earlier this year boasted that crime in Washington had plunged across a wide range of indicators.

> "In addition to the overall violent crime reduction, homicides are down 32%; robberies are down 39%; armed carjackings are down 53%; assaults with a dangerous weapon are down 27% when compared with 2023 levels, with the District reporting the fewest assaults with dangerous weapons and burglaries in over 30 years," the DOJ statement said.
