> “'The tech industry actually doesn't need any tax breaks,' Ryan tells WIRED. 'What we do need is a city where all kinds of super smart people who are between the age of 20 and 40 want to come work.'”

Bingo. This doesn't surprise me.

I think you just can't isolate yourself into a smaug-like horde of wealth in NYC, even if you're a billionaire. Tech people here are, by necessity, on the streets, surrounded by every type of person. If live or work in NYC you can't avoid seeing people who don't look like you.

Being in NYC, even the most self-isolating bodyguard-toting rich dude is to some degree in community with the city in a way that the ultra-rich who hide out in the hills and offices of the West Coast just aren't. It doesn't surprise me that they see Mamdani and aren't frightened by him like they are in Silicon Valley.

Like, I think the West Coast ultra-wealthy are genuinely frightened by Mamdani because they can't imagine having to even slightly give back to their community, risking their ever increasing isolation from the world. They cannot imagine anything other than sitting separate in their highly selective, mostly white, mostly male, communities of other rich people.

This is the fundamental source of the reactionary billionaire on the west coast's reaction to Mamdani: they believe themselves superior and apart and want to devote every last resource to maintaining that separation. They see him as a risk, because he's asking people (here, not even there) to be in community

Their retainers & their suck-ups & hanger-ons align themselves with that because SV power comes in isolation. But in NYC power comes in community, participating in it and contributing to it. I think Mamdani really puts into focus that the SV Billionaire is about a total refusal to give anything back and basically nothing else.

> Much of the online discourse about Mamdani doesn’t focus on specific policies. Frequently mentioned, however, are Mamdani’s public comments about how billionaires would not exist in a just society in which workers are paid fairly and moderating forces on wealth inequality exist. Individuals like Y Combinator CEO Garry Tan have responded by wearing shirts that say “We should have more billionaires” in the color scheme and style of Mamdani’s campaign material.
