This post marks the point at which I'm branching off from the great work done over at [PhotoGabble](https://photogabble.co.uk/). I've been working on the site for a bit and adding some of my own features and types for the type of writing and content I want to create.

This is exciting as another major site project I've been itching to launch. 

What does this change? A few major things! It adds "[amplify](/amplify/)", a content type for linking to and amplifying good work elsewhere. This sits alongside "noteworthy" which deals with interesting links where I have something to say and "bookmarks" which are links I want to keep around and perhaps comment on. Amplify links are intended purely for sharing links without comment. 

I added a page of "[[words]]", which is just fun words I had to look up and I want to reuse. This is different from the "glossary" which is for working words that I use and reference in writing on the site. 

I changed "quotes" to "[resources/quotes](/resources/quotes/)". Previously this was a data file that rendered all the quotes to a single page. Now it is a content type that can be used to create individual pages for each quote. I leveraged that to pull all the highlights I made in my Kindle books and put them into the site.

Similarly I changed film and TV from a joined data file to individual files that I can pull out of data exports from stuff like Letterboxd and maybe Serializd. As part of that process I query up metadata and images from TMDB and add that to the pages. 

I've also added a "[resources/music](/resources/music/)" type which mirrors my feed from Song Obsessed, which is my blog on music.
