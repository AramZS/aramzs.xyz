This boilerplate wraps [Tuppence](https://github.com/photogabble/tuppence) with some project structure and includes a service provider for the [Plates PHP](http://platesphp.com/) template system and [Docrtine ORM](http://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/orm.html).

## Status

This boilerplate is to be considered **abandoned** alongside [Tuppence](/projects/tuppence/) itself and I will not be answering issues raised on the repository. I am however open to PRs if people choose to continue development of this project.

Contributors welcomed.
