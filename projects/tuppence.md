Tuppence is a very small unimposing library that brings together a [dependency injection container](http://container.thephpleague.com/), [router](http://route.thephpleague.com/) and [events](http://event.thephpleague.com/2.0/) all provided by _The League of Extraordinary Packages_.

I have [written here](/blog/programming/why-i-built-a-tiny-php-framework-called-tuppence/) about why I wrote Tuppence, the TL;DR version is that the micro framework [Proton](https://alexbilbie.com/2014/10/introducing-proton/) by Alex Bilbie was available but was by that point using out of date dependencies and rather than forking Proton I wanted to learn more about frameworks through building my own.

## Status

My last commit to Tuppence was in 2018; at the time I wrote it, it fit a small niche that I was working in whereas today I would likely use Next to provide both SPA + API. Because of this the project can be considered **Abandoned**, I will not be answering issues raised on the repository. I am however open to PRs if people choose to continue development of this project. 

Contributors welcomed.
