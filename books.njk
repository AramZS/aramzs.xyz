            This books page layout was inspired by the books pages of
            <a href="https://daverupert.com/bookshelf/">Dave Rupert</a>,
            <a href="https://www.markllobrera.com/reading/years/2020/">Mark Llobrera</a>,
            <a href="https://annualbeta.com/bookshelf/">SÃ¸ren Birkemeyer</a> and
            <a href="https://derekshirk.com/reads/">Derek Shirk</a>. I originally got the idea for a books page from
            <a href="https://maggieappleton.com/library">Maggie Appleton</a>. The first version of this page was inspired by
            <a href="https://www.coxchapman.com/books">Cox Chapman's Books page</a>.
